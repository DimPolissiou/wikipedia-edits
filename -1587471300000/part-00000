In late May Njaru was approached by the local [[captain (Navy)|captain]] who asked Njaru \"to stop writing such articles and to disclose his sources\". Refusing to do this, Njaru five days later found his house encircled by armed soldiers, and escaped to [[Kumba]].<ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/40142/Njaru-v-Cameroon-HRC-Decision |title=Njaru v Cameroon HRC Decision |accessdate=2008-09-14 |website=Scribd.com |date=3 April 2007 }}</ref> Here, he was assaulted by police in June 2001, with no particular reason stated.<ref name=\"UN\"/> Njaru complained to the local authorities, but later learned that \"his complaint had not been received\".<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nCameroon's Marine Nationale R\u00e9publique modernised and increased its capabilities during 2000 with the acquisition of a number of small Rodman patrol craft and the retirement of some small older craft. A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller inshore and river patrol craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions. Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40&nbsp;mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (P48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS-12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995. The Quartier-Ma\u00eetre Alfred Moto patrol boat was listed as out of service in 1991 but has since been reactivated.\n\n===Ships===\nList of active ships.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n* 1: DIPIKAR patrol boat (former French navy \"Gr\u00e8be\", upgraded with LYNCEA PATROL CMS) (Gun)\n* 2: FRA P-48 (Gun)\n* 6: Rodman 101/46 (Gun)\n* 1: Quartier class (Gun)\n* 3: [[Boston Whaler]] patrol boats\n* 1: Bakassi class patrol boat (P48S type)\n* 1: L\u2019Audacieux class missile FAC (P48 type)\n* 1: Alfred Motto class patrol craft\n* 20: [[Swiftships]] type river boats\n* 2: [[Type 067 landing craft utility|Yunnan landing craft utility]]\n* 8: Simoneau\n* 2: Aresa 2400 CPV Defender patrol boats <ref name=\"defenceweb1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33027&Itemid=106|title=Cameroon Navy receives new patrol vessels, landing craft - defenceWeb|first=Guy|last=Martin|website=Defenceweb.co.za|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>\n* 1: Aresa 2300 landing craft\n* 6: Aresa 750 Commandos RIBs\n* 5: 1200 Stealth RIBs\n* 1: 1200 Defcon RIB\n* 2:  P108 and P109 patrol boats\n\nTwo 32-metre patrol boats are expected to be delivered in February 2014.<ref name=\"defenceweb1\"/>\n\n==Gendarmerie==\nThe Gendarmerie is a paramilitary force composed of about 9,000 soldiers as of 2016.

A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller inshore and river patrol craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions. Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40&nbsp;mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (P48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS-12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995.

It relied on militia organised by local officials or private forces mobilised by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe.<ref>David G. Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 24\u201345.</ref> From the [[later Middle Ages]] until the English Civil War, when a foreign expeditionary force was needed, such as the one that [[Henry V of England]] took to France and that fought at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415), the army, a professional one, was raised for the duration of the expedition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/victorious-army-making-raising-king-henry-vs-army-1415/|title=A victorious army in the making: Raising King Henry V's army of 1415|date=11 August 2015|first=Benjamin|last=Trowbridge|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018013732/http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/victorious-army-making-raising-king-henry-vs-army-1415/|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the English Civil War, the members of the [[Long Parliament]] realised that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the [[Eastern Association]]), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The [[Self-denying Ordinance]] forbade members of parliament (with the notable exception of [[Oliver Cromwell]]) from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent ([[Congregational]]) in theology, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation for the creation of a Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General [[Thomas Fairfax]], which became known as the [[New Model Army]] (originally new-modelled Army).{{sfn|Rogers|1968|pp=207\u2013211}}\n\nWhile this proved to be a war-winning formula, the New Model Army, being organised and politically active, went on to dominate the politics of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the alleged excesses of the New Model Army under [[the Protectorate]] of Oliver Cromwell were used as propaganda (and still feature in Irish folklore) and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H.

In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the [[Scots Greys]] were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688 when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England.

The British Government considered Bermuda as an Imperial fortress, rather than a colony. After the French Revolution, the [[Governor of Bermuda]] was normally a military officer (usually a Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers) in charge of all military forces in Bermuda, with the Bermuda Garrison falling under the Nova Scotia Command. From 1868, the Bermuda Garrison became the independent Bermuda Command, with Governors being Lieutenant-Generals or Major Generals occupying the role of Commander-in-Chief or General Officer Commanding (GOC). Locally recruited reserve units, the Royal Artillery-badged [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] (BVRC) were raised again from 1894, later joined by the Royal Engineers-badged [[Bermuda Volunteer Engineers]] (1931-1946), [[General Service Corps]]-badged [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (1939-1946), and a Home Guard (1942-1946). After the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] was redesignated a naval base in 1951, the army garrison was closed in 1957, leaving only the part-time BMA (re-tasked as infantry in 1953, though still badged and uniformed as Royal Artillery) and BVRC (renamed Bermuda Rifles in 1949). The Bermuda Command Headquarters and all regular army personnel other than members of the Permanent Staff of the local Territorials and the [[Aide-de-Camp]] to the Governor of Bermuda (today normally a Captain from the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] employed full-time for the duration of the appointment) were withdrawn. Home defence has been provided by the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] since formed by the 1965 amalgamation of the BMA and Bermuda Rifles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-anglian-soldiers-boost-bermuda-regiment|title=Royal Anglian soldiers boost Bermuda Regiment|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723035810/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-anglian-soldiers-boost-bermuda-regiment|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Major units are [[regiment]]/[[battalion]]-sized, and minor units are [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized units (or [[platoon]]s). All units are Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (part-time).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNaming conventions of units differ for historical reasons, creating some confusion; the term \"battalion\" in the infantry is synonymous with cavalry, artillery or engineer regiment, and the infantry \"company\" is synonymous with an engineer or cavalry squadron and an artillery battery.

Although the [[Royal Artillery]] consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] are not [[corps]]-sized, but corps in this instance are administrative branches consisting of several battalions or regiments.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Operational structure ===\n{{See also|List of units and formations of the British Army 2020}}\n\nThe forces of the British Army after the [[Army 2020 Refine]] reforms are organised in garrison as:\n*The [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]] and a modified [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] will be the Army's primary armoured war-fighting force.

This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.<ref name=\"SAS\" />\n\nThe table below demonstrates how three or four battlegroups make up a [[brigade]] and three or four brigades make up a [[Division (military)|division.]] A division is currently the largest unit the British Army is capable of deploying independently, although it could be grouped with three or four other divisions from a multi-national coalition to form a [[corps]].<ref name=\"SAS\">\n{{cite web | title = British Army Formation & Structure | publisher = WhoDaresWins.com | year = 2011 | url = http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429010016/http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | archive-date = 29 April 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type of unit\n![[Division (military)|Division]]\n![[Brigade]]\n![[Battlegroup (army)|Battlegroup]]\n![[Battalion]], Regiment\n![[Company (military unit)|Company]], [[Squadron (cavalry)|Squadron]]\n![[Platoon]], [[Troop]]\n![[Section (military unit)|Section]]\n![[Fireteam|Fire Team]]\n|-\n!Contains\n|3 brigades\n|3\u20134 battalions (battlegroups)\n|Combined arms unit\n|4\u20136 companies\n|3 platoons\n|3 sections\n|2 fire teams\n|4 individuals\n|-\n!Personnel\n|15,000\n|5,000\n|700\u20131,000\n|720\n|120\n|30\n|8\u201310\n|4\n|-\n!Commanded by\n|[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Maj-Gen]]\n|[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brig]]\n|[[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]]\n|[[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]]\n|[[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj]]\n|[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Capt]], [[Lieutenant|Lt]] or [[2nd Lieutenant#United Kingdom and Commonwealth|2nd Lt]]\n|[[Corporal#United Kingdom|Cpl]]\n|[[Chosen man|LCpl]]\n|}\n\n==== Special forces ====\n[[File:uk-sas.svg|upright|thumb|alt=Emblem of a winged sword with the motto, \"Who dares, wins\"|SAS [[cap badge]]]]\n\nThe British Army contributes two of the three [[special forces]] formations to the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] directorate: the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) and [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]] (SRR).<ref name=\"PPUK\">{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|title=Special Reconnaissance Regiment|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050405/wmstext/50405m01.htm#50405m01.html_sbhd5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425053749/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050405/wmstext/50405m01.htm#50405m01.html_sbhd5|archive-date=25 April 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe SAS consists of one regular and two reserve regiments.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010 |publisher=[[Defence Analytical Services Agency]] |title=UK Defence Statistics 2009 |url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230645/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> The regular regiment, 22 SAS, has its headquarters at [[Stirling Lines]], [[Credenhill]], [[Herefordshire]].

When the [[English Empire]] was established in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early 17th century there was no standing English Army, only the [[Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)|Militia]], and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial militias fought side by side with it in a number of wars, including the [[Seven Years' War]]. Some of the colonial militias rebelled during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. The militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the [[War of 1812]]. With the growth of the empire around the world, ''\"non-European\"'' (i.e. non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and [[protectorate]]s, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The [[West India Regiment]]s were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army lists, unlike units such as the [[King's African Rifles]]. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, etc.) mostly achieved [[Dominion|Commonwealth Dominion]] status before or after the First World War and were granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments on a par with the British government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the [[Australian Army]]), although Canada retained the term \"militia\" for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming [[Commonwealth realm]]s (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).<ref>{{cite web | title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 | work=National Archives of Australia: Documenting a Democracy | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 | accessdate=8 August 2005 | url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075624/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 |archivedate=16 July 2005 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url = https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html|last=Bowden |first=James | first2=Philippe |last2=Lagass\u00e9 | title=Succeeding to the Canadian throne | date=6 December 2012 |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | accessdate=6 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding%2BCanadian%2Bthrone/7651371/story.html |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nUnits raised in [[Self-governing colony|self-governing]] and [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] that are part of the British realm remain under British control.

So Parliament initiated two actions. The [[Self-denying Ordinance]] forbade members of parliament (with the notable exception of [[Oliver Cromwell]]) from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent ([[Congregational]]) in theology, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation for the creation of a Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General [[Thomas Fairfax]], which became known as the [[New Model Army]] (originally new-modelled Army).{{sfn|Rogers|1968|pp=207\u2013211}}\n\nWhile this proved to be a war-winning formula, the New Model Army, being organised and politically active, went on to dominate the politics of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the alleged excesses of the New Model Army under [[the Protectorate]] of Oliver Cromwell were used as propaganda (and still feature in Irish folklore) and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H.

In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the [[Scots Greys]] were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688 when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and the Scots Greys eventually received the British Army rank of 2nd Dragoons.{{sfn|Royal Scots Greys|1840|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n=== British Empire (1700\u20131914) ===\n{{main|British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|British Army during the Victorian Era}}\n\nAfter 1700 British continental policy was to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain.

The British Government considered Bermuda as an Imperial fortress, rather than a colony. After the French Revolution, the [[Governor of Bermuda]] was normally a military officer (usually a Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers) in charge of all military forces in Bermuda, with the Bermuda Garrison falling under the Nova Scotia Command. From 1868, the Bermuda Garrison became the independent Bermuda Command, with Governors being Lieutenant-Generals or Major Generals occupying the role of Commander-in-Chief or General Officer Commanding (GOC). Locally recruited reserve units, the Royal Artillery-badged [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] (BVRC) were raised again from 1894, later joined by the Royal Engineers-badged [[Bermuda Volunteer Engineers]] (1931-1946), [[General Service Corps]]-badged [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (1939-1946), and a Home Guard (1942-1946). After the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] was redesignated a naval base in 1951, the army garrison was closed in 1957, leaving only the part-time BMA (re-tasked as infantry in 1953, though still badged and uniformed as Royal Artillery) and BVRC (renamed Bermuda Rifles in 1949). The Bermuda Command Headquarters and all regular army personnel other than members of the Permanent Staff of the local Territorials and the [[Aide-de-Camp]] to the Governor of Bermuda (today normally a Captain from the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] employed full-time for the duration of the appointment) were withdrawn. Home defence has been provided by the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] since formed by the 1965 amalgamation of the BMA and Bermuda Rifles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-anglian-soldiers-boost-bermuda-regiment|title=Royal Anglian soldiers boost Bermuda Regiment|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723035810/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-anglian-soldiers-boost-bermuda-regiment|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Under the Army 2020 Command structure, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] is in charge of Army Headquarters. There are four lieutenant-general posts in Army headquarters: the [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]], the [[Commander Field Army]], the Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] and the Commander [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482984/20151201-FOI201510480_76137_CFA_Restructure_ArmySec.pdf|title=Freedom of Information Act answer from Army Headquarters|publisher=Army Headquarters|accessdate=13 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222154409/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482984/20151201-FOI201510480_76137_CFA_Restructure_ArmySec.pdf|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Army Headquarters is responsible for providing forces at operational readiness for employment by the [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe command structure is hierarchical, with [[Division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s controlling groups of units. Major units are [[regiment]]/[[battalion]]-sized, and minor units are [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized units (or [[platoon]]s). All units are Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (part-time).<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNaming conventions of units differ for historical reasons, creating some confusion; the term \"battalion\" in the infantry is synonymous with cavalry, artillery or engineer regiment, and the infantry \"company\" is synonymous with an engineer or cavalry squadron and an artillery battery. The table below illustrates the different names for equivalent units.<ref name=\"SAS\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Infantry\n!Cavalry and Engineers\n!Artillery\n|-\n|Regiment (two or more battalions grouped for administration)\n|No equivalent\n|No equivalent\n|-\n|Battalion \n|Regiment\n|Regiment\n|-\n|Company\n|Squadron\n|Battery\n|-\n|Platoon\n|Troop\n|Troop\n|}\nAdding to the confusion is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the [[Royal Artillery]] consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] are not [[corps]]-sized, but corps in this instance are administrative branches consisting of several battalions or regiments.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Operational structure ===\n{{See also|List of units and formations of the British Army 2020}}\n\nThe forces of the British Army after the [[Army 2020 Refine]] reforms are organised in garrison as:\n*The [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]] and a modified [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] will be the Army's primary armoured war-fighting force.

An example of a battlegroup in the Reactive Force (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of armoured infantry (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example, it would be the 1 Mercian Battlegroup. This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.<ref name=\"SAS\" />\n\nThe table below demonstrates how three or four battlegroups make up a [[brigade]] and three or four brigades make up a [[Division (military)|division.]] A division is currently the largest unit the British Army is capable of deploying independently, although it could be grouped with three or four other divisions from a multi-national coalition to form a [[corps]].<ref name=\"SAS\">\n{{cite web | title = British Army Formation & Structure | publisher = WhoDaresWins.com | year = 2011 | url = http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429010016/http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-formation-structure-setup.html | archive-date = 29 April 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type of unit\n![[Division (military)|Division]]\n![[Brigade]]\n![[Battlegroup (army)|Battlegroup]]\n![[Battalion]], Regiment\n![[Company (military unit)|Company]], [[Squadron (cavalry)|Squadron]]\n![[Platoon]], [[Troop]]\n![[Section (military unit)|Section]]\n![[Fireteam|Fire Team]]\n|-\n!Contains\n|3 brigades\n|3\u20134 battalions (battlegroups)\n|Combined arms unit\n|4\u20136 companies\n|3 platoons\n|3 sections\n|2 fire teams\n|4 individuals\n|-\n!Personnel\n|15,000\n|5,000\n|700\u20131,000\n|720\n|120\n|30\n|8\u201310\n|4\n|-\n!Commanded by\n|[[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Maj-Gen]]\n|[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brig]]\n|[[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]]\n|[[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]]\n|[[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj]]\n|[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Capt]], [[Lieutenant|Lt]] or [[2nd Lieutenant#United Kingdom and Commonwealth|2nd Lt]]\n|[[Corporal#United Kingdom|Cpl]]\n|[[Chosen man|LCpl]]\n|}\n\n==== Special forces ====\n[[File:uk-sas.svg|upright|thumb|alt=Emblem of a winged sword with the motto, \"Who dares, wins\"|SAS [[cap badge]]]]\n\nThe British Army contributes two of the three [[special forces]] formations to the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] directorate: the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) and [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]] (SRR).<ref name=\"PPUK\">{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|title=Special Reconnaissance Regiment|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050405/wmstext/50405m01.htm#50405m01.html_sbhd5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425053749/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050405/wmstext/50405m01.htm#50405m01.html_sbhd5|archive-date=25 April 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe SAS consists of one regular and two reserve regiments.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=26 March 2010 |publisher=[[Defence Analytical Services Agency]] |title=UK Defence Statistics 2009 |url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230645/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/UK-defence-statistics-compendium/2009/2009.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> The regular regiment, 22 SAS, has its headquarters at [[Stirling Lines]], [[Credenhill]], [[Herefordshire]].

When the [[English Empire]] was established in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early 17th century there was no standing English Army, only the [[Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)|Militia]], and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial militias fought side by side with it in a number of wars, including the [[Seven Years' War]]. Some of the colonial militias rebelled during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. The militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the [[War of 1812]]. With the growth of the empire around the world, ''\"non-European\"'' (i.e. non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and [[protectorate]]s, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The [[West India Regiment]]s were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army lists, unlike units such as the [[King's African Rifles]]. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, etc.) mostly achieved [[Dominion|Commonwealth Dominion]] status before or after the First World War and were granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments on a par with the British government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the [[Australian Army]]), although Canada retained the term \"militia\" for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming [[Commonwealth realm]]s (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).<ref>{{cite web | title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 | work=National Archives of Australia: Documenting a Democracy | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 | accessdate=8 August 2005 | url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075624/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 |archivedate=16 July 2005 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url = https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html|last=Bowden |first=James | first2=Philippe |last2=Lagass\u00e9 | title=Succeeding to the Canadian throne | date=6 December 2012 |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | accessdate=6 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding%2BCanadian%2Bthrone/7651371/story.html |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nUnits raised in [[Self-governing colony|self-governing]] and [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] that are part of the British realm remain under British control.

It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a [[zonohedron]] (every face has point symmetry).\n\nThe cube can be cut into six identical [[square pyramid]]s. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces).\n\n==Other dimensions==\nThe analogue of a cube in four-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] has a special name\u2014a [[tesseract]] or [[hypercube]]. More properly, a hypercube (or ''n''-dimensional cube or simply ''n''-cube) is the analogue of the cube in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a ''measure polytope''.\n\nThere are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in dimension 0, a [[line segment]] in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.\n\n==Related polyhedra==\n[[Image:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|200px|right|The dual of a cube is an [[octahedron]], seen here with vertices at the center of the cube's square faces.]]\n[[File:Hemicube.svg|200px|thumb|The [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]] is the 2-to-1 quotient of the cube.]]\nThe quotient of the cube by the [[Antipodal point|antipodal]] map yields a [[projective polyhedron]], the [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]].\n\nIf the original cube has edge length 1, its [[dual polyhedron]] (an [[octahedron]]) has edge length <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2}/2</math>.\n\nThe cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:\n{|class=wikitable\n!Name!!Equal edge-lengths?!!Equal angles?!!Right angles?\n|-\n|'''Cube'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''\n|-\n|[[Rhombohedron]]||Yes||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]||No||Yes||Yes\n|-\n|[[Parallelepiped]]||No||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[quadrilateral]]ly faced hexahedron||No||No||No\n|}\n\nThe vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular [[tetrahedron]]; more generally this is referred to as a [[demicube]]. These two together form a regular [[polyhedral compound|compound]], the [[stella octangula]]. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.\n\nOne such regular tetrahedron has a volume of {{sfrac|1|3}} of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of {{sfrac|1|6}} of that of the cube, each.\n\nThe [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] cube is the [[cuboctahedron]]. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six [[octagon]]al faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons ([[truncated cube]]).

It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a [[zonohedron]] (every face has point symmetry).\n\nThe cube can be cut into six identical [[square pyramid]]s. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces).\n\n==Other dimensions==\nThe analogue of a cube in four-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] has a special name\u2014a [[tesseract]] or [[hypercube]]. More properly, a hypercube (or ''n''-dimensional cube or simply ''n''-cube) is the analogue of the cube in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a ''measure polytope''.\n\nThere are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in dimension 0, a [[line segment]] in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.\n\n==Related polyhedra==\n[[Image:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|200px|right|The dual of a cube is an [[octahedron]], seen here with vertices at the center of the cube's square faces.]]\n[[File:Hemicube.svg|200px|thumb|The [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]] is the 2-to-1 quotient of the cube.]]\nThe quotient of the cube by the [[Antipodal point|antipodal]] map yields a [[projective polyhedron]], the [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]].\n\nIf the original cube has edge length 1, its [[dual polyhedron]] (an [[octahedron]]) has edge length <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2}/2</math>.\n\nThe cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:\n{|class=wikitable\n!Name!!Equal edge-lengths?!!Equal angles?!!Right angles?\n|-\n|'''Cube'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''\n|-\n|[[Rhombohedron]]||Yes||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]||No||Yes||Yes\n|-\n|[[Parallelepiped]]||No||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[quadrilateral]]ly faced hexahedron||No||No||No\n|}\n\nThe vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular [[tetrahedron]]; more generally this is referred to as a [[demicube]]. These two together form a regular [[polyhedral compound|compound]], the [[stella octangula]]. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.\n\nOne such regular tetrahedron has a volume of {{sfrac|1|3}} of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of {{sfrac|1|6}} of that of the cube, each.\n\nThe [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] cube is the [[cuboctahedron]]. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six [[octagon]]al faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons ([[truncated cube]]). The [[rhombicuboctahedron]] is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount.\n\nA cube can be inscribed in a [[dodecahedron]] so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes.\n\nIf two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained.

{"title_page": "United States Telephone Herald Company", "text_new": "The '''United States Telephone Herald Company''', founded in 1909, was the parent corporation for a number of associated \"[[telephone newspaper]]\" companies, located throughout the United States, that were organized to provide news and entertainment over telephone lines to subscribing homes and businesses. This was the most ambitious attempt made to develop a distributed audio service prior to the rise of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.\n\nAt least a dozen associate companies were chartered, but despite initial optimism and ambitious goals, only two systems ever went into commercial operation \u2014 one based in Newark, New Jersey (New Jersey Telephone Herald, 1911-1912) and the other in Portland, Oregon (Oregon Telephone Herald, 1912-1913). Moreover, both of these systems were shut down after operating for only a short time, due to economic and technical issues.\n\nCorporation activity peaked in 1913, but the lack of success caused the company to suspend operations, and the corporation charter for the United States Telephone Herald Company was repealed in early 1918.\n\n==Company history==\n\n[[File:1910 U.S. Telephone Herald stock certificate.JPEG|300px|thumb|right|United States Telephone Herald Company stock certificate (1910).<ref>Twenty-five $10 shares, issued on November 30, 1910 to John J. Griffin. Signed by James Gillies (treasurer) and Manley M. Gillam (president).</ref>]]\n\nThe United States Telephone Herald Company was an authorized offshoot of the [[Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3]] audio service of Budapest, Hungary. The Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3 programming, transmitted to subscribers over telephone wires, consisted of an extensive selection of news during the day, followed by instruction and entertainment during the evening. This \"news-teller\" service began operation in February 1893, shortly before the death of its inventor, [[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]].\n\nFollowing a visit to Hungary, Cornelius Balassa procured the U.S. patent rights to the Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3 technology. (Later reports state that the company also held the rights for Canada and Great Britain. Another group obtained the rights for Italy, where in 1910 they established the service under the name [[Araldo Telefonico]]). The formation of a parent U.S. company, initially operating under a New York state charter as the \"Telephone Newspaper Company of America\", was announced in October 1909, with organizing directors Manley M. Gillam (president), William H. Alexander (secretary and treasurer), and Cornelius Balassa, all of New York City.<ref>[https://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909%20-%209549.pdf\" Hark! Telephone Will Tell it All\"], ''New York Herald,'' October 7, 1909, page 9 (fultonhistory.com)</ref> In March 1910, the parent company was reorganized as the \"United States Telephone Herald Company\", now operating as a Delaware-chartered corporation.<ref>[https://www.bizapedia.com/us/united-states-telephone-herald-company.html United States Telephone Herald Company] entry. (bizapedia.com)</ref>\n\nAn initial demonstration transmission was given at the company headquarters, located at 110 West Thirty-fourth Street in New York City, in early September 1910.<ref>\"News Bulletins by 'Phone\", ''New York Times'', September 9, 1910, page 3.</ref> The equipment used was similar to that which was employed in Budapest. As in Hungary, announcers were called \"[[stentor]]s\", and because [[vacuum tube]] technology had not been developed yet, there were limited methods for amplification, so to compensate the stentors had to speak as loudly as possible into oversized dual-microphones. The lack of amplification also meant that subscribers needed to listen through headphones instead of loudspeakers. On February 14, 1911 {{US patent|src=uspto|984235}}, describing \"a telephone system... adapted for supplying innumerable subscribers... general news, musical compositions, and operas, sermons, correct or standard time and other happenings at stated intervals of day and night\" was granted to \u00c1rp\u00e1d N\u00e9meth, and assigned to the company.\n\nRegionally-based Telephone Herald affiliates were authorized for the purpose of creating local \"telephone newspaper\" systems, with \"the parent company to receive a royalty on every instrument installed\".<ref name=\"short\">[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w&view=1up&seq=200\" 'Phone Herald's Short Life\"], ''The Fourth Estate'', March 2, 1912, pages 10, 23.</ref> But ultimately the parent company and its affiliates proved financially unsuccessful, and the United States Telephone Herald Company began winding down operations. Its Delaware business charter was repealed on January 28, 1918, for failure to pay state corporate taxes for two years.<ref>''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 1263.</ref>\n\n===Telephone Herald associate companies===\n\nAt least twelve Telephone Herald associate companies were formed, although in only two cases was a telephone newspaper service successfully launched: the New Jersey Telephone Herald (1911-1912) and the Oregon Telephone Herald (1912-1913). (In some cases the service was also referred to as the \"telectrophone\".)\n\nEach associate company was established by local owners operating under a state-granted business charter. Publicity for these services commonly stated that the telephone newspaper subscriptions would cost 5 cents a day. (For comparison, at this time a copy of the daily ''Oregonian'' newspaper in Portland also cost 5 cents.) However, a majority of the associate companies got no further than the promotion or demonstration stages.\n\nIn addition to twelve known associate companies, early company publicity stated that installations would also be set up in Chicago,<ref>\"Newspaper By Phone for Chicago\", ''Meriden (Connecticut) Morning Record'', June 15, 1910, page 9.</ref> Scranton, Pennsylvania <ref>\"No Private Wires on News Telephone\", ''Scranton (Pennsylvania) Republican'', September 29, 1910, page 2.</ref> and Montreal, Canada,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IhgqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_oQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C1088591 \"News and Opera Over Telephone\"], ''Montreal Gazette'', January 12, 1911, page 1.</ref> but systems do not appear to have been established at any of these locations. Also, a December 14, 1912 advertisement for the Central California Telephone Herald listed associate Telephone Herald companies with company names starting with New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Seattle-Tacoma, Columbia (British Columbia and Alberta, Canada), Los Angeles and Oakland,<ref name=missing>\"Central California Telephone Herald\" (advertisement), ''Sacramento Bee'', December 14, 1912, page 15.</ref> but there is no information for these either.\n\n==Associate companies that launched telephone newspapers==\n\n===New Jersey Telephone Herald Co.

Colton, ''Technical World'', February 1912, pages 666-669. Pictured stentor appears to be Richard D. Arons.</ref>]]\n\nOf the two Telephone Herald affiliates which launched commercial services, the '''New Jersey Telephone Herald''' was both the first and most publicized. The company had been incorporated in October 1910 in the state of New Jersey by Eugene Gorenflo, Duncan McIsaac and Nicholas J. Surgess.\n\nThe original plan was to begin operations in March 1911, however, the New York Telephone Company, which operated the Newark telephone system franchise, initially refused to lease telephone lines to the Telephone Herald, on the grounds that their charter did not permit it. It required a ruling by the Public Utility Commission to compel the telephone company to provide the needed wires.<ref name=\"short\" /> The hiring process for the stentors, who worked as the news readers, was competitive and rigorous. According to one of the original stentors, the position was restricted to \"college men\" with strong voices and extensive vocabularies. Throughout the day four stentors announced during rotating shifts of 15 minutes each, and did staff work when they were not announcing.<ref>\"America's First Announcer Hailed From Springfield\" by Richard D. Arons, ''Springfield (Massachusetts) Sunday Union and Republican'', February 12, 1928, page 34.</ref>\n\nOn October 24, 1911, an ambitious daily service, closely patterned after the Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3's, was launched to a reported fifty receivers located in a department store waiting room, plus five hundred Newark homes. The company's central offices, studio, and switch rooms were located in the Essex Building on Clinton Street in Newark. Condit S. Atkinson, who had extensive newspaper experience, headed the service's news department.<ref>\"Editor Atkinson Gets Out First Issue of News by Wire\", ''New Brunswick (New Jersey) Times'', October 25, 1911, page 6.</ref>\n\nThe company reported that there were many persons eager to sign up with the innovative service, and it soon had more potential subscribers than could be supported. One young listener later remembered that \"it was a great thrill to pick up the small receiver and hear a voice telling about world events\", moreover, \"It was such a novelty that I could scarcely wait to get home from school and listen to it. It fascinated me. I would listen as long as it was operative, or until I was called to do my homework.\"<ref>''My Father Was Uncle Wiggily'' by Roger Garis, 1966, page 90.</ref> One of the program features was a series of original \"Trippertrot\" stories, written by local children's author [[Howard R. Garis]], which were later assembled into two book collections: ''Three Little Trippertrots'' and ''Three Little Trippertrots on Their Travels'', published in 1912.\n \t\nDespite the enthusiastic response, the company soon ran into serious technical and financial difficulties. Due to a revenue crisis, which resulted in employees walking off the job due to missed paychecks, the service was suspended in late February 1912.<ref name=\"short\" /> A replenishment of funding resulted in a temporary revival in late May, with the primary company officials now consisting of Percy Pyne (president), William E. Gunn (vice-president and general manager), and C. E. Danforth (secretary-treasurer), with C. S. Atkinson renewing his editor functions.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w&view=1up&seq=527 \"The Newark Telephone Herald Resumes\"], ''The Fourth Estate'', June 1, 1912, page 19.</ref> However, this would only be a temporary respite, and the telephone newspaper transmissions shut down for good in December 1912.\n\nA later review suggested that the primary issue was technical, as the twisted pair phone lines used for the Newark operation had different electrical characteristics than the wiring used by the original Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3 plant.<ref>\"Broadcasting in 1912\" by G.

But like its predecessor, it also soon faced financial difficulties and was short-lived.

Grosvenor, Jr. (treasurer), and Jesse W. Morton. De Doory was also a promoter with the parent company. However, the syndicate does not appear to have made any demonstrations or other significant development, and its business charter was dissolved on February 21, 1916.\n\n===California Telephone Herald Co. (San Francisco)===\n\nThis was the first of two companies that were headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company received a California business charter in February 1911, issued to G. S. Holbrook, W. A. Whelan, W. B. Heckmann, A. H. Vorrath, R. M. Graham, R. Boreman, William T. Newverth, A. C. Gould and A. Jacoby.\n\nDemonstrations were conducted in September 1911 at 821, 822, 823 Head Building, but no further progress appears to have been made, and the company charter was declared forfeited and repealed for non-payment of taxes in February 1915.<ref>''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 316.</ref>\n\n===Central California Telephone Herald Co.

(Oakland, California)===\n\nThe company was incorporated in California. Demonstrations were made at H. C. Capwell Company's Store beginning in February 1913 which lasted through at least April. The original corporate offices were at 303-304-305 Union Savings Bank Building in Oakland, prior to a relocation to 1741 Franklin Street.\n\nThe company's secretary-treasurer, J. B. Whited died in September 1913, and the company president, William Angus, was killed in a mining accident in October 1914. In addition, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company initially refused to lease telephone lines to the company, resulting in a complaint filed before the Railroad Commission of the State of California. This case was dismissed on November 5, 1913 after the two sides reached a settlement.\n\nIn November 1913, a major expansion was announced, with the purchase from the parent company of the rights to operate in twenty-one western U.S. states and \"the greater part of southwestern Canada\",<ref>\"Telephone Herald Co. Acquires Facilities\", ''Oakland Tribune'', November 18, 1913, page 18.</ref> and the next month saw a merger with the Central California Telephone Herald Company of Sacramento.<ref name=\"merger\" /> But despite the ambitious expansion plans, it does not appear that any regular service was ever established, and the state business charter was forfeited on March 4, 1916 for failure to pay the state license tax.<ref>''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. II'' (1928), page 1077.</ref>\n\n===Pennsylvania Telephone Herald Co.

It was incorporated in the state of California on October 29, 1912, with founding the directors of W. H. Dohrmann, J. F. Dohrmann, A. J. Beecher, F. W. Beecher, Thomas R. White, C. E. Youngblood, Rudolph Schlueten, Clarence Eppstein and E. L. Manner.\n\nDemonstrations were given at 687 Market Street in early January 1913, but no further progress appears to have been made.

However, these efforts were no more successful than the Telephone Herald companies.\n\nBoth the Hungarian [[Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3]] and the Italian [[Araldo Telefonico]] survived long enough for their operations to be combined with radio broadcasting in the 1920s. The same did not occur in the United States, and the Telephone Herald companies were the last early effort to offer nationwide audio programming over telephone lines. Although the concept of home audio entertainment was attractive to potential U.S. subscribers, the lack of signal amplification and other technical limitations, such as the need to maintain a telephone line infrastructure, and having to listen over headphones, made the technology unprofitable.<ref>\"Early Uses of the Telephone\" by Carolyn Marvin, ''Communication in History'', 1995, page 179.</ref>\n\nLess than a decade after the failure of the Telephone Herald companies, radio broadcasting was developed, which had the significant advantage that it could dispense with the need to use telephone lines. Moreover, radio programming could be provided free of subscription fees, because selling airtime to advertisers, the financing method most commonly adopted in the United States, provided sufficient revenue for ongoing operations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Telephone newspapers]]\n[[Category:Information by telephone]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications systems]]\n[[Category:Telephony]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1909]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 1918]]\n[[Category:Holding companies established in 1909]]\n[[Category:1909 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1918 disestablishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Holding companies disestablished in the 20th century]]\n", "text_old": "The '''United States Telephone Herald Company''', founded in 1909, was the parent corporation for a number of associated \"[[telephone newspaper]]\" companies, located throughout the United States, that were organized to provide news and entertainment over telephone lines to subscribing homes and businesses. This was the most ambitious attempt made to develop a distributed audio service prior to the rise of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.\n\nAt least a dozen associate companies were chartered, but despite initial optimism and ambitious goals, only two systems ever went into commercial operation \u2014 one based in Newark, New Jersey (New Jersey Telephone Herald, 1911-1912) and the other in Portland, Oregon (Oregon Telephone Herald, 1912-1913). Moreover, both of these systems were shut down after operating for only a short time, due to economic and technical issues.\n\nCorporation activity peaked in 1913, but the lack of success caused the company to suspend operations, and the corporation charter for the United States Telephone Herald Company was repealed in early 1918.\n\n==Company history==\n\n[[File:1910 U.S. Telephone Herald stock certificate.JPEG|300px|thumb|right|United States Telephone Herald Company stock certificate (1910).<ref>Twenty-five $10 shares, issued on November 30, 1910 to John J.

The Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3 programming, transmitted to subscribers over telephone wires, consisted of an extensive selection of news during the day, followed by instruction and entertainment during the evening. This \"news-teller\" service began operation in February 1893, shortly before the death of its inventor, [[Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s]].\n\nFollowing a visit to Hungary, Cornelius Balassa procured the U.S. patent rights to the Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3 technology. (Later reports state that the company also held the rights for Canada and Great Britain. Another group obtained the rights for Italy, where in 1910 they established the service under the name [[Araldo Telefonico]]). The formation of a parent U.S. company, initially operating under a New York state charter as the \"Telephone Newspaper Company of America\", was announced in October 1909, with organizing directors Manley M. Gillam (president), William H. Alexander (secretary and treasurer), and Cornelius Balassa, all of New York City.<ref>[https://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909%20-%209549.pdf\" Hark!

As in Hungary, announcers were called \"[[stentor]]s\", and because [[vacuum tube]] technology had not been developed yet, there were limited methods for amplification, so to compensate the stentors had to speak as loudly as possible into oversized dual-microphones. The lack of amplification also meant that subscribers needed to listen through headphones instead of loudspeakers. On February 14, 1911 {{US patent|src=uspto|984235}}, describing \"a telephone system... adapted for supplying innumerable subscribers... general news, musical compositions, and operas, sermons, correct or standard time and other happenings at stated intervals of day and night\" was granted to \u00c1rp\u00e1d N\u00e9meth, and assigned to the company.\n\nRegionally-based Telephone Herald affiliates were authorized for the purpose of creating local \"telephone newspaper\" systems, with \"the parent company to receive a royalty on every instrument installed\".<ref name=\"short\">[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w&view=1up&seq=200\" 'Phone Herald's Short Life\"], ''The Fourth Estate'', March 2, 1912, pages 10, 23.</ref> But ultimately the parent company and its affiliates proved financially unsuccessful, and the United States Telephone Herald Company began winding down operations. Its Delaware business charter was repealed on January 28, 1918, for failure to pay state corporate taxes for two years.<ref>''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 1263.</ref>\n\n===Telephone Herald associate companies===\n\nAt least twelve Telephone Herald associate companies were formed, although in only two cases was a telephone newspaper service successfully launched: the New Jersey Telephone Herald (1911-1912) and the Oregon Telephone Herald (1912-1913). (In some cases the service was also referred to as the \"telectrophone\".)\n\nEach associate company was established by local owners operating under a state-granted business charter. Publicity for these services commonly stated that the telephone newspaper subscriptions would cost 5 cents a day. (For comparison, at this time a copy of the daily ''Oregonian'' newspaper in Portland also cost 5 cents.) However, a majority of the associate companies got no further than the promotion or demonstration stages.\n\nIn addition to twelve known associate companies, early company publicity stated that installations would also be set up in Chicago,<ref>\"Newspaper By Phone for Chicago\", ''Meriden (Connecticut) Morning Record'', June 15, 1910, page 9.</ref> Scranton, Pennsylvania <ref>\"No Private Wires on News Telephone\", ''Scranton (Pennsylvania) Republican'', September 29, 1910, page 2.</ref> and Montreal, Canada,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IhgqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_oQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C1088591 \"News and Opera Over Telephone\"], ''Montreal Gazette'', January 12, 1911, page 1.</ref> but systems do not appear to have been established at any of these locations. Also, a December 14, 1912 advertisement for the Central California Telephone Herald listed associate Telephone Herald companies with company names starting with New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Seattle-Tacoma, Columbia (British Columbia and Alberta, Canada), Los Angeles and Oakland,<ref name=missing>\"Central California Telephone Herald\" (advertisement), ''Sacramento Bee'', December 14, 1912, page 15.</ref> but there is no information for these either.\n\n==Associate companies that launched telephone newspapers==\n\n===New Jersey Telephone Herald Co.

Colton, ''Technical World'', February 1912, pages 666-669. Pictured stentor appears to be Richard D. Arons.</ref>]]\n\nOf the two Telephone Herald affiliates which launched commercial services, the '''New Jersey Telephone Herald''' was both the first and most publicized. The company had been incorporated in October 1910 in the state of New Jersey by Eugene Gorenflo, Duncan McIsaac and Nicholas J. Surgess.\n\nThe original plan was to begin operations in March 1911, however, the New York Telephone Company, which operated the Newark telephone system franchise, initially refused to lease telephone lines to the Telephone Herald, on the grounds that their charter did not permit it. It required a ruling by the Public Utility Commission to compel the telephone company to provide the needed wires.<ref name=\"short\" /> The hiring process for the stentors, who worked as the news readers, was competitive and rigorous. According to one of the original stentors, the position was restricted to \"college men\" with strong voices and extensive vocabularies. Throughout the day four stentors announced during rotating shifts of 15 minutes each, and did staff work when they were not announcing.<ref>\"America's First Announcer Hailed From Springfield\" by Richard D. Arons, ''Springfield (Massachusetts) Sunday Union and Republican'', February 12, 1928, page 34.</ref>\n\nOn October 24, 1911, an ambitious daily service, closely patterned after the Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3's, was launched to a reported fifty receivers located in a department store waiting room, plus five hundred Newark homes. The company's central offices, studio, and switch rooms were located in the Essex Building on Clinton Street in Newark. Condit S. Atkinson, who had extensive newspaper experience, headed the service's news department.<ref>\"Editor Atkinson Gets Out First Issue of News by Wire\", ''New Brunswick (New Jersey) Times'', October 25, 1911, page 6.</ref>\n\nThe company reported that there were many persons eager to sign up with the innovative service, and it soon had more potential subscribers than could be supported. One young listener later remembered that \"it was a great thrill to pick up the small receiver and hear a voice telling about world events\", moreover, \"It was such a novelty that I could scarcely wait to get home from school and listen to it. It fascinated me. I would listen as long as it was operative, or until I was called to do my homework.\"<ref>''My Father Was Uncle Wiggily'' by Roger Garis, 1966, page 90.</ref> One of the program features was a series of original \"Trippertrot\" stories, written by local children's author [[Howard R. Garis]], which were later assembled into two book collections: ''Three Little Trippertrots'' and ''Three Little Trippertrots on Their Travels'', published in 1912.\n \t\nDespite the enthusiastic response, the company soon ran into serious technical and financial difficulties.

Grosvenor, Jr. (treasurer), and Jesse W. Morton. De Doory was also a promoter with the parent company. However, the syndicate does not appear to have made any demonstrations or other significant development, and its business charter was dissolved on February 21, 1916.\n\n===California Telephone Herald Co. (San Francisco)===\n\nThis was the first of two companies that were headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company received a California business charter in February 1911, issued to G. S. Holbrook, W. A. Whelan, W. B. Heckmann, A. H. Vorrath, R. M. Graham, R. Boreman, William T. Newverth, A. C. Gould and A. Jacoby.\n\nDemonstrations were conducted in September 1911 at 821, 822, 823 Head Building, but no further progress appears to have been made, and the company charter was declared forfeited and repealed for non-payment of taxes in February 1915.<ref>''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 316.</ref>\n\n===Central California Telephone Herald Co. (Sacramento)===\n\nIncorporated in California in February 1912 by C. J. Ward, F. W. Bresse and S. H. Whisner.

(Oakland, California)===\n\nThe company was incorporated in California. Demonstrations were made at H. C. Capwell Company's Store beginning in February 1913 which lasted through at least April. The original corporate offices were at 303-304-305 Union Savings Bank Building in Oakland, prior to a relocation to 1741 Franklin Street.\n\nThe company's secretary-treasurer, J. B. Whited died in September 1913, and the company president, William Angus, was killed in a mining accident in October 1914. In addition, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company initially refused to lease telephone lines to the company, resulting in a complaint filed before the Railroad Commission of the State of California. This case was dismissed on November 5, 1913 after the two sides reached a settlement.\n\nIn November 1913, a major expansion was announced, with the purchase from the parent company of the rights to operate in twenty-one western U.S. states and \"the greater part of southwestern Canada\",<ref>\"Telephone Herald Co. Acquires Facilities\", ''Oakland Tribune'', November 18, 1913, page 18.</ref> and the next month saw a merger with the Central California Telephone Herald Company of Sacramento.<ref name=\"merger\" /> But despite the ambitious expansion plans, it does not appear that any regular service was ever established, and the state business charter was forfeited on March 4, 1916 for failure to pay the state license tax.<ref>''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. II'' (1928), page 1077.</ref>\n\n===Pennsylvania Telephone Herald Co.

It was incorporated in the state of California on October 29, 1912, with founding the directors of W. H. Dohrmann, J. F. Dohrmann, A. J. Beecher, F. W. Beecher, Thomas R. White, C. E. Youngblood, Rudolph Schlueten, Clarence Eppstein and E. L. Manner.\n\nDemonstrations were given at 687 Market Street in early January 1913, but no further progress appears to have been made.

However, these efforts were no more successful than the Telephone Herald companies.\n\nBoth the Hungarian [[Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3]] and the Italian [[Araldo Telefonico]] survived long enough for their operations to be combined with radio broadcasting in the 1920s. The same did not occur in the United States, and the Telephone Herald companies were the last early effort to offer nationwide audio programming over telephone lines. Although the concept of home audio entertainment was attractive to potential U.S. subscribers, the lack of signal amplification and other technical limitations, such as the need to maintain a telephone line infrastructure, and having to listen over headphones, made the technology unprofitable.<ref>\"Early Uses of the Telephone\" by Carolyn Marvin, ''Communication in History'', 1995, page 179.</ref>\n\nLess than a decade after the failure of the Telephone Herald companies, radio broadcasting was developed, which had the significant advantage that it could dispense with the need to use telephone lines. Moreover, radio programming could be provided free of subscription fees, because selling airtime to advertisers, the financing method most commonly adopted in the United States, provided sufficient revenue for ongoing operations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Telephone newspapers]]\n[[Category:Information by telephone]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications systems]]\n[[Category:Telephony]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1909]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 1918]]\n[[Category:Holding companies established in 1909]]\n[[Category:1909 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1918 disestablishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Holding companies disestablished in the 20th century]]\n", "name_user": "Thomas H.
