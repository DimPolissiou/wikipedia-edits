Led by [[Drexel University]], the members of the scientific team are from  [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[Argonne National Laboratory]], [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] and [[Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy]]. The primary fields of research are applications in [[#Plasma Medicine|medicine]], [[#Plasma Aided Environmental Control|Environmental Control]], [[#Plasma in the Field of Energy|energy]], and [[#Plasma in the Field of Agriculture|agricultural]] industries. The institute actively develops and researches specific types of plasma discharges such as gliding arc, [[dielectric barrier discharge]], gliding arc tornado, reverse vortex flow, Pulsed Corona Discharge, and many more.\n\n== Applications ==\nMany applications of plasma can be utilized in many industries. As such, its application is often categorized in the context of its research. For example, the dissociation of [[hydrogen sulfide]] can be labeled as an environmental application. However, its production of gaseous hydrogen can be more relevant to the energy industry. As such, it is categorized on its researched application, rather than its objective goal.\n\n=== Medicine ===\n\nDr. Gregory Fridman is the laboratory director regarding the application of plasma in the field of medicine.  Along with teaching at [[Drexel University]], he creates and finds new applications of plasma in medicine such as [[blood coagulation]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kalghatgi, S.U.|author2= Fridman, G.|author3= Cooper, M.|author4= Nagaraj, G.|author5= Peddinghaus, M.|author6= Balasubramanian, M.|author7= Vasilets, V.N.|author8= Gutsol, A.F.|author9= Fridman, A.|author10= Friedman, G.|title=Mechanism of Blood Coagulation by Nonthermal Atmospheric Pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|date=Oct 2007|volume=35|issue=5|pages=1559\u20131566|issn=0093-3813|doi=10.1109/tps.2007.905953|bibcode=2007ITPS...35.1559K}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental control ===\n\n=== Energy ===\nAlexander Rabinovich is the laboratory director regarding the application of plasma in the field of energy.
