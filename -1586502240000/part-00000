{"title_page": "Grammatical number", "text_new": "{{Citation style|date=January 2014}}\n{{Grammatical categories}}\n\nIn linguistics, '''grammatical number''' is a [[grammatical category]] of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] that expresses count distinctions (such as \"one\", \"two\", or \"three or more\").<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsNumber.htm | publisher = SIL | title = Dictionary of Linguistic Terms | contribution = What is Number?}}.</ref> English and other languages present number categories of singular or [[plural]], both of which are cited by using the [[hash sign]] (#) or by the [[numero sign]]s \"No.\" and \"Nos.\" respectively. Some languages also have a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[Grammatical number#Trial|trial]], and [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]] number or other arrangements.\n\nThe count distinctions typically, but not always, correspond to the actual count of the [[referent]]s of the [[marker (linguistics)|marked]] noun or pronoun.\n\nThe word \"number\" is also used in linguistics to describe the distinction between certain grammatical aspects that indicate the number of times an event occurs, such as the [[semelfactive]] aspect, the iterative aspect, etc. For that use of the term, see \"[[Grammatical aspect]]\".\n\n==Overview==\nMost languages of the world have formal means to express differences of number. One widespread distinction, found in English and many other languages, involves a simple two-way number contrast between singular and plural (''car''/''cars'', ''child''/''children'', etc.). Discussion of other more elaborate systems of number appears below.\n\nGrammatical number is a morphological category characterized by the expression of [[quantity]] through inflection or agreement. As an example, consider the English sentences below:\n: ''That apple on the table is fresh.''\n: ''Those two apples on the table are fresh.''\nThe number of apples is marked on the noun\u2014\"apple\" '''singular number''' (one item) vs. \"apples\" '''plural number''' (more than one item)\u2014on the demonstrative, \"that/those\", and on the verb, \"is/are\". In the second sentence, all this information is [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]], since quantity is already indicated by the numeral \"two\".\n\nA language has grammatical number when its nouns are subdivided into [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological classes]] according to the quantity they express, such that:\n#Every [[noun]] belongs to a unique number class (nouns are partitioned into disjoint classes by number).\n#Noun [[modifier (linguistics)|modifiers]] (such as adjectives) and [[verb]]s may also have different forms for each number class and be [[inflection|inflected]] to match the number of the nouns to which they refer (number is an [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement category]]).\n\nThis is partly the case in English: every noun is either singular or plural (a few forms, such as \"fish\", can be either, according to context), and at least some modifiers of nouns\u2014namely the [[demonstrative]]s, the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]], the [[article (grammar)|articles]], and [[verb]]s\u2014are inflected to agree with the number of the nouns to which they refer: \"this car\" and \"these cars\" are correct, while \"*this cars\" or \"*these car\" are ungrammatical and, therefore, incorrect. However, adjectives are not inflected, and some verb forms do not distinguish between singular and plural (\"She/They went\", \"She/They can go\", \"She/They had gone\", \"She/They will go\"). Only count nouns can be freely used in the singular and in the plural. Mass nouns, like \"milk\", \"silverware\", and \"wisdom\", are normally used in only the singular form.<ref>{{Citation | last = Nicolas | first = David | year = 2008 | title = Mass nouns and plural logic | journal = Linguistics and Philosophy | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 211\u201344 | url = http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf | doi = 10.1007/s10988-008-9033-2 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219021719/http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf | archivedate = 2012-02-19 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.510.3305 }}.</ref> (In some cases, a normally mass noun '''''X''''' may be used as a count noun to collect several distinct kinds of '''''X''''' into an enumerable group; for example, a cheesemaker might speak of goat, sheep, and cow milk as ''milks''.) Many languages distinguish between count nouns and mass nouns.\n\nNot all languages have number as a grammatical category. In those that do not, quantity must be expressed either directly, with [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, or indirectly, through optional [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s. However, many of these languages compensate{{clarify|date=February 2015}} for the lack of grammatical number with an extensive system of [[measure word]]s.\n\nThere is a hierarchy among number categories: no language distinguishes a trial (indicating the number 3) unless it has a dual, and no language has a dual without a plural.{{Sfn | Greenberg | 1972}}\n\n==Geographical distribution==\nObligatory plural marking of all nouns is found throughout [[Eurasiatic languages|western and northern Eurasia]] and in [[Languages of Africa|most parts of Africa]]. The rest of the world presents a heterogeneous picture. Optional plural marking is particularly common in [[East Asian languages|Southeast and East Asia]] and [[Australian languages]], and complete lack of plural marking is particularly found in [[Papuan languages|New Guinea]] and Australian languages. In addition to the [[Areal feature|areal correlations]], there also seems to be at least one correlation with [[morphological typology]]: [[isolating languages]] appear to favor no or non-obligatory plural marking. This can be seen particularly in Africa, where optionality or absence of plural marking is found particularly in the isolating languages of West Africa.<ref>{{Citation | last = Good | first = JC | title = Kwa noun | url = http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcgood/jcgood-KwaNoun.pdf | publisher = Buffalo }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | chapter-url = http://wals.info/chapter/34 | title = Occurrence of Nominal Plurality | publisher = Wals | chapter = 34}}</ref>\n\n== Number in specific languages ==\n\n===English===\n{{Main |English plural}}\n[[English language|English]] is typical of most world languages, in distinguishing only between singular and plural number. The plural form of a noun is usually created by adding the [[suffix]] ''-(e)s''. The pronouns have irregular plurals, as in \"I\" versus \"we\", because they are ancient and frequently used words going back to when English had a well developed system of [[declension]]. English verbs distinguish singular from plural number in the third person present tense (\"He goes\" versus \"They go\"). English treats zero with the plural number. [[Old English]] also contained dual grammatical numbers.\n\n===Finnish===\n{{Further |Finnish grammar#Plurals}}\nThe [[Finnish language]] has a plural form of almost every noun case (except the comitative, which is formally only plural).\n* ''talo'' \u2013 house\n* ''talot'' \u2013 houses\n* ''taloissa'' \u2013 in the houses\n\nHowever, when a number is used, or a word signifying a number (monta- many), the singular version of the partitive case is used.\n* ''kolme taloa'' \u2013 three houses\n\nand where no specific number is mentioned, the plural version of the partitive case is used\n* taloja\n\nand in the possessive (genitive)\n* talon ovi (the house's door)\n* talojen ovet (the houses' doors)\n\n===French===\nIn modern Romance languages, nouns, adjectives and articles are declined according to number (singular or plural only). Verbs are conjugated for number as well as person. French treats zero as using the singular number, not the plural.\n\nIn its written form, [[French language|French]] declines nouns for number (singular or plural). In speech, however, the majority of nouns (and adjectives) are not declined for number. The typical plural suffix, ''-s'' or ''-es'', is [[silent letter|silent]], no longer indicating a change in pronunciation. Spoken number marking on the noun appears when [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] occurs.\n* some plurals do differ from the singular in pronunciation; for example, masculine singulars in ''-al'' {{IPA|[al]}} sometimes form masculine plurals in ''-aux'' {{IPA|[o]}}.\n* [[Proper nouns]] are not pluralized, even in writing. (''Les voitures'', but ''Les [[Peugeot 404]]'')\n\nNormally, the article or determiner is the primary spoken indicator of number.\n\n===Hebrew===\nIn Modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a [[Semitic language]], most nouns have only singular and plural forms, such as \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 {{IPA |/\u02c8sefe\u0281/}} \"book\" and \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/sfa\u02c8\u0281im/}} \"books\", but some have distinct dual forms using a distinct dual suffix (largely nouns pertaining to numbers or time, such as \u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/al\u02c8pajim/}} \"two thousand\" and \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/\u0283vu\u02c8ajim/}} \"two weeks\"), some use this dual suffix for their regular plurals (largely body parts that tend to come in pairs, such as \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/ei\u02c8najim/}} \"eyes\", as well as some that do not, such as \u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/\u0283i\u02c8najim/}} \"teeth\"), and some are inherently dual (such as \u05de\u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA |/mixna\u02c8sajim/}} \"pants\" and \u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/ofa\u02c8najim/}} \"bicycle\"). Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns agree with their subjects' or antecedents' numbers, but only have a two-way distinction between singular and plural; dual nouns entail plural adjectives, verbs, and pronouns.\n\n===Russian===\n{{main|Russian declension#Numerals}}\n\nModern [[Russian language|Russian]] has a singular vs plural number system, but the [[declension]] of noun phrases containing numeral expressions follows complex rules. For example, \"\u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430/\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438/\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\" (\"I have one book-''nom. sing.''/three book-''gen. sing.''/five book-''gen. plur.''\"). See [[Dual (grammatical number)#Slavic languages|Dual number: Slavic languages]] for a discussion of number phrases in Russian and other Slavic languages.\n\nThe numeral \"one\" also has a plural form, used with [[pluralia tantum]]: \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044b/\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u044b \"one pair of jeans, one clock\".{{Sfn | Lunt | 1982 | p = 204}} The same form is used with countable nouns in meaning \"only\": \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0442\u044b \"There are only idiots around\".\n\n===Swedish===\n[[Swedish language|Swedish]] inflects nouns in singular and plural. The plural of the noun is usually obtained by adding a suffix, according to the noun's declension. The suffixes are as follows: -or in the 1st declension (e.g. flicka \u2013 flickor), -ar in the 2nd (e.g. bil \u2013 bilar), -er in the 3rd (e.g. katt \u2013 katter), -n in the 4th (e.g. \u00e4pple \u2013 \u00e4pplen) and no inflectional suffix is added for the nouns in the 5th declension (e.g. bord \u2013 bord). Verbs in Swedish do not distinguish singular from plural number, but adjectives do.\n\n=== Tokelauan ===\n[[Tokelau]] is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] Island consisting of three atolls. The [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]] language has three types of personal pronouns \u2013 1st person, 2nd person inclusive, 2nd person exclusive, and 3rd person exclusive. The language has unique ways to address multiple people in one conversation. For example, the generic greeting for \u2018Hello\u2019 is T\u0101lofa or M\u0101l\u014d. To greet one person, \u2018greetings to you\u2019 would be the same as the common greeting. To address two people, T\u0101lofa n\u012b/M\u0101l\u014d n\u012b Fakat\u0101lofa atu kia te koulua; koulua is the dual third person term. To address three or more people, Fakat\u0101lofa atu kia te koutou; koutou is the plural third person term.<ref>Hooper, Robin (1996). ''Tokelauan''. Munched, Germany: Lincom Europa. p. 1, 3. {{ISBN|3-929075-41-5}}.</ref>\n\n===Wuvulu-Aua===\n[[Wuvulu language|Wuvulu]] is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] Island located in the [[Manus Province]] of Papua New Guinea. The languages numbering system is multiplicative construction, where each number is based on multiplying pre-existing numbers smaller than five. Wuvulu is most similar to most [[Oceanic language]]s, and their numbering system is representative of some systems found in the Marshall Islands. For examples, the number two in Wuvulu is ''roa'' and the number four in both Proto-Oceanic language and Wuvulu is ''fa''. Therefore, the number eight in Wuvulu the construction of two and four, resulting in ''fainaroa'', translating into \"four multiply two\". Moreover, the Wuvulu language has different numerical systems for animate objects and inanimate objects. When referencing an inanimate object, the number seven is ''oloompalo''; however, if it is an animate object, the word changes to ''oloromea''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrod|first1=James|title=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|date=2014|page=73|url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JamesHaffordDraft.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> The structure of a noun phrase looks like \" NP=(ART/DEMONSTRATIVE+)(NUMBER/QUANTIFIER+)(PREMODIFIERS+)NOUN(+MODIFER.)

Pronouns, nouns and demonstratives are used exclusively in the singular and plural forms through the use of classifiers, suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people, Eastern Carolines, Trust Territory of Micronesia|last=Ward|first=William Theophilus Thomas|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> There are no other dual or trial grammatical forms in the Mortlockese language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Odango|first1=Emerson Lopez|title=Aff\u00e9\u00fa Fangani 'Join Together': A Morphophonemic Analysis of Possessive Suffix Paradigms and A Discourse-Based Ethnography of the Elicitation Session in Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese|date=May 2015|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa Dissertation|url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Dissertation_ODANGO-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> Different forms that can be used in the language include first person singular and plural words, second person singular words like \u201cumwi,\u201d second person plural words like \u201caumi\u201d used to refer to an outside group, and third person plural words.<ref>{{cite web|author=University of Hawaii at Manoa Hamilton|title=Narrative and identity construction in the Pacific Islands|url=http://reader.eblib.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/(S(bfec0qwyennsyhjjyoy3lxhr))/Reader.aspx?p=2040187&o=376&u=0GOyKO0ekzLvKJLaSEvKuw%3d%3d&t=1486402464&h=5B6C7F87B4062AECBD899D5821D51EF7A00B310D&s=53250598&ut=1139&pg=1&r=img&c=-1&pat=n&cms=-1&sd=2#|website=reader.eblib.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu|publisher=Philadelphia, PA : John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2015.}}</ref>\n\n==Types of number==\n\n===Singular versus plural===\n{{Main |Plural}}\nIn most languages with grammatical number, nouns, and sometimes other parts of speech, have two forms, the singular, for one instance of a concept, and the plural, for more than one instance. Usually, the singular is the [[marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] form of a word, and the plural is obtained by [[inflection|inflecting]] the singular. This is the case in English: ''car/cars, box/boxes, man/men''. There may be exceptional nouns whose plural is identical to the singular: ''one sheep/two sheep'' (which is not the same as nouns that have only one number).\n\n===Singulative versus collective===\n{{Main |Singulative number}}\nSome languages differentiate between an [[Null morpheme|unmarked]] form, the collective, which is indifferent in respect to number, and a marked form for single entities, called the singulative in this context. For example, in Welsh, ''moch'' (\"pigs\") is a basic form, whereas a suffix is added to form ''mochyn'' (\"pig\"). It is the collective form which is more basic, and it is used as an adjectival modifier, e.g. ''cig moch'' (\"pig meat\", \"pork\"). The collective form is therefore similar in many respects to an English mass noun like \"rice\", which in fact refers to a collection of items which are logically countable. However, English has no [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process of forming singulative nouns (just phrases such as \"a grain of rice\"). Therefore, English cannot be said to have a singulative number.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn other languages, singulatives can be regularly formed from [[collective noun]]s; e.g. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u062d\u062c\u0631}} ''\u1e25ajar'' \"stone\" \u2192 {{lang|ar|\u062d\u062c\u0631\u0629}} ''\u1e25ajara'' \"(individual) stone\", {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0642\u0631}} ''baqar'' \"cattle\" \u2192 {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0642\u0631\u0629}} ''baqara'' \"(single) cow\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In [[Russian language|Russian]], the suffix for forming singulative form is -\u0438\u043d- ''-in-''; e.g. \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 ''grad'' \"hail\" \u2192 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 ''gradina'' \"hailstone\", \u043b\u0451\u0434 ''lyod'' \"ice\" \u2192 \u043b\u044c\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 ''l'dina'' \"block of ice\". {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In both Russian and Arabic, the singulative form always takes on the feminine [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Dutch, singulative forms of collective nouns are occasionally made by diminutives: ''snoep'' \"sweets, candy\" \u2192 ''snoepje'' \"sweet, piece of candy\". These singulatives can be pluralised like most other nouns: ''snoepjes'' \"several sweets, pieces of candy\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Dual===\n{{Main |Dual (grammatical number)}}\nThe distinction between a \"singular\" number (one) and a \"plural\" number (more than one) found in English is not the only possible classification. Another one is \"singular\" (one), \"dual\" (two) and \"plural\" (more than two). Dual number existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], persisted in many ancient [[Indo-European languages]] that descended from it\u2014[[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Norse]], and [[Old English]] for example\u2014and can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as [[Slovene language|Slovene]].{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 2001 | pp = 63, 72\u201373}} Many more modern Indo-European languages show residual traces of the dual, as in the [[English language|English]] distinctions ''both'' vs. ''all'', ''either'' vs. ''any'', ''neither'' vs. ''none'', and so on. Former dual forms may broaden their meanings: Norwegian ''b\u00e5de'', for example, though cognate with English ''both'', can be used with more than two things, as in ''X sparer b\u00e5de tid, penger, og arbeid'', literally \"X saves both time, money, and labour\".\n\nMany [[Semitic languages]] also have dual number. For instance, in Arabic all nouns can have singular, plural, or dual forms. For non-[[broken plural]]s, masculine plural nouns end with \u0648\u0646 ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-\u016bn}}'' and feminine plural nouns end with \u0627\u062a ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-\u0101t}}'', whilst \u0627\u0646 ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-\u0101n}}'', is added to the end of a noun to indicate that it is dual (even among nouns that have broken plurals).\n\nPronouns in [[Polynesian languages]] such as [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] exhibit the singular, dual, and plural numbers.\n\nThe dual may be restricted to certain morphological categories. For example, in [[North Saami]], in possessive forms the possessor has three numbers (singular, dual, plural) whereas the noun possessed only has two (singular, plural).\n\n===Trial===\nThe trial number is a grammatical number referring to 'three items', in contrast to 'singular' (one item), 'dual' (two items), and 'plural' (four or more items). Several Austronesian languages such as [[Tolomako]], [[Lihir language|Lihir]], and [[Manam language|Manam]]; the [[Kiwaian languages]]; and the Austronesian-influenced creole languages [[Bislama]] and [[Tok Pisin]] have the trial number in their pronouns. No language has been documented to have trial number in its nouns.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010|reason=what source(s) say no language is known with trial number in its nouns?}}\n\n===Quadral===\nThe [[wikt:quadral|quadral]] number, if it existed, would denote [[4 (number)|four]] items together, as trial does three. No known natural language has it, nor is there any proof that any natural language ever did. It was once thought to exist in the pronoun systems of [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], spoken in the [[Marshall Islands]] in the Pacific Ocean,<ref>Gregersen, Edgar A., \"Language in Africa\", p. 62.

While not all of these languages are adequately attested, it turns out that Sursurunga instead has both a \"lesser paucal\" (labeled \"trial\", but in fact referring to small groups, with typically three or four members) and a \"greater paucal\" (misnamed the \"quadral\", as it has a minimum of four, e.g. a pair of [[dyadic kin]] terms)\u2014the distinction is along the lines of \"a few\" vs. \"several\";\u2014and that what Marshallese actually has is a trial and a paucal.{{Sfn | Corbett | 2000 | pp = 25\u201330, 40, 46, 224, 317, 358}} None of them has a \"quadral\"; in at least two cases the field workers who originally suggested they did have a \"quadral\" were also the first to publish a peer-reviewed article contradicting that suggestion.\n\n===Paucal===\nPaucal number, for a few (as opposed to many) instances of the referent (e.g. in [[Hopi language|Hopi]], [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], [[Lower Sepik-Ramu languages]],<ref name=\"Foley-Sepik\">{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |authorlink=William A.

[[Slovene language|Slovene]] has one more distinction. With its use of dual ('one dog' is ''en pes'', 'two dogs' is ''dva psa''), paucal is only used for counting 3 and 4 (''3, 4 psi'' \u2013 dogs, pl.; but ''5+ psov'' \u2013 dogs, gen.pl.).\n\n===Distributive plural===\nDistributive plural number, for many instances viewed as independent individuals (for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]]).\n\n==Formal expression==\n[[Synthetic language]]s typically distinguish grammatical number by [[inflection]]. ([[Analytic language]]s, such as [[Chinese spoken language|Chinese]], often do not mark grammatical number.)\n\nSome languages have no [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] for the plural in certain cases, e.g. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''hus'' \u2013 \"house, houses\" (but ''huset'' \u2013 \"the house\", ''husen'' \u2013 \"the houses\").\n\nIn most languages, the singular is formally unmarked, whereas the plural is marked in some way. Other languages, most notably the [[Bantu languages]], mark both the singular and the plural, for instance [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (see example below). The third logical possibility, found in only a few languages such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], is an unmarked plural contrasting with marked singular. Below are some examples of number [[affix]]es for nouns (where the inflecting [[morpheme]]s are underlined):\n\n* [[Affix]]ation (by adding or removing [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, [[infix]]es, or [[circumfix]]es):\n** [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''puu'' \"tree, wood\" (singular) \u2013 ''puu<u>d</u>'' \"the trees, woods\" (nominative plural), or ''kolm puud'' \"three trees\" ([[Partitive case|partitive]] singular)\n** [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''lehm\u00e4'' \"cow, the cow\" (singular) \u2013 ''lehm\u00e4<u>t</u>'' \"the cows\" ([[nominative]] plural)\n** [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''da\u011f'' \"the mountain\" (singular) \u2013 ''da\u011f<u>lar</u>'' \"mountains\" (plural)\n** [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''{{lang|sl|l\u00edp<u>a</u>}}'' \"linden\" (singular) \u2013 ''{{lang|sl|l\u00edp<u>i</u>}}'' \"linden\" (dual) \u2013 ''{{lang|sl|l\u00edp<u>e</u>}}'' \"linden\" (plural)\n** [[Sanskrit]]: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0938\u094d ''puru\u1e63<u>as</u>'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094c ''puru\u1e63<u>au</u>'' \"two men\" (dual) \u2013 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u093e\u0938\u094d ''puru\u1e63<u>\u0101s</u>'' \"men\" (plural)\n** [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca ''mal<u>ak</u>'' \"flower\" (singular) \u2013 \u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca ''mal'' \"flowers\" (plural)\n** [[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''<u>m</u>toto'' \"child\" (singular) \u2013 ''<u>wa</u>toto'' \"children\" (plural)\n** [[Luganda|Ganda]]: ''<u>omu</u>sajja'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 ''<u>aba</u>sajja'' \"men\" (plural)\n** [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: \u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8 ''k'aci'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 \u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 ''k'ac<u>eb</u>i'' \"men\" (where ''-i'' is the nominative case marker)\n** [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''plant'' \"children\" (collective) \u2013 ''pl<u>e</u>nt<u>yn</u>'' \"child\" (singulative) <small>Care should be taken with Welsh not to confuse ''singulative/collective'' with ''singular/plural'', see [[Colloquial Welsh nouns]].</small>\n* [[Simulfix]] (through various kinds of internal [[Apophony|sound alternations]]):\n** [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628 ''k<u>i</u>t<u>\u0101</u>b'' \"book\" (singular) \u2013 \u0643\u064f\u062a\u064f\u0628 ''k<u>u</u>t<u>u</u>b'' \"books\" (plural)\n* [[Apophony]] (alternating between different vowels):\n** [[Dinka language|Dinka]]: ''k<u>a</u>t'' \"frame\" \u2013 ''k<u>\u025b</u>t'' \"frames\"\n** [[English language|English]]: ''f<u>oo</u>t'' \u2013 ''f<u>ee</u>t''\n** [[German language|German]]: ''M<u>u</u>tter'' \"mother\" \u2013 ''M<u>\u00fc</u>tter'' \"mothers\"\n** [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''b<u>a</u>chg<u>e</u>n'' \"boy\" \u2013 ''b<u>e</u>chg<u>y</u>n'' \"boys\" <small>(See ''[[Affection (linguistics)|affection]]'')</small>\n* [[Reduplication]] (through doubling):\n** [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''orang'' \"person\" (singular) \u2013 ''orang-<u>orang</u>'' \"people\" (plural); '''BUT''' ''dua orang'' \"two people\" and ''banyak orang'' \"many people\" (reduplication is not done when the context is clear and when the plurality is not emphasized)\n** [[Pipil language|Pipil]]: ''kumit'' \"pot\" (singular) \u2013 ''<u>kuj</u>-kumit'' \"pots\" (plural); similar to Indonesian, reduplication is omitted when plurality is marked elsewhere or not emphasized.\n** [[Somali language|Somali]]: ''buug'' \"book\" (singular) \u2013 ''buug-<u>ag</u>'' \"books\" (plural)\n* [[Suppletion]] (the use of the one word as the inflected form of another word):\n** [[Serbo-Croatian]]: ''\u010dov(j)ek'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 ''ljudi'' \"men, folks\" (plural){{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 2001 | p = 64}}\n* [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonality]] (by changing a drag tone to a push tone)\n** [[Limburgish]]: ''da\u00e3g'' \"day\" (singular) \u2013 ''da\u00e0g'' \"days\" (plural)\n** [[Ancient Greek]]: \u03b3\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 ''gl\u00f4ssa'' \"tongue\" (singular) \u2013 \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 ''gl\u01d2ssa'' \"two tongues\" (dual)\n\nElements marking number may appear on nouns and [[pronoun]]s in [[dependent-marking language]]s or on [[verb]]s and [[adjectives]] in [[head-marking language]]s.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid #ccc; line-height: 1.3em;\"\n|- style=\"background: #efefef;\"\n!

In the equivalent in [[Western Apache]], a [[head-marking language]], a plural infix ''da-'' is added to the verb ''yi\u0142ch\u2019\u00edg\u00f3\u2019aah'' \"he is teaching him\", resulting in ''yi\u0142ch\u2019\u00eddag\u00f3\u2019aah'' \"he is teaching them\" while noun ''idiloh\u00ed'' \"cowboy\" is unmarked for number.\n\n===Number particles===\nPlurality is sometimes marked by a specialized number particle (or number word). This is frequent in Australian and Austronesian languages. An example from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] is the word ''mga'' [m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]: compare ''bahay'' \"house\" with ''mga bahay'' \"houses\". In [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], certain nouns optionally denote plurality by secondary stress: ''ing lal\u00e1ki'' \"man\" and ''ing bab\u00e1i'' \"woman\" become ''ding l\u00e1l\u00e1ki'' \"men\" and ''ding b\u00e1b\u00e1i'' \"women\".\n\n===Classifiers with number morphology===\nIn [[Sanskrit]] and some other languages, number and case are fused category and there is concord for number between a noun and its [[Predicate (grammar)|predicator]]. Some languages however (for example, [[Assamese language|Assamese]]) lack this feature.\n\nLanguages that show number inflection for a large enough corpus of nouns or allow them to combine directly with singular and plural numerals can be described as non-classifier languages. On the other hand, there are languages that obligatorily require a counter word or the so-called [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] for all nouns. For example, the category of number in Assamese is fused with the category of classifier, which always carries a definite/indefinite reading. The singularity or plurality of the noun is determined by the addition of the classifier [[suffix]] either to the noun or to the numeral. Number system in Assamese is either realized as numeral or as nominal inflection, but not both. Numerals [ek] 'one' and [dui] 'two', can be realized as both [[free morpheme]] and [[clitics]]. When used with classifiers, these two numerals are cliticised to the classifiers.\n\nPingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. In Pingelapese, the meaning, use, or shape of an object can be expressed through the use of numerical classifiers. These classifiers combine and noun and a number that together can give more details about the object. There are at least five sets of numerical classifiers in Pingelapese. Each classifier has a numeral part and a classifier part that corresponds to the noun it is describing. The classifier follows the noun in a phrase. There is a separate set of numerical classifiers that is used when the object is not specified. Examples of this is the names of the days of the week.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=Ann Arbor|year=2012|isbn=9781267817211|location=|pages=38\u201341|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Obligatoriness of number marking ===\nIn many languages, such as English, number is obligatorily expressed in every grammatical context. Some limit number expression to certain classes of nouns, such as [[animacy|animates]] or referentially prominent nouns (as with proximate forms in most [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]s, opposed to referentially less prominent obviative forms). In others, such as Chinese and Japanese, number marking is not consistently applied to most nouns unless a distinction is needed or already present.\n\nA very common situation is for plural number to not be marked if there is any other overt indication of number, as for example in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''vir\u00e1g'' \"flower\"; ''vir\u00e1gok'' \"flowers\"; ''hat vir\u00e1g'' \"six flowers\".\n\n===Transnumeral{{anchor|general number}}===\nMany languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], have optional number marking. In such cases, an unmarked noun is neither singular nor plural, but rather ambiguous as to number. This is called ''transnumeral'' or sometimes ''general number,'' abbreviated {{sc|'''trn'''}}. Many such languages have optional number marking, which tends to be used for definite and highly [[animacy hierarchy|animate]] referents, most notably first-person pronouns.\n\n=== Inverse number ===\nThe languages of the [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] family have three numbers \u2013 singular, dual, and plural \u2013 and exhibit an unusual system of marking number, called ''inverse number'' (or ''number toggling''). In this scheme, every [[count noun|countable noun]] has what might be called its \"inherent\" or \"expected\" numbers, and is unmarked for these. When a noun appears in an \"inverse\" (atypical) number, it is inflected to mark this. For example, in [[Jemez language|Jemez]], where nouns take the ending ''-sh'' to denote an inverse number, there are four [[noun class]]es which inflect for number as follows:\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;\"\n|-\n!class\n!description\n!singular\n!dual\n!plural\n|-\n!I\n|animate nouns\n| ''-''\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-sh''\n|-\n!II\n|some inanimate nouns\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-''\n|-\n!III\n|other inanimate nouns\n| ''-''\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-''\n|-\n!IV\n|mass (non-countable) nouns\n| (n/a)\n| (n/a)\n| (n/a)\n|}\n\nAs can be seen, class-I nouns are inherently singular, class-II nouns are inherently plural, class-III nouns are inherently singular or plural. Class-IV nouns cannot be counted and are never marked with ''-sh''.*<ref>{{Citation | last = Sprott | first = Robert | year = 1992 | title = Jemez syntax | type = doctoral dissertation | publisher = [[University of Chicago]] | place = US}}</ref>\n\nA similar system is seen in [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] (Kiowa is distantly related to Tanoan languages like Jemez):\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;\"\n|-\n! class\n! singular\n! dual\n! plural\n|-\n!

Using French as an example, one says ''je vois'' (''I see''), but ''nous voyons'' (''we see''). The verb ''voir'' (''to see'') changes from ''vois'' in the first person singular to ''voyons'' in the plural. In everyday English, this often happens in the third person (''she sees'', ''they see''), but not in other grammatical persons, except with the verb ''to be''.\n<!-- The next paragraph makes no sense to me ([[User:Ruakh|Ruakh]]), and I don't see anything obviously relevant in the linked articles, so I'm commenting it out until someone can explain it. (I think the problem might just be a misuse of linguistics terms; it makes no sense for a verb to \"refer\" to a noun, but maybe here it's being used to mean that the noun is the subject of the verb?)\nVerbs may agree with the number of nouns to which they refer, even when there is no other form of number agreement in a language. For more information on this special type of number agreement, see [[Grammatical person]], [[Verb]], and [[English verbs]].\n-->\n\n===Adjectives and determiners===\n[[Adjective]]s often agree with the number of the noun they modify. For example, in [[French language|French]], one says ''un grand arbre'' {{IPA|[\u0153\u0303 \u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303t a\u0281b\u0281]}} \"a tall tree\", but ''deux grands arbres'' {{IPA|[d\u00f8 \u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303 za\u0281b\u0281]}} \"two tall trees\". The singular adjective ''grand'' becomes ''grands'' in the plural, unlike English \"tall\", which remains unchanged.\n\nOther [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s may agree with number. In English, the [[demonstrative]]s \"this\", \"that\" change to \"these\", \"those\" in the plural, and the [[indefinite article]] \"a\", \"an\" is either omitted or changes to \"some\". In French and German, the [[definite article]]s have [[grammatical gender|gender distinctions]] in the singular but not the plural. In Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, both definite and indefinite articles are inflected for gender and number, e.g. Portuguese ''o, a'' \"the\" (singular, masc./fem.), ''os, as'' \"the\" (plural, masc./fem.); ''um, uma'' \"a(n)\" (singular, masc./fem.), ''uns, umas'' \"some\" (plural, masc./fem.), ''dois, duas'' \"two\" (plural, masc./fem.),\n\nIn the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] sentence ''Y\u00f6'''t''' o'''vat''' pime'''i'''t\u00e4'' \"Nights are dark\", each word referring to the plural noun ''y\u00f6t'' \"nights\" (\"night\" = ''y\u00f6'') is pluralized (night-<small>PL</small> is-<small>PL</small> dark-<small>PL</small>-[[partitive]]).\n\n=== Exceptions ===\n{{See also|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}\nSometimes, grammatical number will not represent the actual quantity. For example, in Ancient Greek [[Neuter gender|neuter]] plurals took a singular verb.<ref>[https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6417.learning-ancient-greek \u201cLearn Ancient Greek: 11_Unit 2 Agreement Infinitives Questions\u201d], video tutorial by Leonard Muellner and Belisi Gillespie at [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] at [[Harvard University]], published January 25, 2018; retrieved May 30, 2018</ref> The plural form of a pronoun may also be applied to a single individual as a sign of importance, respect or generality, as in the ''[[pluralis majestatis]]'', the [[T-V distinction]], and the [[generic you|generic \"you\"]], found in many languages, or, in English, when using the [[singular they|singular \"they\"]] for [[gender-neutrality]].\n\nIn [[Arabic grammar|Arabic]], the plural of a non-human noun (one that refers to an animal or to an [[animacy|inanimate]] entity regardless of whether the noun is grammatically masculine or feminine in the singular) is treated as feminine singular\u2014this is called the inanimate plural. For example:\n: \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 (''rajul jam\u012bl'') 'beautiful/handsome man': ''rajul'' (man) is masculine singular, so it takes the masculine singular adjective ''jam\u012bl''.\n: \u0628\u064a\u062a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 (''bayt jam\u012bl'') 'beautiful house': ''bayt'' (house) is masculine singular, so it takes the masculine singular ''jam\u012bl''.\n: \u0643\u0644\u0628 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 (''kalb jam\u012bl'') 'beautiful dog': ''kalb'' (dog) is masculine singular, so it takes the masculine singular ''jam\u012bl''.\n: \u0628\u0646\u062a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 (''bint jam\u012blah'') 'beautiful girl': ''bint'' is feminine singular, so it takes the feminine singular ''jam\u012blah''.\n: \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 (''sayy\u0101rah jam\u012blah'') 'beautiful car': ''sayy\u0101rah'' is feminine singular, so it takes the feminine singular ''jam\u012blah''.\n: \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0648\u0646 (''rij\u0101l jam\u012bl\u016bn'') 'beautiful/handsome men': ''rij\u0101l'' (men) is masculine plural, so it takes the masculine plural ''jam\u012bl\u016bn''.\n: \u0628\u0646\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062a (''ban\u0101t jam\u012bl\u0101t'') 'beautiful girls': ''ban\u0101t'' is feminine plural, so it takes the feminine plural ''jam\u012bl\u0101t''.\nbut\n: \u0628\u064a\u0648\u062a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 (''buy\u016bt jam\u012blah'') 'beautiful houses': ''buy\u016bt'' (houses) is non-human plural, and so takes the inanimate plural (feminine singular) ''jam\u012blah''.\n: \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 (''sayy\u0101r\u0101t jam\u012blah'') 'beautiful cars': ''sayy\u0101r\u0101t'' is non-human plural, and so takes the inanimate plural ''jam\u012blah''.\n: \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 (''kil\u0101b jam\u012blah'') 'beautiful dogs': ''kil\u0101b'' is non-human plural, and so takes the inanimate plural ''jam\u012blah''.\n\n===Collective nouns===\n{{Main |Collective noun}}\nA collective noun is a word that designates a group of objects or beings regarded as a whole, such as \"flock\", \"team\", or \"corporation\". Although many languages treat collective nouns as singular, in others they may be interpreted as plural. In [[British English]], phrases such as ''the committee are meeting'' are common (the so-called agreement ''in sensu'' \"in meaning\"; with the meaning of a noun, rather than with its form, see [[synesis|constructio ad sensum]]). The use of this type of construction varies with dialect and level of formality.\n\nIn some cases, the number marking on a verb with a collective subject may express the degree of collectivity of action:\n* ''The committee are discussing the matter'' (the individual members are discussing the matter), but ''the committee has decided on the matter'' (the committee has acted as an indivisible body).\n* ''The crowd is tearing down the fences'' (a crowd is doing something as a unit), but ''the crowd are cheering wildly'' (many individual members of the crowd are doing the same thing independently of each other).\n\n==Semantic versus grammatical number==\nAll languages are able to specify the quantity of referents. They may do so by [[lexicon|lexical]] means with words such as English ''a few'', ''some'', ''one'', ''two'', ''five hundred''. However, not every language has a grammatical category of number. Grammatical number is expressed by [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] or [[syntactic]] means. That is, it is indicated by certain grammatical elements, such as through [[affix]]es or number words. Grammatical number may be thought of as the indication of [[semantic]] number through [[grammar]].\n\nLanguages that express quantity only by lexical means lack a grammatical category of number. For instance, in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], neither nouns nor verbs carry any grammatical information concerning number: such information can only be conveyed by lexical items such as ''khlah'' 'some', ''pii-bey'' 'a few', and so on.<ref>{{Citation | contribution= Linguistic sketch | url= http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=75 | title= Khmer | type= article | publisher= UCLA Language Materials project (www.lmp.ucla.edu) | access-date= 2005-11-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060211185103/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=75 | archive-date= 2006-02-11 | url-status= dead }}.</ref>\n\n==Auxiliary languages==\n[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s often have fairly simple systems of grammatical number. In one of the most common schemes (found, for example, in [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]]), nouns and pronouns distinguish between singular and plural, but not other numbers, and adjectives and verbs do not display any number agreement. In [[Esperanto]], however, adjectives must agree in both number and case with the nouns that they qualify.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Count noun]]\n* [[Elohim]]\n* [[Generic antecedent]]\n* [[Agreement

linguistics, '''grammatical number''' is a [[grammatical category]] of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] that expresses count distinctions (such as \"one\", \"two\", or \"three or more\").<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsNumber.htm | publisher = SIL | title = Dictionary of Linguistic Terms | contribution = What is Number?}}.</ref> English and other languages present number categories of singular or [[plural]], both of which are cited by using the [[hash sign]] (#) or by the [[numero sign]]s \"No.\" and \"Nos.\" respectively. Some languages also have a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[Grammatical number#Trial|trial]], and [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]] number or other arrangements.\n\nThe count distinctions typically, but not always, correspond to the actual count of the [[referent]]s of the [[marker (linguistics)|marked]] noun or pronoun.\n\nThe word \"number\" is also used in linguistics to describe the distinction between certain grammatical aspects that indicate the number of times an event occurs, such as the [[semelfactive]] aspect, the iterative aspect, etc. For that use of the term, see \"[[Grammatical aspect]]\".\n\n==Overview==\nMost languages of the world have formal means to express differences of number. One widespread distinction, found in English and many other languages, involves a simple two-way number contrast between singular and plural (''car''/''cars'', ''child''/''children'', etc.). Discussion of other more elaborate systems of number appears below.\n\nGrammatical number is a morphological category characterized by the expression of [[quantity]] through inflection or agreement. As an example, consider the English sentences below:\n: ''That apple on the table is fresh.''\n: ''Those two apples on the table are fresh.''\nThe number of apples is marked on the noun\u2014\"apple\" '''singular number''' (one item) vs. \"apples\" '''plural number''' (more than one item)\u2014on the demonstrative, \"that/those\", and on the verb, \"is/are\". In the second sentence, all this information is [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]], since quantity is already indicated by the numeral \"two\".\n\nA language has grammatical number when its nouns are subdivided into [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological classes]] according to the quantity they express, such that:\n#Every [[noun]] belongs to a unique number class (nouns are partitioned into disjoint classes by number).\n#Noun [[modifier (linguistics)|modifiers]] (such as adjectives) and [[verb]]s may also have different forms for each number class and be [[inflection|inflected]] to match the number of the nouns to which they refer (number is an [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement category]]).\n\nThis is partly the case in English: every noun is either singular or plural (a few forms, such as \"fish\", can be either, according to context), and at least some modifiers of nouns\u2014namely the [[demonstrative]]s, the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]], the [[article (grammar)|articles]], and [[verb]]s\u2014are inflected to agree with the number of the nouns to which they refer: \"this car\" and \"these cars\" are correct, while \"*this cars\" or \"*these car\" are ungrammatical and, therefore, incorrect. However, adjectives are not inflected, and some verb forms do not distinguish between singular and plural (\"She/They went\", \"She/They can go\", \"She/They had gone\", \"She/They will go\"). Only count nouns can be freely used in the singular and in the plural. Mass nouns, like \"milk\", \"silverware\", and \"wisdom\", are normally used in only the singular form.<ref>{{Citation | last = Nicolas | first = David | year = 2008 | title = Mass nouns and plural logic | journal = Linguistics and Philosophy | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 211\u201344 | url = http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf | doi = 10.1007/s10988-008-9033-2 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219021719/http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf | archivedate = 2012-02-19 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.510.3305 }}.</ref> (In some cases, a normally mass noun '''''X''''' may be used as a count noun to collect several distinct kinds of '''''X''''' into an enumerable group; for example, a cheesemaker might speak of goat, sheep, and cow milk as ''milks''.) Many languages distinguish between count nouns and mass nouns.\n\nNot all languages have number as a grammatical category. In those that do not, quantity must be expressed either directly, with [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, or indirectly, through optional [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s. However, many of these languages compensate{{clarify|date=February 2015}} for the lack of grammatical number with an extensive system of [[measure word]]s.\n\nThere is a hierarchy among number categories: no language distinguishes a trial (indicating the number 3) unless it has a dual, and no language has a dual without a plural.{{Sfn | Greenberg | 1972}}\n\n==Geographical distribution==\nObligatory plural marking of all nouns is found throughout [[Eurasiatic languages|western and northern Eurasia]] and in [[Languages of Africa|most parts of Africa]]. The rest of the world presents a heterogeneous picture. Optional plural marking is particularly common in [[East Asian languages|Southeast and East Asia]] and [[Australian languages]], and complete lack of plural marking is particularly found in [[Papuan languages|New Guinea]] and Australian languages. In addition to the [[Areal feature|areal correlations]], there also seems to be at least one correlation with [[morphological typology]]: [[isolating languages]] appear to favor no or non-obligatory plural marking. This can be seen particularly in Africa, where optionality or absence of plural marking is found particularly in the isolating languages of West Africa.<ref>{{Citation | last = Good | first = JC | title = Kwa noun | url = http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcgood/jcgood-KwaNoun.pdf | publisher = Buffalo }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | chapter-url = http://wals.info/chapter/34 | title = Occurrence of Nominal Plurality | publisher = Wals | chapter = 34}}</ref>\n\n== Number in specific languages ==\n\n===English===\n{{Main |English plural}}\n[[English language|English]] is typical of most world languages, in distinguishing only between singular and plural number. The plural form of a noun is usually created by adding the [[suffix]] ''-(e)s''. The pronouns have irregular plurals, as in \"I\" versus \"we\", because they are ancient and frequently used words going back to when English had a well developed system of [[declension]]. English verbs distinguish singular from plural number in the third person present tense (\"He goes\" versus \"They go\"). English treats zero with the plural number. [[Old English]] also contained dual grammatical numbers.\n\n===Finnish===\n{{Further |Finnish grammar#Plurals}}\nThe [[Finnish language]] has a plural form of almost every noun case (except the comitative, which is formally only plural).\n* ''talo'' \u2013 house\n* ''talot'' \u2013 houses\n* ''taloissa'' \u2013 in the houses\n\nHowever, when a number is used, or a word signifying a number (monta- many), the singular version of the partitive case is used.\n* ''kolme taloa'' \u2013 three houses\n\nand where no specific number is mentioned, the plural version of the partitive case is used\n* taloja\n\nand in the possessive (genitive)\n* talon ovi (the house's door)\n* talojen ovet (the houses' doors)\n\n===French===\nIn modern Romance languages, nouns, adjectives and articles are declined according to number (singular or plural only). Verbs are conjugated for number as well as person. French treats zero as using the singular number, not the plural.\n\nIn its written form, [[French language|French]] declines nouns for number (singular or plural). In speech, however, the majority of nouns (and adjectives) are not declined for number. The typical plural suffix, ''-s'' or ''-es'', is [[silent letter|silent]], no longer indicating a change in pronunciation. Spoken number marking on the noun appears when [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] occurs.\n* some plurals do differ from the singular in pronunciation; for example, masculine singulars in ''-al'' {{IPA|[al]}} sometimes form masculine plurals in ''-aux'' {{IPA|[o]}}.\n* [[Proper nouns]] are not pluralized, even in writing. (''Les voitures'', but ''Les [[Peugeot 404]]'')\n\nNormally, the article or determiner is the primary spoken indicator of number.\n\n===Hebrew===\nIn Modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a [[Semitic language]], most nouns have only singular and plural forms, such as \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 {{IPA |/\u02c8sefe\u0281/}} \"book\" and \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/sfa\u02c8\u0281im/}} \"books\", but some have distinct dual forms using a distinct dual suffix (largely nouns pertaining to numbers or time, such as \u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/al\u02c8pajim/}} \"two thousand\" and \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/\u0283vu\u02c8ajim/}} \"two weeks\"), some use this dual suffix for their regular plurals (largely body parts that tend to come in pairs, such as \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/ei\u02c8najim/}} \"eyes\", as well as some that do not, such as \u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/\u0283i\u02c8najim/}} \"teeth\"), and some are inherently dual (such as \u05de\u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA |/mixna\u02c8sajim/}} \"pants\" and \u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd {{IPA|/ofa\u02c8najim/}} \"bicycle\"). Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns agree with their subjects' or antecedents' numbers, but only have a two-way distinction between singular and plural; dual nouns entail plural adjectives, verbs, and pronouns.\n\n===Russian===\n{{main|Russian declension#Numerals}}\n\nModern [[Russian language|Russian]] has a singular vs plural number system, but the [[declension]] of noun phrases containing numeral expressions follows complex rules. For example, \"\u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430/\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438/\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\" (\"I have one book-''nom. sing.''/three book-''gen. sing.''/five book-''gen. plur.''\"). See [[Dual (grammatical number)#Slavic languages|Dual number: Slavic languages]] for a discussion of number phrases in Russian and other Slavic languages.\n\nThe numeral \"one\" also has a plural form, used with [[pluralia tantum]]: \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044b/\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u044b \"one pair of jeans, one clock\".{{Sfn | Lunt | 1982 | p = 204}} The same form is used with countable nouns in meaning \"only\": \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0442\u044b \"There are only idiots around\".\n\n===Swedish===\n[[Swedish language|Swedish]] inflects nouns in singular and plural. The plural of the noun is usually obtained by adding a suffix, according to the noun's declension. The suffixes are as follows: -or in the 1st declension (e.g. flicka \u2013 flickor), -ar in the 2nd (e.g. bil \u2013 bilar), -er in the 3rd (e.g. katt \u2013 katter), -n in the 4th (e.g. \u00e4pple \u2013 \u00e4pplen) and no inflectional suffix is added for the nouns in the 5th declension (e.g. bord \u2013 bord). Verbs in Swedish do not distinguish singular from plural number, but adjectives do.\n\n=== Tokelauan ===\n[[Tokelau]] is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] Island consisting of three atolls. The [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]] language has three types of personal pronouns \u2013 1st person, 2nd person inclusive, 2nd person exclusive, and 3rd person exclusive. The language has unique ways to address multiple people in one conversation. For example, the generic greeting for \u2018Hello\u2019 is T\u0101lofa or M\u0101l\u014d. To greet one person, \u2018greetings to you\u2019 would be the same as the common greeting. To address two people, T\u0101lofa n\u012b/M\u0101l\u014d n\u012b Fakat\u0101lofa atu kia te koulua; koulua is the dual third person term. To address three or more people, Fakat\u0101lofa atu kia te koutou; koutou is the plural third person term.<ref>Hooper, Robin (1996). ''Tokelauan''. Munched, Germany: Lincom Europa. p. 1, 3. {{ISBN|3-929075-41-5}}.</ref>\n\n===Wuvulu-Aua===\n[[Wuvulu language|Wuvulu]] is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] Island located in the [[Manus Province]] of Papua New Guinea. The languages numbering system is multiplicative construction, where each number is based on multiplying pre-existing numbers smaller than five. Wuvulu is most similar to most [[Oceanic language]]s, and their numbering system is representative of some systems found in the Marshall Islands. For examples, the number two in Wuvulu is ''roa'' and the number four in both Proto-Oceanic language and Wuvulu is ''fa''. Therefore, the number eight in Wuvulu the construction of two and four, resulting in ''fainaroa'', translating into \"four multiply two\". Moreover, the Wuvulu language has different numerical systems for animate objects and inanimate objects. When referencing an inanimate object, the number seven is ''oloompalo''; however, if it is an animate object, the word changes to ''oloromea''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrod|first1=James|title=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|date=2014|page=73|url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JamesHaffordDraft.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> The structure of a noun phrase looks like \" NP=(ART/DEMONSTRATIVE+)(NUMBER/QUANTIFIER+)(PREMODIFIERS+)NOUN(+MODIFER.)

Pronouns, nouns and demonstratives are used exclusively in the singular and plural forms through the use of classifiers, suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people, Eastern Carolines, Trust Territory of Micronesia|last=Ward|first=William Theophilus Thomas|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> There are no other dual or trial grammatical forms in the Mortlockese language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Odango|first1=Emerson Lopez|title=Aff\u00e9\u00fa Fangani 'Join Together': A Morphophonemic Analysis of Possessive Suffix Paradigms and A Discourse-Based Ethnography of the Elicitation Session in Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese|date=May 2015|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa Dissertation|url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Dissertation_ODANGO-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> Different forms that can be used in the language include first person singular and plural words, second person singular words like \u201cumwi,\u201d second person plural words like \u201caumi\u201d used to refer to an outside group, and third person plural words.<ref>{{cite web|author=University of Hawaii at Manoa Hamilton|title=Narrative and identity construction in the Pacific Islands|url=http://reader.eblib.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/(S(bfec0qwyennsyhjjyoy3lxhr))/Reader.aspx?p=2040187&o=376&u=0GOyKO0ekzLvKJLaSEvKuw%3d%3d&t=1486402464&h=5B6C7F87B4062AECBD899D5821D51EF7A00B310D&s=53250598&ut=1139&pg=1&r=img&c=-1&pat=n&cms=-1&sd=2#|website=reader.eblib.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu|publisher=Philadelphia, PA : John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2015.}}</ref>\n\n==Types of number==\n\n===Singular versus plural===\n{{Main |Plural}}\nIn most languages with grammatical number, nouns, and sometimes other parts of speech, have two forms, the singular, for one instance of a concept, and the plural, for more than one instance. Usually, the singular is the [[marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] form of a word, and the plural is obtained by [[inflection|inflecting]] the singular. This is the case in English: ''car/cars, box/boxes, man/men''. There may be exceptional nouns whose plural is identical to the singular: ''one sheep/two sheep'' (which is not the same as nouns that have only one number).\n\n===Singulative versus collective===\n{{Main |Singulative number}}\nSome languages differentiate between an [[Null morpheme|unmarked]] form, the collective, which is indifferent in respect to number, and a marked form for single entities, called the singulative in this context. For example, in Welsh, ''moch'' (\"pigs\") is a basic form, whereas a suffix is added to form ''mochyn'' (\"pig\"). It is the collective form which is more basic, and it is used as an adjectival modifier, e.g. ''cig moch'' (\"pig meat\", \"pork\"). The collective form is therefore similar in many respects to an English mass noun like \"rice\", which in fact refers to a collection of items which are logically countable. However, English has no [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process of forming singulative nouns (just phrases such as \"a grain of rice\"). Therefore, English cannot be said to have a singulative number.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn other languages, singulatives can be regularly formed from [[collective noun]]s; e.g. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u062d\u062c\u0631}} ''\u1e25ajar'' \"stone\" \u2192 {{lang|ar|\u062d\u062c\u0631\u0629}} ''\u1e25ajara'' \"(individual) stone\", {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0642\u0631}} ''baqar'' \"cattle\" \u2192 {{lang|ar|\u0628\u0642\u0631\u0629}} ''baqara'' \"(single) cow\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In [[Russian language|Russian]], the suffix for forming singulative form is -\u0438\u043d- ''-in-''; e.g. \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 ''grad'' \"hail\" \u2192 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 ''gradina'' \"hailstone\", \u043b\u0451\u0434 ''lyod'' \"ice\" \u2192 \u043b\u044c\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 ''l'dina'' \"block of ice\". {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In both Russian and Arabic, the singulative form always takes on the feminine [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Dutch, singulative forms of collective nouns are occasionally made by diminutives: ''snoep'' \"sweets, candy\" \u2192 ''snoepje'' \"sweet, piece of candy\". These singulatives can be pluralised like most other nouns: ''snoepjes'' \"several sweets, pieces of candy\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Dual===\n{{Main |Dual (grammatical number)}}\nThe distinction between a \"singular\" number (one) and a \"plural\" number (more than one) found in English is not the only possible classification. Another one is \"singular\" (one), \"dual\" (two) and \"plural\" (more than two). Dual number existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], persisted in many ancient [[Indo-European languages]] that descended from it\u2014[[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Norse]], and [[Old English]] for example\u2014and can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as [[Slovene language|Slovene]].{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 2001 | pp = 63, 72\u201373}} Many more modern Indo-European languages show residual traces of the dual, as in the [[English language|English]] distinctions ''both'' vs. ''all'', ''either'' vs. ''any'', ''neither'' vs. ''none'', and so on. Former dual forms may broaden their meanings: Norwegian ''b\u00e5de'', for example, though cognate with English ''both'', can be used with more than two things, as in ''X sparer b\u00e5de tid, penger, og arbeid'', literally \"X saves both time, money, and labour\".\n\nMany [[Semitic languages]] also have dual number. For instance, in Arabic all nouns can have singular, plural, or dual forms. For non-[[broken plural]]s, masculine plural nouns end with \u0648\u0646 ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-\u016bn}}'' and feminine plural nouns end with \u0627\u062a ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-\u0101t}}'', whilst \u0627\u0646 ''{{transl |ar|DIN|-\u0101n}}'', is added to the end of a noun to indicate that it is dual (even among nouns that have broken plurals).\n\nPronouns in [[Polynesian languages]] such as [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] exhibit the singular, dual, and plural numbers.\n\nThe dual may be restricted to certain morphological categories. For example, in [[North Saami]], in possessive forms the possessor has three numbers (singular, dual, plural) whereas the noun possessed only has two (singular, plural).\n\n===Trial===\nThe trial number is a grammatical number referring to 'three items', in contrast to 'singular' (one item), 'dual' (two items), and 'plural' (four or more items). Several Austronesian languages such as [[Tolomako]], [[Lihir language|Lihir]], and [[Manam language|Manam]]; the [[Kiwaian languages]]; and the Austronesian-influenced creole languages [[Bislama]] and [[Tok Pisin]] have the trial number in their pronouns. No language has been documented to have trial number in its nouns.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010|reason=what source(s) say no language is known with trial number in its nouns?}}\n\n===Quadral===\nThe [[wikt:quadral|quadral]] number, if it existed, would denote [[4 (number)|four]] items together, as trial does three. No known natural language has it, nor is there any proof that any natural language ever did. It was once thought to exist in the pronoun systems of [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], spoken in the [[Marshall Islands]] in the Pacific Ocean,<ref>Gregersen, Edgar A., \"Language in Africa\", p. 62. (Note that Marshallese is not a language spoken in Africa.)</ref> and in [[Sursurunga language|Sursurunga]],<ref>Hutchisson, Don. 1986. Sursurunga pronouns and the special uses of quadral number.

While not all of these languages are adequately attested, it turns out that Sursurunga instead has both a \"lesser paucal\" (labeled \"trial\", but in fact referring to small groups, with typically three or four members) and a \"greater paucal\" (misnamed the \"quadral\", as it has a minimum of four, e.g. a pair of [[dyadic kin]] terms)\u2014the distinction is along the lines of \"a few\" vs. \"several\";\u2014and that what Marshallese actually has is a trial and a paucal.{{Sfn | Corbett | 2000 | pp = 25\u201330, 40, 46, 224, 317, 358}} None of them has a \"quadral\"; in at least two cases the field workers who originally suggested they did have a \"quadral\" were also the first to publish a peer-reviewed article contradicting that suggestion.\n\n===Paucal===\nPaucal number, for a few (as opposed to many) instances of the referent (e.g. in [[Hopi language|Hopi]], [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], [[Lower Sepik-Ramu languages]],<ref name=\"Foley-Sepik\">{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |authorlink=William A.

''\u044d\u0301\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0301\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c'' \u2013 this stone, [[Nominative|nom.]] sg.; ''\u044d\u0301\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0301\u043c\u043d\u0438'' \u2013 these stones, nom. pl.). [[Polish language|Polish]] functions similarly: 'one dog' is ''jeden pies''<nowiki/>', while (''2, 3, 4 psy'' \u2013 dogs, pl.; but ''5+ ps\u00f3w -'' dogs, gen. pl.). [[Slovene language|Slovene]] has one more distinction. With its use of dual ('one dog' is ''en pes'', 'two dogs' is ''dva psa''), paucal is only used for counting 3 and 4 (''3, 4 psi'' \u2013 dogs, pl.; but ''5+ psov'' \u2013 dogs, gen.pl.).\n\n===Distributive plural===\nDistributive plural number, for many instances viewed as independent individuals (for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]]).\n\n==Formal expression==\n[[Synthetic language]]s typically distinguish grammatical number by [[inflection]]. ([[Analytic language]]s, such as [[Chinese spoken language|Chinese]], often do not mark grammatical number.)\n\nSome languages have no [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] for the plural in certain cases, e.g. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''hus'' \u2013 \"house, houses\" (but ''huset'' \u2013 \"the house\", ''husen'' \u2013 \"the houses\").\n\nIn most languages, the singular is formally unmarked, whereas the plural is marked in some way. Other languages, most notably the [[Bantu languages]], mark both the singular and the plural, for instance [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (see example below). The third logical possibility, found in only a few languages such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], is an unmarked plural contrasting with marked singular. Below are some examples of number [[affix]]es for nouns (where the inflecting [[morpheme]]s are underlined):\n\n* [[Affix]]ation (by adding or removing [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, [[infix]]es, or [[circumfix]]es):\n** [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''puu'' \"tree, wood\" (singular) \u2013 ''puu<u>d</u>'' \"the trees, woods\" (nominative plural), or ''kolm puud'' \"three trees\" ([[Partitive case|partitive]] singular)\n** [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''lehm\u00e4'' \"cow, the cow\" (singular) \u2013 ''lehm\u00e4<u>t</u>'' \"the cows\" ([[nominative]] plural)\n** [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''da\u011f'' \"the mountain\" (singular) \u2013 ''da\u011f<u>lar</u>'' \"mountains\" (plural)\n** [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''{{lang|sl|l\u00edp<u>a</u>}}'' \"linden\" (singular) \u2013 ''{{lang|sl|l\u00edp<u>i</u>}}'' \"linden\" (dual) \u2013 ''{{lang|sl|l\u00edp<u>e</u>}}'' \"linden\" (plural)\n** [[Sanskrit]]: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0938\u094d ''puru\u1e63<u>as</u>'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094c ''puru\u1e63<u>au</u>'' \"two men\" (dual) \u2013 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u093e\u0938\u094d ''puru\u1e63<u>\u0101s</u>'' \"men\" (plural)\n** [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca ''mal<u>ak</u>'' \"flower\" (singular) \u2013 \u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca ''mal'' \"flowers\" (plural)\n** [[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''<u>m</u>toto'' \"child\" (singular) \u2013 ''<u>wa</u>toto'' \"children\" (plural)\n** [[Luganda|Ganda]]: ''<u>omu</u>sajja'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 ''<u>aba</u>sajja'' \"men\" (plural)\n** [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: \u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8 ''k'aci'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 \u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 ''k'ac<u>eb</u>i'' \"men\" (where ''-i'' is the nominative case marker)\n** [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''plant'' \"children\" (collective) \u2013 ''pl<u>e</u>nt<u>yn</u>'' \"child\" (singulative) <small>Care should be taken with Welsh not to confuse ''singulative/collective'' with ''singular/plural'', see [[Colloquial Welsh nouns]].</small>\n* [[Simulfix]] (through various kinds of internal [[Apophony|sound alternations]]):\n** [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628 ''k<u>i</u>t<u>\u0101</u>b'' \"book\" (singular) \u2013 \u0643\u064f\u062a\u064f\u0628 ''k<u>u</u>t<u>u</u>b'' \"books\" (plural)\n* [[Apophony]] (alternating between different vowels):\n** [[Dinka language|Dinka]]: ''k<u>a</u>t'' \"frame\" \u2013 ''k<u>\u025b</u>t'' \"frames\"\n** [[English language|English]]: ''f<u>oo</u>t'' \u2013 ''f<u>ee</u>t''\n** [[German language|German]]: ''M<u>u</u>tter'' \"mother\" \u2013 ''M<u>\u00fc</u>tter'' \"mothers\"\n** [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''b<u>a</u>chg<u>e</u>n'' \"boy\" \u2013 ''b<u>e</u>chg<u>y</u>n'' \"boys\" <small>(See ''[[Affection (linguistics)|affection]]'')</small>\n* [[Reduplication]] (through doubling):\n** [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''orang'' \"person\" (singular) \u2013 ''orang-<u>orang</u>'' \"people\" (plural); '''BUT''' ''dua orang'' \"two people\" and ''banyak orang'' \"many people\" (reduplication is not done when the context is clear and when the plurality is not emphasized)\n** [[Pipil language|Pipil]]: ''kumit'' \"pot\" (singular) \u2013 ''<u>kuj</u>-kumit'' \"pots\" (plural); similar to Indonesian, reduplication is omitted when plurality is marked elsewhere or not emphasized.\n** [[Somali language|Somali]]: ''buug'' \"book\" (singular) \u2013 ''buug-<u>ag</u>'' \"books\" (plural)\n* [[Suppletion]] (the use of the one word as the inflected form of another word):\n** [[Serbo-Croatian]]: ''\u010dov(j)ek'' \"man\" (singular) \u2013 ''ljudi'' \"men, folks\" (plural){{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 2001 | p = 64}}\n* [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonality]] (by changing a drag tone to a push tone)\n** [[Limburgish]]: ''da\u00e3g'' \"day\" (singular) \u2013 ''da\u00e0g'' \"days\" (plural)\n** [[Ancient Greek]]: \u03b3\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 ''gl\u00f4ssa'' \"tongue\" (singular) \u2013 \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 ''gl\u01d2ssa'' \"two tongues\" (dual)\n\nElements marking number may appear on nouns and [[pronoun]]s in [[dependent-marking language]]s or on [[verb]]s and [[adjectives]] in [[head-marking language]]s.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid #ccc; line-height: 1.3em;\"\n|- style=\"background: #efefef;\"\n!

In the equivalent in [[Western Apache]], a [[head-marking language]], a plural infix ''da-'' is added to the verb ''yi\u0142ch\u2019\u00edg\u00f3\u2019aah'' \"he is teaching him\", resulting in ''yi\u0142ch\u2019\u00eddag\u00f3\u2019aah'' \"he is teaching them\" while noun ''idiloh\u00ed'' \"cowboy\" is unmarked for number.\n\n===Number particles===\nPlurality is sometimes marked by a specialized number particle (or number word). This is frequent in Australian and Austronesian languages. An example from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] is the word ''mga'' [m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]: compare ''bahay'' \"house\" with ''mga bahay'' \"houses\". In [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], certain nouns optionally denote plurality by secondary stress: ''ing lal\u00e1ki'' \"man\" and ''ing bab\u00e1i'' \"woman\" become ''ding l\u00e1l\u00e1ki'' \"men\" and ''ding b\u00e1b\u00e1i'' \"women\".\n\n===Classifiers with number morphology===\nIn [[Sanskrit]] and some other languages, number and case are fused category and there is concord for number between a noun and its [[Predicate (grammar)|predicator]]. Some languages however (for example, [[Assamese language|Assamese]]) lack this feature.\n\nLanguages that show number inflection for a large enough corpus of nouns or allow them to combine directly with singular and plural numerals can be described as non-classifier languages. On the other hand, there are languages that obligatorily require a [[counter word]] or the so-called [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] for all nouns. For example, the category of number in Assamese is fused with the category of classifier, which always carries a definite/indefinite reading. The singularity or plurality of the noun is determined by the addition of the classifier [[suffix]] either to the noun or to the numeral. Number system in Assamese is either realized as numeral or as nominal inflection, but not both. Numerals [ek] 'one' and [dui] 'two', can be realized as both [[free morpheme]] and [[clitics]]. When used with classifiers, these two numerals are cliticised to the classifiers.\n\nPingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. In Pingelapese, the meaning, use, or shape of an object can be expressed through the use of numerical classifiers. These classifiers combine and noun and a number that together can give more details about the object. There are at least five sets of numerical classifiers in Pingelapese. Each classifier has a numeral part and a classifier part that corresponds to the noun it is describing. The classifier follows the noun in a phrase. There is a separate set of numerical classifiers that is used when the object is not specified. Examples of this is the names of the days of the week.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|publisher=Ann Arbor|year=2012|isbn=9781267817211|location=|pages=38\u201341|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Obligatoriness of number marking ===\nIn many languages, such as English, number is obligatorily expressed in every grammatical context. Some limit number expression to certain classes of nouns, such as [[animacy|animates]] or referentially prominent nouns (as with proximate forms in most [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]s, opposed to referentially less prominent obviative forms). In others, such as Chinese and Japanese, number marking is not consistently applied to most nouns unless a distinction is needed or already present.\n\nA very common situation is for plural number to not be marked if there is any other overt indication of number, as for example in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''vir\u00e1g'' \"flower\"; ''vir\u00e1gok'' \"flowers\"; ''hat vir\u00e1g'' \"six flowers\".\n\n===Transnumeral{{anchor|general number}}===\nMany languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], have optional number marking. In such cases, an unmarked noun is neither singular nor plural, but rather ambiguous as to number. This is called ''transnumeral'' or sometimes ''general number,'' abbreviated {{sc|'''trn'''}}. Many such languages have optional number marking, which tends to be used for definite and highly [[animacy hierarchy|animate]] referents, most notably first-person pronouns.\n\n=== Inverse number ===\nThe languages of the [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] family have three numbers \u2013 singular, dual, and plural \u2013 and exhibit an unusual system of marking number, called ''inverse number'' (or ''number toggling''). In this scheme, every [[count noun|countable noun]] has what might be called its \"inherent\" or \"expected\" numbers, and is unmarked for these. When a noun appears in an \"inverse\" (atypical) number, it is inflected to mark this. For example, in [[Jemez language|Jemez]], where nouns take the ending ''-sh'' to denote an inverse number, there are four [[noun class]]es which inflect for number as follows:\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;\"\n|-\n!class\n!description\n!singular\n!dual\n!plural\n|-\n!I\n|animate nouns\n| ''-''\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-sh''\n|-\n!II\n|some inanimate nouns\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-''\n|-\n!III\n|other inanimate nouns\n| ''-''\n| ''-sh''\n| ''-''\n|-\n!IV\n|mass (non-countable) nouns\n| (n/a)\n| (n/a)\n| (n/a)\n|}\n\nAs can be seen, class-I nouns are inherently singular, class-II nouns are inherently plural, class-III nouns are inherently singular or plural. Class-IV nouns cannot be counted and are never marked with ''-sh''.*<ref>{{Citation | last = Sprott | first = Robert | year = 1992 | title = Jemez syntax | type = doctoral dissertation | publisher = [[University of Chicago]] | place = US}}</ref>\n\nA similar system is seen in [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] (Kiowa is distantly related to Tanoan languages like Jemez):\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;\"\n|-\n! class\n! singular\n! dual\n! plural\n|-\n!

Using French as an example, one says ''je vois'' (''I see''), but ''nous voyons'' (''we see''). The verb ''voir'' (''to see'') changes from ''vois'' in the first person singular to ''voyons'' in the plural. In everyday English, this often happens in the third person (''she sees'', ''they see''), but not in other grammatical persons, except with the verb ''to be''.\n<!-- The next paragraph makes no sense to me ([[User:Ruakh|Ruakh]]), and I don't see anything obviously relevant in the linked articles, so I'm commenting it out until someone can explain it. (I think the problem might just be a misuse of linguistics terms; it makes no sense for a verb to \"refer\" to a noun, but maybe here it's being used to mean that the noun is the subject of the verb?)\nVerbs may agree with the number of nouns to which they refer, even when there is no other form of number agreement in a language. For more information on this special type of number agreement, see [[Grammatical person]], [[Verb]], and [[English verbs]].\n-->\n\n===Adjectives and determiners===\n[[Adjective]]s often agree with the number of the noun they modify. For example, in [[French language|French]], one says ''un grand arbre'' {{IPA|[\u0153\u0303 \u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303t a\u0281b\u0281]}} \"a tall tree\", but ''deux grands arbres'' {{IPA|[d\u00f8 \u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303 za\u0281b\u0281]}} \"two tall trees\". The singular adjective ''grand'' becomes ''grands'' in the plural, unlike English \"tall\", which remains unchanged.\n\nOther [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s may agree with number. In English, the [[demonstrative]]s \"this\", \"that\" change to \"these\", \"those\" in the plural, and the [[indefinite article]] \"a\", \"an\" is either omitted or changes to \"some\". In French and German, the [[definite article]]s have [[grammatical gender|gender distinctions]] in the singular but not the plural. In Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, both definite and indefinite articles are inflected for gender and number, e.g. Portuguese ''o, a'' \"the\" (singular, masc./fem.), ''os, as'' \"the\" (plural, masc./fem.); ''um, uma'' \"a(n)\" (singular, masc./fem.), ''uns, umas'' \"some\" (plural, masc./fem.), ''dois, duas'' \"two\" (plural, masc./fem.),\n\nIn the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] sentence ''Y\u00f6'''t''' o'''vat''' pime'''i'''t\u00e4'' \"Nights are dark\", each word referring to the plural noun ''y\u00f6t'' \"nights\" (\"night\" = ''y\u00f6'') is pluralized (night-<small>PL</small> is-<small>PL</small> dark-<small>PL</small>-[[partitive]]).\n\n=== Exceptions ===\n{{See also|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}\nSometimes, grammatical number will not represent the actual quantity. For example, in Ancient Greek [[Neuter gender|neuter]] plurals took a singular verb.<ref>[https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6417.learning-ancient-greek \u201cLearn Ancient Greek: 11_Unit 2 Agreement Infinitives Questions\u201d], video tutorial by Leonard Muellner and Belisi Gillespie at [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] at [[Harvard University]], published January 25, 2018; retrieved May 30, 2018</ref> The plural form of a pronoun may also be applied to a single individual as a sign of importance, respect or generality, as in the ''[[pluralis majestatis]]'', the [[T-V distinction]], and the [[generic you|generic \"you\"]], found in many languages, or, in English, when using the [[singular they|singular \"they\"]] for [[gender-neutrality]].\n\nIn [[Arabic grammar|Arabic]], the plural of a non-human noun (one that refers to an animal or to an [[animacy|inanimate]] entity regardless of whether the noun is grammatically masculine or feminine in the singular) is treated as feminine singular\u2014this is called the inanimate plural.

Although many languages treat collective nouns as singular, in others they may be interpreted as plural. In [[British English]], phrases such as ''the committee are meeting'' are common (the so-called agreement ''in sensu'' \"in meaning\"; with the meaning of a noun, rather than with its form, see [[synesis|constructio ad sensum]]). The use of this type of construction varies with dialect and level of formality.\n\nIn some cases, the number marking on a verb with a collective subject may express the degree of collectivity of action:\n* ''The committee are discussing the matter'' (the individual members are discussing the matter), but ''the committee has decided on the matter'' (the committee has acted as an indivisible body).\n* ''The crowd is tearing down the fences'' (a crowd is doing something as a unit), but ''the crowd are cheering wildly'' (many individual members of the crowd are doing the same thing independently of each other).\n\n==Semantic versus grammatical number==\nAll languages are able to specify the quantity of referents. They may do so by [[lexicon|lexical]] means with words such as English ''a few'', ''some'', ''one'', ''two'', ''five hundred''. However, not every language has a grammatical category of number. Grammatical number is expressed by [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] or [[syntactic]] means. That is, it is indicated by certain grammatical elements, such as through [[affix]]es or number words. Grammatical number may be thought of as the indication of [[semantic]] number through [[grammar]].\n\nLanguages that express quantity only by lexical means lack a grammatical category of number. For instance, in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], neither nouns nor verbs carry any grammatical information concerning number: such information can only be conveyed by lexical items such as ''khlah'' 'some', ''pii-bey'' 'a few', and so on.<ref>{{Citation | contribution= Linguistic sketch | url= http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=75 | title= Khmer | type= article | publisher= UCLA Language Materials project (www.lmp.ucla.edu) | access-date= 2005-11-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060211185103/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=75 | archive-date= 2006-02-11 | url-status= dead }}.</ref>\n\n==Auxiliary languages==\n[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s often have fairly simple systems of grammatical number. In one of the most common schemes (found, for example, in [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]]), nouns and pronouns distinguish between singular and plural, but not other numbers, and adjectives and verbs do not display any number agreement. In [[Esperanto]], however, adjectives must agree in both number and case with the nouns that they qualify.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Count noun]]\n* [[Elohim]]\n* [[Generic antecedent]]\n* [[Agreement

{"title_page": "A-not-A question", "text_new": "{{Short description|Polar question found primarily in Chinese languages}}\nIn [[linguistics]], an '''A-not-A question''', also known as an '''A-neg-A''' question, is a [[polar question]] that offers two opposite possibilities for the answer. Predominantly researched in [[Sinitic]] languages, the A-not-A question offers a choice between an affirmative [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and its negative counterpart. They are functionally regarded as a type of [[Yes\u2013no question|\"yes/no\" question]], though A-not-A questions have a unique interrogative type pattern which does not permit simple yes/no answers and instead requires a response that echoes the original question. Therefore, to properly answer the query, the recipient must select the positive (affirmative form \"A\") or negative (negative predicate form \"not-A\") version and use it in the formation of their response.<ref name=\"gasde\" /> A-not-A questions are often interpreted as having a \"neutral\" presupposition or are used in neutral contexts,<ref name=\":2\">Law, Ann (2001) A-not-A questions in Cantonese. UCLWPL 13, 295-318.</ref> meaning that the interrogator does not presume the truth value of the proposition expressed in the question. The overarching principle is the value-neutral contrast of the positive and negative forms of a premise. The label of \"A-not-A question\" may refer to the specific occurrence of these question types in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or, more broadly, to encompass other dialect-specific question types such as ''kam'' questions in [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] or ''ka'' questions in Singapore Teochew (ST), though these types possess unique properties and can even occur in [[complementary distribution]] with the A-not-A question type.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Dexi|date=1985|title=Hanyu Fangyan de Liang-Zhong Fanfu Wenju.

These forms are differentiated on the basis of the location of the Negation constituent and the presence or absence of duplicate material.\n\n=== A-not-A form ===\nThis is the most atomic form of the A-not-A question, which contains two identical instances of the constituent A separated by negation.\n\n=== AB-not-AB form ===\nThis is a more complex form, containing two instances of the complex constituent AB separated by the negation. AB may represent an embedded clause, a subject joined with a prepositional phrase, or a verb phrase containing a DP.\n\n=== A-not-AB form ===\nThis form contains two unique constituents, A and AB, separated by the negation. A and AB are similar in that AB contains the entire content of A, but constituents are present in AB that are not present in A.\n\n=== AB-not-A form ===\nThis form is similar to the A-not-AB form, but the more complex constituent AB occurs before the negation.\n\n=== a-not-A form ===\nThis form is only found in instances where A is disyllabic constituent with initial syllable a, and the two constituents are separated by negation.\n\n=== a-not-AB form ===\nThis form is similar to the a-not-A form with a representing the initial syllable of A and the two separated by negation, but A is joined to another constituent to form the complex constituent AB.\n\n==In English==\n\nAn example of an A-not-A question in English is in (1.a) \"Are you happy or sad?\". The response to this question must be an [[echo answer]], stating either \"I am happy,\" or the acceptable alternative, \"I am sad\". In other words, this sentence is a [[leading question]], where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) \"Are you happy or not?\" is a neutral question where the answer to this can be [[yes and no|yes or no]] in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.<ref>Matthew S.

This question must be answered in the \"A\" or \"not A\" form. If this question was asked in the A-not-A pattern, its direct form would be \"Did John eat or not eat the beans?\".  However, the above examples also illustrate that A-not-A type questions in English usually contain some comparative operator such as \"or\" which is not seen in the Sinitic forms. There is also no significant evidence of either of the disyllabic A-not-A forms in English. These factors complicate the inclusion of English in the set of languages that contain the A-not-A question type, and though there are close English approximations in some cases, The A-not-A question is more accurately exemplified in Sinitic Languages.\n\n=== Approximations ===\nBelow are examples of English approximations of the A-not-A question. They are similar to the Sinitic A-not-A in that they present two possibilities and require an echoed response. However, they include an extra segment (\"or\" in the below examples) in order to read grammatically, which changes these approximations to an alternative question (AltQ) type. This extra segment is not seen in Sinitic A-not-A questions, and in fact the mandarin segment ''hahshi'' 'or' is used to contrast the syntax of the A-not-A form and demonstrate the latter's sensitivity to islands. Nevertheless, for the convenience of understanding this phenomenon from the perspective of an English speaker, the below examples are included to provide context.\n\n==== A-not-A form ====\n (1) Was John at the party or not at the party?\n\n==== AB-not-A form ====\n (2) Was John at the party last night or not at the party?\n\n==== A-not-AB form ====\n (4) Was John at the party or not at the party last night?\n\n==== AB-not-AB form ====\n (3) Was John at the party last night or not at the party last night?\n\n== In Sinitic ==\n\n=== NQ Morpheme ===\nIt is proposed that the A-not-A sequence is morpheme created by the reduplication of the interrogative morpheme (represented by the A in A-not-A).<ref name=\":5\" /> Though the specific syntactic location of this morpheme is not agreed upon, it is generally accepted that the A-not-A sequence is essentially a word formed by the concatenation of an abstract question morpheme and this duplicated predicate, which likens it to a VP-proclitic. This Morpheme is referred to as NQ in order to represent its character as negative and interrogative.\n\n=== Similarity to kam-type questions ===\nAn extensive cross-dialectic survey conducted in 1985 concluded that the Taiwanese question particle kam appears in the same contexts as the hypothesized Mandarin NQ.<ref name=\":4\" /> From this, it was concluded that kam-type questions and A-not-A questions are in complementary distribution: a language either has kam-type questions or A-not-A questions but not both. It was also interpreted that kam and NQ are \"different morphological exponents of the same underlying morpheme\".<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Movement, sensitivity, and parallels to weishenme 'why' ===\nUnlike the yes/no question type formed using the segment \"ma\", the A-not-A question can be embedded, and may scope beyond its own clause. This scoping may be blocked if the original location of NQ and its intended final location are separated by an [[Island (linguistics)|island]] boundary.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=HUANG|first=C. T.

Due to the uncontroversial nature of the movement-based analysis of ''weishenme,'' the similarity of the NQ to ''weishenme'' implies that NQ amy be subject to the same analysis of its movement.\n\n==== Sensitivity to islands {{Definition needed|date=August 2019}}====\nThe dominant view on A-not-A questions is that NQ is similar to a wh-word and related by the movement of NQ.<ref>{{Citation|last=Huang|first=C.-T.

Due to this syntactic differentiation, A-not-A questions may be contrasted with ''haishi'' questions for the purpose of revealing island sensitivity.\n\n== Sinitic examples ==\nThe following are examples of A-not-A questions in languages belonging to the [[Sinitic linguistic family]].\n\n===In Mandarin===\n\nIn forming A-not-A questions, A must remain the same on both sides.  A is essentially a variable which can be replaced with a grammatical particle such as a [[Modal verb|modal]], adverb, adjective, verb, or preposition.\n\n==== Patterns ====\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], there are 6 attested patterns of A-not-A: A-not-A, AB-not-AB, A-not-AB, AB-not-A, a-not-A, and a-not-AB of which \"A\" stands for the full form of the predicate, \"B\" stands for the complement, and \"a\" stands for the first syllable of a disyllabic predicate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|last=Clare|first=Li|date=2017|title=The syntactic and pragmatic properties of a-not-a question in Chinese |hdl=10092/13628}}</ref>\n\n===== A-not-A form<ref name=\":1\" />=====\nExample (3) illustrates that A-not-A pattern, where A is the verb {{transl|cmn|qu}} 'go', and {{transl|cmn|qu bu qu}} is 'go not go'.\n          (3) \u4f60  '''\u53bb'''  \u4e0d  '''\u53bb'''\uff1f       \n              {{transl|cmn|ni  '''qu'''  bu  '''qu'''}}      \n              you '''go'''  not '''go'''    \n              Are you going?\n\n===== AB-not-AB form<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=L\u00fc|date=1985|title=\u7591\u6587 \u5426\u5b9a \u80af\u5b9a Yiwen, Fouding, Kending (Questioning, Negation, Affirmation)|url=|journal=\u4e2d\u570b\u8a9e\u6587 Zhongguo Yuwen|volume=4|pages=241\u2013250|via=}}</ref>=====\nExample (4) illustrates the AB-not-AB pattern, where AB is the constituent consisting of the verb {{transl|cmn|rende}}, 'know', as A, and the complement ''{{transl|cmn|zhe ge ren}}'', 'this CL man', as B, combining to form the AB constituent ''{{transl|cmn|rende zhe ge ren}}'' 'know this CL man'.

First, the A-not-A operator targets the [[morphosyntactic]] word (MWd) which is the head that is closest to it and undergoes lowering. Then, [[reduplication]] occurs to yield the surface form of the A-not-A question.<ref name=tseng>Tseng, W. H. K., & Lin, T. H. J. (2009). A Post-Syntactic Approach to the A-not-A Questions. UST Working Papers in Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 107-139.</ref>\n\n[[File:MWd vs SWd.png|thumb|Syntactic distinctions between morphosyntactic words (MWd) and subwords (SWd)]]\n\nTseng suggests that A-not-A occurs post-syntactically, at the morphological level. It is movement that occurs overtly at the [[Phonetics|phonetic]] form, after the syntactic movement has occurred. A-not-A is a feature of T that operates on the closest, c-commanded MWd, and not subwords (SWd). The elements that undergo post-syntactic movement are MWds. A node X  is a MWd iff X is the highest segment and X is not contained in another X. A node X is a SWd if X  is a terminal node and not an MWd.<ref name=tseng /> The A-not-A operation is a MWd to MWd movement.\n\n===Conditional criteria for grammatical A-not-A question derivation===\n\n====A-not-A operator lowering====\nThe A-not-A operator is defined as an MWd. The A-not-A operator can only lower to a MWd which is immediately dominated by the [[Government and binding theory#Government|maximal projection]] that is also immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. An SWd cannot be the target for the A-not-A operator. In addition, if there is an intervening MWd or SWd between the A-not-A operator and its target, the A-not-A operation fails.<ref name=tseng />\n\nA-not-A operator lowering must satisfy four conditions:\n\n# The A-not-A operator targets the closest MWd that is the [[X-bar theory|X\u2032-theoretic head]] that it [[c-command]]s.\n# Closeness of the head is qualified by: (i) The closest head is a X\u2032-theoretic head of the maximal which is immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. (ii) The target must have overt phonological realization. \n# There is not any non-X\u2032-theoretic head or SWd intervening between the A-not-A operator and its target. \n# Intervention is defined by c-command relation.\n\n[[File:Grammatical a-not-a lowering, xihuan Lisi.png|thumb|right|Grammatical A-not-A operator lowering to adjacent MWd verb ''xihuan''.

Even though ''hen'' is the closest adjacent MWd, it is not an X\u2019-theoretical head, thus lowering to it violates A-not-A lowering conditions]]\n\nAfter lowering, the A-not-A operator triggers [[reduplication]] on the target node. The reduplication domain can be the first syllable of the targeted element, the targeted element itself, and the [[Government and binding theory#Government|maximal projection]] that contains the targeted element. Reduplication is linear and the A-not-A operator cannot skip the adjacent constituent to copy the next constituent.<ref name=tseng />\n\n====Reduplication of first syllable of adjacent morphosyntactic word====\nIn first syllable reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable of the adjacent MWd and moves the [[reduplicant]], i.e. copied syllable, to the left of the base MWd. Then the negation is inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (33.a), the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable {{transl|zh|tao}} of the MWd {{transl|zh|taoyan}}. The reduplicant {{transl|zh|tao}} is put at the left of the base {{transl|zh|taoyan}} and then the negative constituent {{transl|zh|bu}} is inserted in between.

Otherwise, the reduplicant can move [[Covert (linguistics)|covertly]], i.e. in such a way that there is no overt surface evidence, to the right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (34.a) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd {{transl|zh|taoyan}}. The reduplicant {{transl|zh|taoyan}} is overtly put at the left of the base {{transl|zh|taoyan}} and then the negative constituent {{transl|zh|bu}} is inserted in between.

Predominantly researched in [[Sinitic]] languages, the A-not-A question offers a choice between an affirmative [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and its negative counterpart. They are functionally regarded as a type of [[Yes\u2013no question|\"yes/no\" question]], though A-not-A questions have a unique interrogative type pattern which does not permit simple yes/no answers and instead requires a response that echoes the original question. Therefore, to properly answer the query, the recipient must select the positive (affirmative form \"A\") or negative (negative predicate form \"not-A\") version and use it in the formation of their response.<ref name=\"gasde\" /> A-not-A questions are often interpreted as having a \"neutral\" presupposition or are used in neutral contexts,<ref name=\":2\">Law, Ann (2001) A-not-A questions in Cantonese.

These forms are differentiated on the basis of the location of the Negation constituent and the presence or absence of duplicate material.\n\n=== A-not-A form ===\nThis is the most atomic form of the A-not-A question, which contains two identical instances of the constituent A separated by negation.\n\n=== AB-not-AB form ===\nThis is a more complex form, containing two instances of the complex constituent AB separated by the negation. AB may represent an embedded clause, a subject joined with a prepositional phrase, or a verb phrase containing a DP.\n\n=== A-not-AB form ===\nThis form contains two unique constituents, A and AB, separated by the negation. A and AB are similar in that AB contains the entire content of A, but constituents are present in AB that are not present in A.\n\n=== AB-not-A form ===\nThis form is similar to the A-not-AB form, but the more complex constituent AB occurs before the negation.\n\n=== a-not-A form ===\nThis form is only found in instances where A is disyllabic constituent with initial syllable a, and the two constituents are separated by negation.\n\n=== a-not-AB form ===\nThis form is similar to the a-not-A form with a representing the initial syllable of A and the two separated by negation, but A is joined to another constituent to form the complex constituent AB.\n\n==In English==\n\nAn example of an A-not-A question in English is in (1.a) \"Are you happy or sad?\". The response to this question must be an [[echo answer]], stating either \"I am happy,\" or the acceptable alternative, \"I am sad\". In other words, this sentence is a [[leading question]], where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) \"Are you happy or not?\" is a neutral question where the answer to this can be [[yes and no|yes or no]] in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.<ref>Matthew S.

This question must be answered in the \"A\" or \"not A\" form. If this question was asked in the A-not-A pattern, its direct form would be \"Did John eat or not eat the beans?\".  However, the above examples also illustrate that A-not-A type questions in English usually contain some comparative operator such as \"or\" which is not seen in the Sinitic forms. There is also no significant evidence of either of the disyllabic A-not-A forms in English. These factors complicate the inclusion of English in the set of languages that contain the A-not-A question type, and though there are close English approximations in some cases, The A-not-A question is more accurately exemplified in Sinitic Languages.\n\n=== Approximations ===\nBelow are examples of English approximations of the A-not-A question. They are similar to the Sinitic A-not-A in that they present two possibilities and require an echoed response. However, they include an extra segment (\"or\" in the below examples) in order to read grammatically, which changes these approximations to an alternative question (AltQ) type. This extra segment is not seen in Sinitic A-not-A questions, and in fact the mandarin segment ''hahshi'' 'or' is used to contrast the syntax of the A-not-A form and demonstrate the latter's sensitivity to islands. Nevertheless, for the convenience of understanding this phenomenon from the perspective of an English speaker, the below examples are included to provide context.\n\n==== A-not-A form ====\n (1) Was John at the party or not at the party?\n\n==== AB-not-A form ====\n (2) Was John at the party last night or not at the party?\n\n==== A-not-AB form ====\n (4) Was John at the party or not at the party last night?\n\n==== AB-not-AB form ====\n (3) Was John at the party last night or not at the party last night?\n\n== In Sinitic ==\n\n=== NQ Morpheme ===\nIt is proposed that the A-not-A sequence is morpheme created by the reduplication of the interrogative morpheme (represented by the A in A-not-A).<ref name=\":5\" /> Though the specific syntactic location of this morpheme is not agreed upon, it is generally accepted that the A-not-A sequence is essentially a word formed by the concatenation of an abstract question morpheme and this duplicated predicate, which likens it to a VP-proclitic. This Morpheme is referred to as NQ in order to represent its character as negative and interrogative.\n\n=== Similarity to kam-type questions ===\nAn extensive cross-dialectic survey conducted in 1985 concluded that the Taiwanese question particle kam appears in the same contexts as the hypothesized Mandarin NQ.<ref name=\":4\" /> From this, it was concluded that kam-type questions and A-not-A questions are in complementary distribution: a language either has kam-type questions or A-not-A questions but not both. It was also interpreted that kam and NQ are \"different morphological exponents of the same underlying morpheme\".<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Movement, sensitivity, and parallels to weishenme 'why' ===\nUnlike the yes/no question type formed using the segment \"ma\", the A-not-A question can be embedded, and may scope beyond its own clause. This scoping may be blocked if the original location of NQ and its intended final location are separated by an [[Island (linguistics)|island]] boundary.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=HUANG|first=C.

A is essentially a variable which can be replaced with a grammatical particle such as a [[Modal verb|modal]], adverb, adjective, verb, or preposition.\n\n==== Patterns ====\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], there are 6 attested patterns of A-not-A: A-not-A, AB-not-AB, A-not-AB, AB-not-A, a-not-A, and a-not-AB of which \"A\" stands for the full form of the predicate, \"B\" stands for the complement, and \"a\" stands for the first syllable of a disyllabic predicate.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|last=Clare|first=Li|date=2017|title=The syntactic and pragmatic properties of a-not-a question in Chinese |hdl=10092/13628}}</ref>\n\n===== A-not-A form<ref name=\":1\" />=====\nExample (3) illustrates that A-not-A pattern, where A is the verb {{transl|cmn|qu}} 'go', and {{transl|cmn|qu bu qu}} is 'go not go'.\n          (3) \u4f60  '''\u53bb'''  \u4e0d  '''\u53bb'''\uff1f       \n              {{transl|cmn|ni  '''qu'''  bu  '''qu'''}}      \n              you '''go'''  not '''go'''    \n              Are you going?\n\n===== AB-not-AB form<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=L\u00fc|date=1985|title=\u7591\u6587 \u5426\u5b9a \u80af\u5b9a Yiwen, Fouding, Kending (Questioning, Negation, Affirmation)|url=|journal=\u4e2d\u570b\u8a9e\u6587 Zhongguo Yuwen|volume=4|pages=241\u2013250|via=}}</ref>=====\nExample (4) illustrates the AB-not-AB pattern, where AB is the constituent consisting of the verb {{transl|cmn|rende}}, 'know', as A, and the complement ''{{transl|cmn|zhe ge ren}}'', 'this CL man', as B, combining to form the AB constituent ''{{transl|cmn|rende zhe ge ren}}'' 'know this CL man'.

First, the A-not-A operator targets the [[morphosyntactic]] word (MWd) which is the head that is closest to it and undergoes lowering. Then, [[reduplication]] occurs to yield the surface form of the A-not-A question.<ref name=tseng>Tseng, W. H. K., & Lin, T. H. J. (2009). A Post-Syntactic Approach to the A-not-A Questions. UST Working Papers in Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 107-139.</ref>\n\n[[File:MWd vs SWd.png|thumb|Syntactic distinctions between morphosyntactic words (MWd) and subwords (SWd)]]\n\nTseng suggests that A-not-A occurs post-syntactically, at the morphological level. It is movement that occurs overtly at the [[Phonetics|phonetic]] form, after the syntactic movement has occurred. A-not-A is a feature of T that operates on the closest, c-commanded MWd, and not subwords (SWd). The elements that undergo post-syntactic movement are MWds. A node X  is a MWd iff X is the highest segment and X is not contained in another X. A node X is a SWd if X  is a terminal node and not an MWd.<ref name=tseng /> The A-not-A operation is a MWd to MWd movement.\n\n===Conditional criteria for grammatical A-not-A question derivation===\n\n====A-not-A operator lowering====\nThe A-not-A operator is defined as an MWd. The A-not-A operator can only lower to a MWd which is immediately dominated by the [[Government and binding theory#Government|maximal projection]] that is also immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. An SWd cannot be the target for the A-not-A operator. In addition, if there is an intervening MWd or SWd between the A-not-A operator and its target, the A-not-A operation fails.<ref name=tseng />\n\nA-not-A operator lowering must satisfy four conditions:\n\n# The A-not-A operator targets the closest MWd that is the [[X-bar theory|X\u2032-theoretic head]] that it [[c-command]]s.\n# Closeness of the head is qualified by: (i) The closest head is a X\u2032-theoretic head of the maximal which is immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. (ii) The target must have overt phonological realization. \n# There is not any non-X\u2032-theoretic head or SWd intervening between the A-not-A operator and its target. \n# Intervention is defined by c-command relation.\n\n[[File:Grammatical a-not-a lowering, xihuan Lisi.png|thumb|right|Grammatical A-not-A operator lowering to adjacent MWd verb ''xihuan''.

Even though ''hen'' is the closest adjacent MWd, it is not an X\u2019-theoretical head, thus lowering to it violates A-not-A lowering conditions]]\n\nAfter lowering, the A-not-A operator triggers [[reduplication]] on the target node. The reduplication domain can be the first syllable of the targeted element, the targeted element itself, and the [[Government and binding theory#Government|maximal projection]] that contains the targeted element. Reduplication is linear and the A-not-A operator cannot skip the adjacent constituent to copy the next constituent.<ref name=tseng />\n\n====Reduplication of first syllable of adjacent morphosyntactic word====\nIn first syllable reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable of the adjacent MWd and moves the [[reduplicant]], i.e. copied syllable, to the left of the base MWd. Then the negation is inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (33.a), the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable {{transl|zh|tao}} of the MWd {{transl|zh|taoyan}}. The reduplicant {{transl|zh|tao}} is put at the left of the base {{transl|zh|taoyan}} and then the negative constituent {{transl|zh|bu}} is inserted in between. In figure (33.b) {{transl|zh|*Zhangsan taoyan Lisi-bu-tao}} is ungrammatical because {{transl|zh|tao}} cannot be put to the right of the maximal projection VP, {{transl|zh|taoyan Lisi}}.\n\n          (33.a) \u5f20\u4e09     '''\u8ba8'''\u4e0d'''\u8ba8'''\u538c     \u674e\u65af\n                {{transl|zh| Zhangsan '''tao'''-bu-'''tao'''yan Lisi}}\n                Zhangsan '''hate'''-not-'''hate''' Lisi\n                Does Zhangsan hate Lisi or not?<ref name=tseng />\n \n          (33.b)*\u5f20\u4e09     '''\u8ba8'''\u538c    \u674e\u65af\u4e0d'''\u8ba8'''\n               {{transl|zh|*Zhangsan '''tao'''yan Lisi-bu-'''tao'''}}\n                Zhangsan hate   Lisi-not-hate<ref name=tseng />\n\n====Reduplication of adjacent morphosyntactic word====\nIn MWd reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant MWd overtly to the left of the base MWd or to right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd.

{"title_page": "Classical Nahuatl grammar", "text_new": "The '''[[grammar]] of [[Classical Nahuatl]]''' is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]],  [[Head-marking language|head-marking]], and makes extensive use of compounding, [[noun incorporation]] and derivation. That is, it can add many different [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es to a root until very long words are formed. Very long verbal forms or nouns created by incorporation, and accumulation of prefixes are common in literary works. New words can thus be easily created.\n\n== Orthography used in this article==\nVowel length was phonologically distinctive in Classical Nahuatl, but vowel length was rarely transcribed in manuscripts, leading to occasional difficulties in discerning whether a given vowel was long or short. In this article, long vowels are indicated with a macron above the vowel letter: <\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d>. Another feature which is rarely marked in manuscripts is the [[Saltillo (linguistics)|saltillo]] or [[glottal stop]] ([\u0294]). In this article, the ''saltillo'' is indicated with an ''h'' following a vowel. The grammarian [[Horacio Carochi]] (1645) represented ''saltillo'' by marking diacritics on the preceding vowel: grave accent on nonfinal vowels <\u00e0, \u00ec, \u00e8, \u00f2> and circumflex on final vowels <\u00e2, \u00ee, \u00ea, \u00f4>. Carochi is almost alone among colonial-era grammarians in consistently representing both ''saltillo'' and vowel length in transcription, even though they are both essential to a proper understanding of Classical Nahuatl.\n\n==Morphophonology==\nThe phonological shapes of Nahuatl [[morpheme]]s may be altered in particular contexts, depending on the shape of the adjacent morphemes or their position in the word.\n\n===Assimilation===\nWhere a morpheme ending in a consonant is followed by a morpheme beginning in a consonant, one of the two consonants often undergoes [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], adopting features of the other consonant.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| ch\n! +\n| y\n! \u2192\n| chch\n|style=\"text-align: left\"| E.g.

''m\u0101huiz-(tli)'' \"fear\" + ''-y\u014d-(tl)'' \"-ness\" \u2192 ''m\u0101huizz\u014dtl'' \"respect\"\n|}\nAlmost all doubled consonants in Nahuatl are produced by the assimilation of two different consonants from different morphemes. Doubled consonants within a single morpheme are rare, a notable example being the verb ''-itta'' \"see\", and possibly indicates a fossilized double morpheme.\n\n==Morphology==\nThe words of Nahuatl can be divided into three basic functional classes: verbs, nouns and particles. Adjectives exist, but they generally behave like nouns and there are very few adjectives that are not derived from either verbal or nominal roots. The few adverbs that can be said to exist fall into the class of particles.\n\n===Nouns===\nIn Classical Nahuatl, nouns can act as verbs, meaning 'to be X', by simply inflecting it as a verb.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lockhart |first1=James |title=Nahuatl as Written |publisher=Stanford UP}}</ref>\n\nExample: ''ti'' + ''amolnamacac'' 'soap seller', becomes ''tamolnamacac'', meaning 'you are a soap seller'\n(See verb inflection below).\n\nThe noun is inflected for two basic contrasting categories:\n\n*possessedness: non-possessed contrasts with possessed\n*number: singular contrasts with plural\n\n\nNouns belong to one of two classes: animates or inanimates. Originally the grammatical distinction between these were that inanimate nouns had no plural forms, but in most modern dialects both animate and inanimate nouns are pluralizable.\n\nNominal morphology is mostly suffixing. Some irregular formations exist.\n\n====Possessedness====\nNon-possessed nouns take a [[Affix|suffix]] called the ''absolutive''. This suffix takes the form ''-tl'' after vowels (''\u0101-tl'', \"water\") and ''-tli'' after consonants, which [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] with a final /l/ on the root (''t\u014dch-tli'', \"rabbit\", but ''cal-li'', \"house\"). Some nouns have an irregular form in ''-in'' (''mich-in'', fish). These suffixes are dropped in most derived forms: ''t\u014dch-cal-li'', \"rabbit-hole\", ''mich-matla-tl'', \"fishing net\". Possessed nouns do not take the absolutive suffix (see [[#Noun_inflection|Noun inflection]] below), but do receive a prefix to denote the possessor.\n\n====Number====\n\n*The absolutive singular suffix has three basic forms: ''-tl/tli, -lin/-in'', and some irregular nouns with no suffix.\n*The absolutive plural suffix has three basic forms: ''-tin'', ''-meh'', or just a final glottal stop ''-h''. Some plurals are formed also with reduplication of the noun's first or second syllable, with the reduplicated vowel [[vowel length|long]].\n*The possessive singular suffix has two basic forms: ''-uh'' (on stems ending in a vowel) or -\u00d8 (on stems ending in a consonant).\n*The possessive plural suffix has the form ''-hu\u0101n''.\n\nOnly animate nouns can take a plural form. These include most animate living beings, but also words like ''tep\u0113tl'' (\"mountain\"), ''citl\u0101lin'' (\"star\") and some other phenomena.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Possible plurals combination\n|-\n!\n!-h\n!-tin\n!-meh\n|-\n!With<br />reduplication\n|te\u014dtl, t\u0113teoh\n|t\u014dchtli, t\u014dt\u014dchtin\n|Never occurs\n|-\n!Without<br />reduplication\n|cihu\u0101tl, cihu\u0101h\n|oquichtli, oquichtin\n|michin, michmeh\n|}\n\nThe plural is not totally stable and in many cases several different forms are attested.\n\n====Noun inflection====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Absolutive singular\n|''cihu\u0101tl'' \"woman, wife\"\n|''oquichtli'' \"man, husband\"\n|''tot\u014dlin'' \"turkey\"\n|''tl\u0101catl'' \"person (sg.)\"\n|-\n|-\n!Absolutive Plural\n|''cihu\u0101h'' \"women\"\n|''oquichtin'' \"men\"\n|''tot\u014dlmeh'' \"turkeys\"\n|''tlatl\u0101cah'' \"people\"\n|-\n|-\n!Possessed Singular\n|''nocihu\u0101uh'' \"my wife\"\n|''noquich'' \"my husband\"\n|''notot\u014dl'' \"my turkey\"\n|''notl\u0101cauh'' \"my person (ie. my slave)\"\n|-\n|-\n!Possessed Plural\n|''nocihu\u0101hu\u0101n'' \"my wives\"\n|''noquichhu\u0101n'' \"my husbands\"\n|''notot\u014dlhu\u0101n'' \"my turkeys\"\n|''notl\u0101cahu\u0101n'' \"my slaves\"\n|-\n|}\n\n====Possessor prefixes====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!1st person singular \n|''no-'', 'my'\n|-\n|-\n!2nd person singular \n|''mo-'', 'your'\n|-\n|-\n!3rd person singular \n|''\u012b-'', 'his, hers, its\n|-\n|-\n!1st person plural \n|''to-'', 'our'\n|-\n|-\n!2nd person plural \n|''amo-'', 'your'\n|-\n|-\n!3rd person plural \n|''\u012bn-/\u012bm-'', 'their'\n|-\n|-\n!Unknown possessor \n|''t\u0113-'', 'their' (somebody's)\n|}\n\nExample: ''nocal'', 'my house'\n\nIf a given prefix ends with a vowel (apart from 3rd person singular), that vowel may be elided depending on the following sound. The vowel will only be elided if the word's stem begins with a \"stronger\" vowel.  Generally, the heirarchy of vowels, from strongest to weakest, is a/e, o, i.\n\nExample: ''to'' + ''amolli'', becomes ''tamol'', meaning 'our soap'\n\nSome other categories can be inflected on the noun such as: \n: Honorific formed with the suffix ''-tzin''.\n: ''cihu\u0101-tl'' 'woman' + ''tzin'' + ''tli'' absolutive, becomes ''cihu\u0101tzintli'', 'woman (said with respect)'\n\n====Inalienable possession====\nThe suffix ''-yo'' \u2014 the same suffix as the abstract/collective ''-y\u014d(tl)'' \u2014 may be added to a possessed noun to indicate that it is a part of its possessor, rather than just being owned by it. For example, both ''nonac'' and ''nonacayo'' (possessed forms of ''nacatl'') mean \"my meat\", but ''nonac'' may refer to meat that one has to eat, while ''nonacayo'' refers to the flesh that makes up one's body. This is known as '''inalienable''', '''integral''' or '''organic possession'''.<ref>Andrews (2003): pp. 382\u2013384; Carochi (2001): pp. 308\u2013309; Lockhart (2001): pp. 69\u201370.</ref>\n{{see also|Inalienable possession}}\n\n====Derivational morphology====\n*''-tia'' derives from noun X a verb with an approximate meaning of \"to provide with X \" or \"to become X.\"\n*''-huia'' derives from noun X a verb with an approximate meaning of \"to use X \" or \"to provide with X.\"\n*''-y\u014dtl'' derives from a noun X  a noun with an abstract meaning of \"X-hood or X-ness.\"\n*''-yoh'' derives from a noun X a noun with a meaning of \"thing full of X\" or \"thing with a lot of X.\"\n\n=== Verbs ===\n\nAll verbs are marked with prefixes in order to agree with the person of the subject, and, where there is one, the object. In addition, verbs take a special suffix to mark plural subjects (only animates take plural agreement).\n\nAn example of an intransitive verb, with subject marking: ''niy\u014dli'' 'I live,' ''tiy\u014dli'' 'you (singular) live,' ''y\u014dli'' he, she, it lives,' ''tiy\u014dlih'' 'we live,' ''any\u014dlih'' 'you (plural) live,' ''y\u014dlih'' 'they live.'\n\n====Subject and object marking====\n\nThe person prefixes are identical for all tenses and moods (with the exception of the imperative, whose prefix is ''x(i)-''), but the plural number suffix varies according to tense or mood. In the table below, ''\u00d8-'' indicates there is no prefix.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Subject\n!Marking\n!Notes\n!Examples\n|-\n!1st person singular\n|''ni-'', 'I'\n|''n-'' before a vowel\n|''nicu\u012bca'' 'I sing,' ''n\u0113hua'' 'I depart' \n|-\n!2nd person singular\n|''ti-'', 'you'\n|''t-'' before a vowel\n|''ticu\u012bca'' 'you sing,' ''t\u0113hua'' 'you depart'  \n|-\n!3rd person singular\n|''\u00d8-'', 'he, she, it' \n|always zero\n|''cu\u012bca'' 'he/she/it sings,' ''\u0113hua'' 'he/she/it departs'  \n|-\n!1st person plural \n|''ti-'' (verb) + plural suffix, 'we' \n|''t-'' before a vowel\n|''ticu\u012bcah'' 'we sing,' ''t\u0113huah'' 'we depart'  \n|-\n!2nd person plural\n|''an-'' (verb) + plural suffix 'you' \n|''am-'' before a vowel, ''m'' or ''p''\n|''ancu\u012bcah'' 'you sing,' ''am\u0113huah'' 'you depart'  \n|-\n!3rd person plural \n|''\u00d8-'' (verb) + plural suffix, 'they' \n|only with animates\n|''cu\u012bcah'' 'they sing,' ''\u0113huah'' 'they depart' \n|-\n!Imperative singular\n|''xi-'', 'you'\n|''x-'' before a vowel\n|''xicu\u012bca'' 'sing!'

If the object is unknown or is simply 'things/people in general' the unspecified object prefixes may be used. Compare ''niccua'' 'I am eating it (ie. something specific)' to ''nitlacua'' 'I am eating'.\n\nPlural suffixes are never used to mark plural objects, only plural subjects. Unspecified objects are never plural.\n\nA Classical Nahuatl verb thus has the following structure:\n\nSUBJECT PREFIX + OBJECT PREFIX + VERB STEM + SUBJECT NUMBER (example: ''ti-quim-itta-h'', we - them - see - plural, i.e., 'we see them')\n\nDirect arguments of the verb - that is, subject and object - are obligatorily marked on the verb. If there are both direct and indirect objects (which are not morphologically distinguished), only one may be marked on the verb.\n\nOther inflectional categories may be optionally marked, for example direction of motion. Other inflections include the [[applicative voice|applicative]] and [[causative]], both [[valency (linguistics)|valency]] changing operations; that is, they increase the number of arguments associated with a verb, transforming an intransitive verb into transitive, or a transitive verb into bitransitive.\n\n====Tense and mood inflection====\n\nThe different tenses and moods are formed, somewhat as in Latin or Ancient Greek, by adding the person inflections to the appropriate verbal base or stem.\n\nThe '''present''' tense is formed from base 1, the normal or [[Lemma (morphology)|citation form]] of the verb (also known as the imperfective stem), with no special suffixes. The plural subject suffix is ''-h''. Examples: ''nicochi'' 'I am sleeping,' ''tlahtoah'' 'they are speaking,' ''nicch\u012bhua'' 'I am making it.'\n\nThe '''preterite''' or perfect tense is similar in meaning to the English simple past or present perfect. It is formed using base 2. The singular often ends in ''-h'' or ''-c'' while the plural suffix is ''-queh.''\n\nThe formation of base 2, also known as the perfective stem, depends on the specific verb, but is usually shorter in form than base 1, often dropping a final vowel.\n\nThe preterite is often accompanied by the prefix ''\u014d-'' (sometimes called the augment, or antecessive prefix). The function of this prefix is to mark that the action of the verb is complete at the time of speaking (or in a subordinate clause, at the time of the action described by the main verb). The augment is frequently absent in mythic or historical narratives. Examples: ''\u014dnicoch'' 'I slept,' ''\u014dtlatohqueh'' 'they spoke,' ''\u014dnicch\u012buh'' 'I made it.' The preterite also can be used to create agentive constructions\n\nThe '''pluperfect''' is also formed with the use of base 2 and the augment, but with the suffix ''-ca'' in the singular and ''-cah'' in the plural. The pluperfect roughly corresponds with the English past perfect, although more precisely it indicates that a particular action or state was in effect in the past but that it has been undone or reversed at the time of speaking. Examples: ''\u014dnicochca'' 'I had slept,' ''\u014dtlatohcah'' 'they had spoken,' ''\u014dnicch\u012buhca'' 'I had made it.'\n\nThe '''imperfect''' is similar in meaning to the imperfect in the [[Romance languages]]. It is formed with base 1, plus ''-ya'' or ''-yah'' in the plural. Sometimes the final vowel of the stem is lengthened. Examples: ''nicochiya'' 'I was sleeping,' ''tlahto\u0101yah'' 'they used to speak,' ''nicch\u012bhuaya'' 'I was making it.'\n\nThe '''habitual present''' or '''customary present''' or '''quotidian''' tense is formed from base 1. The suffix is ''-ni'', with the stem vowels sometimes lengthened before it. Rather than one specific event this tense expresses the subject's tendency or propensity to repeatedly or habitually perform the same action over time (e.g. ''miquini'' 'mortal,' lit. '(one who is) prone to die'. It is frequently translated into English with a noun or noun phrase, for example: ''cu\u012bcani'' 'one who sings, singer,' ''tlahcuilo\u0101ni'' (from ''ihcuiloa'' 'write, paint') 'scribe,' or '[[tlatoani|tlahto\u0101ni]]' (from ''ihtoa'' 'speak') the title for the ruler of a Mexica city. Plural formation of this form is variable. It can be in ''-nih'' or ''-nimeh.'' In some cases, the plural does not use ''-ni'' at all but instead a preterite ending, as with ''tlahtohqueh,'' the plural of ''tlahto\u0101ni,'' or ''tlahcuilohqueh,'' the plural of ''tlahcuilo\u0101ni.'' These preterite forms are also used to create possessive forms.\n\nThe '''future''' tense is formed from base 3, with a suffix ''-z'' in the singular and ''-zqueh'' in the plural.\n\nBase 3 is normally the same as base 1, except for verbs whose stem ending in two vowels, in which case the second vowel is dropped, and the stem vowel is often lengthened in front of a suffix. Examples of the future: ''nicochiz'' 'I will sleep,' ''tlaht\u014dzqueh'' 'they will speak,' ''nicch\u012bhuaz'' 'I will make it.'\n\nThe '''imperative''' and '''[[optative]]''' are likewise formed from base 3, but with the plural suffix ''-c\u0101n.'' The imperative uses the special imperative subject prefixes, available only in the second person; the optative uses the normal subject prefixes (effectively it is the same mood, but outside of the second person). The imperative is used for commands, the optative is used for wishes or desires, both used in conjunction with particles: ''m\u0101 nicch\u012bhua'' 'let me make it!'\n\nThe '''conditional,''' '''irrealis''' or '''counterfactual''' are all names for the same verbal mood formed from base 3. The suffix is ''-zquiya'' (sometimes spelled ''-zquia)'' in the singular and ''-zquiyah'' in the plural. The basic meaning is that a state or action that was intended or desired did not come to pass. It can be translated as 'would have,' 'almost,' etc. Examples: ''nicochizquiya'' 'I would have slept,' ''tlaht\u014dzquiyah'' 'they would have spoken,' ''nicch\u012bhuazquiya'' 'I would have made it.'\n\nThe final mood is sometimes called as '''vetitive''' (that is, issuing a prohibition), or '''negative imperative''' (equivalent to English 'don't...') but this is not the proper sense. Another way to describe it is '''admonitive''' - issuing a warning that something may come to pass, which the speaker does not desire, and by implication steps should be taken to avoid this (compare the English conjunction ''lest''). The negative of this mood simply warns that something may not happen and this non-occurrence is not desirable. The mood is formed with base 2, the same as the preterite, but with different endings. If the preterite singular ends in ''-c'' this is replaced by the glottal stop/saltillo. In the plural the ending is ''-(h)tin'' or ''-(h)tih''. The admonitive is used in conjunction with particles ''m\u0101'' or ''n\u0113n.'' Examples: ''m\u0101 nicoch'' 'be careful, lest I sleep,' ''m\u0101 tlatohtin'' 'watch out, they may speak,' ''m\u0101 nicch\u012buh'' 'don't let me make it.'\n\n====Applicative====\nThe applicative construction adds an argument to the verb. The role of the added argument can be benefactive, malefactive, indirect object or similar. It is formed by the suffix ''-lia''.\n*''niquittilia'' \"I see it for him\"\n\n====Causative====\nThe causative construction also adds an argument to the verb. This argument is an agent causing the object to undertake the action of the verb. It is formed by the suffix ''-tia''.\n*''niquittatia''  \"I make him see it/I show it to him\"\n\n====Unspecified Subject/Passive====\nThe construction, called \"passive\" by some grammarians and \"unspecified subject construction\" by others, removes the subject from the valency of the verb, substituting it with a null reference, and promoting the argument marked by object prefixes to subject. The passive or unspecified subject construction uses one of two suffixes: ''-lo'' or ''-hua''.\n*quitta \"he sees it\"+ ''-lo''= ''quittalo'' \"it is seen (by someone)\"\n*miqui \"he dies\" + hua = ''micohua'' \"there is dying/people are dying\"\n\n====Directional affixes====\nDeixis:\n*''-on-''  \"away from the speaker\"\n*''on''+ ''tlahtoa'' \"to speak\" = ''ontlahtoa'' \"he/she/it speaks towards there\"\n*''-hu\u0101l-'' \" towards the speaker\"\n*''hu\u0101l''+ ''tlahtoa'' \"to speak\" =  ''hu\u0101llahtoa'' \"he/she/it speaks towards here\"\n\nIntrovert: \nImperfective: ''-qui '' \"comes towards the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + qui =\"''quittaqui'' \"he/she/it will come here to see it\" \nPerfective: ''-co''  \"has come towards the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + ''co'' =''quittaco'' \"he/she/it has come here to see it\"\n\nExtrovert:\nImperfective: ''-t\u012buh'' \"goes away from the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + t\u012buh =\"''quittat\u012buh'' \"he/she/it will go there to see it\" \nPerfective: ''-to'' \" has gone away from the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + ''to'' =''quittato'' \"he/she/it has gone there to see it\"\n\n====Derivational====\nA number of different suffixes exist to derive nouns from verbs:\n\n*''-lli'' used to derive passivized nouns from verbs.\n''tla'' \"something\" + ''ixca'' \"roast\" + ''l'' + ''tli'' = ''tlaxcalli'' \"something roasted/ a tortilla\"<br />\n''tla'' + ''ihcuiloa'' \"write/draw\" + ''l'' - ''tli'' = ''tlahcuilolli'' \"scripture/ a drawing\"\n\n*''-liztli''  used to derive abstract nouns from verbs.\n''miqui'' \"to die\" + ''liztli'' = ''miquiliztli'' \"death\"<br />\n''tlahcuiloa'' \"to write something\" +'' liztli ''= ''tlahcuiloliztli'' \"the concept of writing or being a scribe\"\n\n*''-qui'' used to derive agentive nouns from verbs.\n''ichtequi'' \"to steal\" + ''qui'' = ''ichtecqui'' \"a thief\"<br />\n''tlahu\u0101na'' \"to become drunk\" + ''qui'' = ''tlahu\u0101nqui'' \"a drunkard\"\n\n====Verbal compounds====\nTwo verbs can be compounded with the ligature morpheme ''-ti-''.\n\n====Relational Nouns and Locatives====\nSpatial and other relations are expressed with [[relational noun]]s. Some locative suffixes also exist.\n\n====Noun Incorporation====\nNoun [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] is productive in Classical Nahuatl and different kinds of material can be incorporated.\n*Body parts\n*Instruments\n*Objects\n\n==Syntax==\nThe particle ''in'' is important in Nahuatl syntax and is used as a kind of [[definite article]] and also as a subordinating particle and a deictic particle, in addition to having other functions.\n\n===Non-configurationality===\nClassical Nahuatl can be classified as a non-configurational language, allowing many different kinds of word orders, even splitting noun phrases.\n\n===VSO basic word order===\nThe basic word order of Classical Nahuatl is verb initial and often considered to be VSO, but some scholars have argued for it being VOS. However, the language being non-configurational, all word orders are allowed and are used to express different kinds of pragmatic relations, such as thematization and focus.\n\n===Nouns as predicates===\n\nAn important feature of Classical Nahuatl is that any noun can function as a standalone [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. For example, ''calli'' is commonly translated \"house\" but could also be translated \"(it) is a house\".\n\nAs predicates, nouns can take the verbal subject prefixes (but not tense inflection). Thus, ''nit\u0113uctli'' means \"I am a lord\" with the regular first person singular subject ''ni-'' attached to the noun ''t\u0113uctli'' \"lord\". Similarly ''tinocihu\u0101uh'' means \"you are my wife\", with the possessive noun ''nocihu\u0101uh'' \"my wife\" attached to the subject prefix ''ti-'' \"you\" (singular). This construction is also seen in the name ''T\u012btl\u0101cahu\u0101n'' meaning \"we are his slaves\", a name for the god [[Tezcatlipoca]].\n\n==Number system==\n[[Image:Pohualli.jpg|frame|right|<center>20</center>]]\n[[Image:Tzontli.jpg|frame|right|<center>400</center>]]\n[[Image:Xiquipilli.jpg|frame|right|<center>8000</center>]]\nClassical Nahuatl has a [[vigesimal]] or [[base 20]] number system.<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 307.</ref> In the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Aztec writing|Nahuatl script]], the numbers 20, 400 (20<sup>2</sup>) and 8,000 (20<sup>3</sup>) were represented by a flag, a feather, and a bag, respectively.\n\nIt also makes use of [[numeral classifiers]], similar to languages such as [[Chinese classifier|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].\n\n===Basic numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| 1 || c\u0113 || Becomes ''cem-'' or ''cen-'' when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 2 || \u014dme || Becomes ''\u014dm-'' or ''\u014dn-'' when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 3 || \u0113yi/y\u0113i/\u0113i/y\u0113yi || Becomes ''(y)\u0113-'' or ''(y)\u0113x-'' when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 4 || n\u0101hui || Becomes ''n\u0101hu-/n\u0101uh-'' (i.e. {{IPA|/na\u02d0w/}}) when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 5 || m\u0101cu\u012blli || Derived from ''m\u0101itl'' \"hand\".<ref>Andrews (2003): pp. 309\u2013310.</ref>\n|-\n| 6 || chicuac\u0113 || ''chicua-'' \"5\" + ''c\u0113'' \"1\"\n|-\n| 7 || chic\u014dme || ''chic-'' \"5\" + ''\u014dme'' \"2\"\n|-\n| 8 || chicu\u0113yi || ''chicu-'' \"5\" + ''\u0113i'' \"3\"\n|-\n| 9 || chiucn\u0101hui || ''chiuc-'' \"5\" + ''n\u0101hui'' \"4\"\n|-\n| 10 || mahtl\u0101ctli || From ''m\u0101itl'' \"hand\" + ''tl\u0101ctli'' \"torso\".<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 310.</ref>\n|-\n| 15 || caxt\u014dlli ||\n|-\n| 20 || c\u0113mp\u014dhualli || From ''c\u0113m-'' \"1\" + ''p\u014dhualli'' \"a count\" (from ''p\u014dhua'' \"to count\").<ref name=\"a311\">Andrews (2003): p. 311.</ref>\n|-\n| 400 || c\u0113ntzontli || From ''c\u0113n-'' \"1\" + ''tzontli'' \"hair\".<ref name=\"a311\"/>\n|-\n| 8000 || c\u0113nxiquipilli || From ''c\u0113n-'' \"1\" + ''xiquipilli'' \"bag\".<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 312.</ref>\n|}\n\n===Compound numbers===\nMultiples of 20, 400 or 8,000 are formed by replacing ''c\u0113m-'' or ''c\u0113n-'' with another number.

The smaller number is prefixed with ''om-'' or ''on-'', or in the case of larger units, preceded by ''\u012bpan'' \"on it\" or ''\u012bhu\u0101n'' \"with it\". E.g.

That is, it can add many different [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es to a root until very long words are formed. Very long verbal forms or nouns created by incorporation, and accumulation of prefixes are common in literary works. New words can thus be easily created.\n\n== Orthography used in this article==\nVowel length was phonologically distinctive in Classical Nahuatl, but vowel length was rarely transcribed in manuscripts, leading to occasional difficulties in discerning whether a given vowel was long or short. In this article, long vowels are indicated with a macron above the vowel letter: <\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d>. Another feature which is rarely marked in manuscripts is the [[Saltillo (linguistics)|saltillo]] or [[glottal stop]] ([\u0294]). In this article, the ''saltillo'' is indicated with an ''h'' following a vowel. The grammarian [[Horacio Carochi]] (1645) represented ''saltillo'' by marking diacritics on the preceding vowel: grave accent on nonfinal vowels <\u00e0, \u00ec, \u00e8, \u00f2> and circumflex on final vowels <\u00e2, \u00ee, \u00ea, \u00f4>. Carochi is almost alone among colonial-era grammarians in consistently representing both ''saltillo'' and vowel length in transcription, even though they are both essential to a proper understanding of Classical Nahuatl.\n\n==Morphophonology==\nThe phonological shapes of Nahuatl [[morpheme]]s may be altered in particular contexts, depending on the shape of the adjacent morphemes or their position in the word.\n\n===Assimilation===\nWhere a morpheme ending in a consonant is followed by a morpheme beginning in a consonant, one of the two consonants often undergoes [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], adopting features of the other consonant.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| ch\n! +\n| y\n! \u2192\n| chch\n|style=\"text-align: left\"| E.g.

''m\u0101huiz-(tli)'' \"fear\" + ''-y\u014d-(tl)'' \"-ness\" \u2192 ''m\u0101huizz\u014dtl'' \"respect\"\n|}\nAlmost all doubled consonants in Nahuatl are produced by the assimilation of two different consonants from different morphemes. Doubled consonants within a single morpheme are rare, a notable example being the verb ''-itta'' \"see\", and possibly indicates a fossilized double morpheme.\n\n==Morphology==\nThe words of Nahuatl can be divided into three basic functional classes: verbs, nouns and particles. Adjectives exist, but they generally behave like nouns and there are very few adjectives that are not derived from either verbal or nominal roots. The few adverbs that can be said to exist fall into the class of particles.\n\n===Nouns===\nIn Classical Nahuatl, nouns can act as verbs, meaning 'to be X', by simply inflecting it as a verb.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lockhart |first1=James |title=Nahuatl as Written |publisher=Stanford UP}}</ref>\n\nExample: ''ti'' + ''amolnamacac'' 'soap seller', becomes ''tamolnamacac'', meaning 'you are a soap seller'\n(See verb inflection below).\n\nThe noun is inflected for two basic contrasting categories:\n\n*possessedness: non-possessed contrasts with possessed\n*number: singular contrasts with plural\n\n\nNouns belong to one of two classes: animates or inanimates. Originally the grammatical distinction between these were that inanimate nouns had no plural forms, but in most modern dialects both animate and inanimate nouns are pluralizable.\n\nNominal morphology is mostly suffixing. Some irregular formations exist.\n\n====Possessedness====\nNon-possessed nouns take a [[Affix|suffix]] called the ''absolutive''. This suffix takes the form ''-tl'' after vowels (''\u0101-tl'', \"water\") and ''-tli'' after consonants, which [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] with a final /l/ on the root (''t\u014dch-tli'', \"rabbit\", but ''cal-li'', \"house\"). Some nouns have an irregular form in ''-in'' (''mich-in'', fish). These suffixes are dropped in most derived forms: ''t\u014dch-cal-li'', \"rabbit-hole\", ''mich-matla-tl'', \"fishing net\". Possessed nouns do not take the absolutive suffix (see [[#Noun_inflection|Noun inflection]] below), but do receive a prefix to denote the possessor.\n\n====Number====\n\n*The absolutive singular suffix has three basic forms: ''-tl/tli, -lin/-in'', and some irregular nouns with no suffix.\n*The absolutive plural suffix has three basic forms: ''-tin'', ''-meh'', or just a final glottal stop ''-h''. Some plurals are formed also with reduplication of the noun's first or second syllable, with the reduplicated vowel [[vowel length|long]].\n*The possessive singular suffix has two basic forms: ''-uh'' (on stems ending in a vowel) or -\u00d8 (on stems ending in a consonant).\n*The possessive plural suffix has the form ''-hu\u0101n''.\n\nOnly animate nouns can take a plural form. These include most animate living beings, but also words like ''tep\u0113tl'' (\"mountain\"), ''citl\u0101lin'' (\"star\") and some other phenomena.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Possible plurals combination\n|-\n!\n!-h\n!-tin\n!-meh\n|-\n!With<br />reduplication\n|te\u014dtl, t\u0113teoh\n|t\u014dchtli, t\u014dt\u014dchtin\n|Never occurs\n|-\n!Without<br />reduplication\n|cihu\u0101tl, cihu\u0101h\n|oquichtli, oquichtin\n|michin, michmeh\n|}\n\nThe plural is not totally stable and in many cases several different forms are attested.\n\n====Noun inflection====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Absolutive singular\n|''cihu\u0101tl'' \"woman, wife\"\n|''oquichtli'' \"man, husband\"\n|''tot\u014dlin'' \"turkey\"\n|''tl\u0101catl'' \"person (sg.)\"\n|-\n|-\n!Absolutive Plural\n|''cihu\u0101h'' \"women\"\n|''oquichtin'' \"men\"\n|''tot\u014dlmeh'' \"turkeys\"\n|''tlatl\u0101cah'' \"people\"\n|-\n|-\n!Possessed Singular\n|''nocihu\u0101uh'' \"my wife\"\n|''noquich'' \"my husband\"\n|''notot\u014dl'' \"my turkey\"\n|''notl\u0101cauh'' \"my person (ie. my slave)\"\n|-\n|-\n!Possessed Plural\n|''nocihu\u0101hu\u0101n'' \"my wives\"\n|''noquichhu\u0101n'' \"my husbands\"\n|''notot\u014dlhu\u0101n'' \"my turkeys\"\n|''notl\u0101cahu\u0101n'' \"my slaves\"\n|-\n|}\n\n====Possessor prefixes====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!1st person singular \n|''no-'', 'my'\n|-\n|-\n!2nd person singular \n|''mo-'', 'your'\n|-\n|-\n!3rd person singular \n|''\u012b-'', 'his, hers, its\n|-\n|-\n!1st person plural \n|''to-'', 'our'\n|-\n|-\n!2nd person plural \n|''amo-'', 'your'\n|-\n|-\n!3rd person plural \n|''\u012bn-/\u012bm-'', 'their'\n|-\n|-\n!Unknown possessor \n|''t\u0113-'', 'their' (somebody's)\n|}\n\nExample: ''nocal'', 'my house'\n\nIf a given prefix ends with a vowel (apart from 3rd person singular), that vowel may be elided depending on the following sound. The vowel will only be elided if the word's stem begins with a \"stronger\" vowel.  Generally, the heirarchy of vowels, from strongest to weakest, is a/e, o, i.\n\nExample: ''to'' + ''amolli'', becomes ''tamol'', meaning 'our soap'\n\nSome other categories can be inflected on the noun such as: \n: Honorific formed with the suffix ''-tzin''.\n: ''cihu\u0101-tl'' 'woman' + ''tzin'' + ''tli'' absolutive, becomes ''cihu\u0101tzintli'', 'woman (said with respect)'\n\n====Inalienable possession====\nThe suffix ''-yo'' \u2014 the same suffix as the abstract/collective ''-y\u014d(tl)'' \u2014 may be added to a possessed noun to indicate that it is a part of its possessor, rather than just being owned by it. For example, both ''nonac'' and ''nonacayo'' (possessed forms of ''nacatl'') mean \"my meat\", but ''nonac'' may refer to meat that one has to eat, while ''nonacayo'' refers to the flesh that makes up one's body. This is known as '''inalienable''', '''integral''' or '''organic possession'''.<ref>Andrews (2003): pp. 382\u2013384; Carochi (2001): pp. 308\u2013309; Lockhart (2001): pp. 69\u201370.</ref>\n{{see also|Inalienable possession}}\n\n====Derivational morphology====\n*''-tia'' derives from noun X a verb with an approximate meaning of \"to provide with X \" or \"to become X.\"\n*''-huia'' derives from noun X a verb with an approximate meaning of \"to use X \" or \"to provide with X.\"\n*''-y\u014dtl'' derives from a noun X  a noun with an abstract meaning of \"X-hood or X-ness.\"\n*''-yoh'' derives from a noun X a noun with a meaning of \"thing full of X\" or \"thing with a lot of X.\"\n\n=== Verbs ===\n\nAll verbs are marked with prefixes in order to agree with the person of the subject, and, where there is one, the object. In addition, verbs take a special suffix to mark plural subjects (only animates take plural agreement).\n\nAn example of an intransitive verb, with subject marking: ''niy\u014dli'' 'I live,' ''tiy\u014dli'' 'you (singular) live,' ''y\u014dli'' he, she, it lives,' ''tiy\u014dlih'' 'we live,' ''any\u014dlih'' 'you (plural) live,' ''y\u014dlih'' 'they live.'\n\n====Subject and object marking====\n\nThe person prefixes are identical for all tenses and moods (with the exception of the imperative, whose prefix is ''x(i)-''), but the plural number suffix varies according to tense or mood. In the table below, ''\u00d8-'' indicates there is no prefix.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Subject\n!Marking\n!Notes\n!Examples\n|-\n!1st person singular\n|''ni-'', 'I'\n|''n-'' before a vowel\n|''nicu\u012bca'' 'I sing,' ''n\u0113hua'' 'I depart' \n|-\n!2nd person singular\n|''ti-'', 'you'\n|''t-'' before a vowel\n|''ticu\u012bca'' 'you sing,' ''t\u0113hua'' 'you depart'  \n|-\n!3rd person singular\n|''\u00d8-'', 'he, she, it' \n|always zero\n|''cu\u012bca'' 'he/she/it sings,' ''\u0113hua'' 'he/she/it departs'  \n|-\n!1st person plural \n|''ti-'' (verb) + plural suffix, 'we' \n|''t-'' before a vowel\n|''ticu\u012bcah'' 'we sing,' ''t\u0113huah'' 'we depart'  \n|-\n!2nd person plural\n|''an-'' (verb) + plural suffix 'you' \n|''am-'' before a vowel, ''m'' or ''p''\n|''ancu\u012bcah'' 'you sing,' ''am\u0113huah'' 'you depart'  \n|-\n!3rd person plural \n|''\u00d8-'' (verb) + plural suffix, 'they' \n|only with animates\n|''cu\u012bcah'' 'they sing,' ''\u0113huah'' 'they depart' \n|-\n!Imperative singular\n|''xi-'', 'you'\n|''x-'' before a vowel\n|''xicu\u012bca'' 'sing!'

If the object is unknown or is simply 'things/people in general' the unspecified object prefixes may be used. Compare ''niccua'' 'I am eating it (ie. something specific)' to ''nitlacua'' 'I am eating'.\n\nPlural suffixes are never used to mark plural objects, only plural subjects. Unspecified objects are never plural.\n\nA Classical Nahuatl verb thus has the following structure:\n\nSUBJECT PREFIX + OBJECT PREFIX + VERB STEM + SUBJECT NUMBER (example: ''ti-quim-itta-h'', we - them - see - plural, i.e., 'we see them')\n\nDirect arguments of the verb - that is, subject and object - are obligatorily marked on the verb. If there are both direct and indirect objects (which are not morphologically distinguished), only one may be marked on the verb.\n\nOther inflectional categories may be optionally marked, for example direction of motion. Other inflections include the [[applicative voice|applicative]] and [[causative]], both [[valency (linguistics)|valency]] changing operations; that is, they increase the number of arguments associated with a verb, transforming an intransitive verb into transitive, or a transitive verb into bitransitive.\n\n====Tense and mood inflection====\n\nThe different tenses and moods are formed, somewhat as in Latin or Ancient Greek, by adding the person inflections to the appropriate verbal base or stem.\n\nThe '''present''' tense is formed from base 1, the normal or [[Lemma (morphology)|citation form]] of the verb (also known as the imperfective stem), with no special suffixes. The plural subject suffix is ''-h''. Examples: ''nicochi'' 'I am sleeping,' ''tlahtoah'' 'they are speaking,' ''nicch\u012bhua'' 'I am making it.'\n\nThe '''preterite''' or perfect tense is similar in meaning to the English simple past or present perfect. It is formed using base 2. The singular often ends in ''-h'' or ''-c'' while the plural suffix is ''-queh.''\n\nThe formation of base 2, also known as the perfective stem, depends on the specific verb, but is usually shorter in form than base 1, often dropping a final vowel.\n\nThe preterite is often accompanied by the prefix ''\u014d-'' (sometimes called the augment, or antecessive prefix). The function of this prefix is to mark that the action of the verb is complete at the time of speaking (or in a subordinate clause, at the time of the action described by the main verb). The augment is frequently absent in mythic or historical narratives. Examples: ''\u014dnicoch'' 'I slept,' ''\u014dtlatohqueh'' 'they spoke,' ''\u014dnicch\u012buh'' 'I made it.' The preterite also can be used to create agentive constructions\n\nThe '''pluperfect''' is also formed with the use of base 2 and the augment, but with the suffix ''-ca'' in the singular and ''-cah'' in the plural. The pluperfect roughly corresponds with the English past perfect, although more precisely it indicates that a particular action or state was in effect in the past but that it has been undone or reversed at the time of speaking. Examples: ''\u014dnicochca'' 'I had slept,' ''\u014dtlatohcah'' 'they had spoken,' ''\u014dnicch\u012buhca'' 'I had made it.'\n\nThe '''imperfect''' is similar in meaning to the imperfect in the [[Romance languages]]. It is formed with base 1, plus ''-ya'' or ''-yah'' in the plural. Sometimes the final vowel of the stem is lengthened. Examples: ''nicochiya'' 'I was sleeping,' ''tlahto\u0101yah'' 'they used to speak,' ''nicch\u012bhuaya'' 'I was making it.'\n\nThe '''habitual present''' or '''customary present''' or '''quotidian''' tense is formed from base 1. The suffix is ''-ni'', with the stem vowels sometimes lengthened before it. Rather than one specific event this tense expresses the subject's tendency or propensity to repeatedly or habitually perform the same action over time (e.g. ''miquini'' 'mortal,' lit. '(one who is) prone to die'. It is frequently translated into English with a noun or noun phrase, for example: ''cu\u012bcani'' 'one who sings, singer,' ''tlahcuilo\u0101ni'' (from ''ihcuiloa'' 'write, paint') 'scribe,' or '[[tlatoani|tlahto\u0101ni]]' (from ''ihtoa'' 'speak') the title for the ruler of a Mexica city. Plural formation of this form is variable. It can be in ''-nih'' or ''-nimeh.'' In some cases, the plural does not use ''-ni'' at all but instead a preterite ending, as with ''tlahtohqueh,'' the plural of ''tlahto\u0101ni,'' or ''tlahcuilohqueh,'' the plural of ''tlahcuilo\u0101ni.'' These preterite forms are also used to create possessive forms.\n\nThe '''future''' tense is formed from base 3, with a suffix ''-z'' in the singular and ''-zqueh'' in the plural.\n\nBase 3 is normally the same as base 1, except for verbs whose stem ending in two vowels, in which case the second vowel is dropped, and the stem vowel is often lengthened in front of a suffix. Examples of the future: ''nicochiz'' 'I will sleep,' ''tlaht\u014dzqueh'' 'they will speak,' ''nicch\u012bhuaz'' 'I will make it.'\n\nThe '''imperative''' and '''[[optative]]''' are likewise formed from base 3, but with the plural suffix ''-c\u0101n.'' The imperative uses the special imperative subject prefixes, available only in the second person; the optative uses the normal subject prefixes (effectively it is the same mood, but outside of the second person). The imperative is used for commands, the optative is used for wishes or desires, both used in conjunction with particles: ''m\u0101 nicch\u012bhua'' 'let me make it!'\n\nThe '''conditional,''' '''irrealis''' or '''counterfactual''' are all names for the same verbal mood formed from base 3. The suffix is ''-zquiya'' (sometimes spelled ''-zquia)'' in the singular and ''-zquiyah'' in the plural. The basic meaning is that a state or action that was intended or desired did not come to pass. It can be translated as 'would have,' 'almost,' etc. Examples: ''nicochizquiya'' 'I would have slept,' ''tlaht\u014dzquiyah'' 'they would have spoken,' ''nicch\u012bhuazquiya'' 'I would have made it.'\n\nThe final mood is sometimes called as '''vetitive''' (that is, issuing a prohibition), or '''negative imperative''' (equivalent to English 'don't...') but this is not the proper sense. Another way to describe it is '''admonitive''' - issuing a warning that something may come to pass, which the speaker does not desire, and by implication steps should be taken to avoid this (compare the English conjunction ''lest''). The negative of this mood simply warns that something may not happen and this non-occurrence is not desirable. The mood is formed with base 2, the same as the preterite, but with different endings. If the preterite singular ends in ''-c'' this is replaced by the glottal stop/saltillo. In the plural the ending is ''-(h)tin'' or ''-(h)tih''. The admonitive is used in conjunction with particles ''m\u0101'' or ''n\u0113n.'' Examples: ''m\u0101 nicoch'' 'be careful, lest I sleep,' ''m\u0101 tlatohtin'' 'watch out, they may speak,' ''m\u0101 nicch\u012buh'' 'don't let me make it.'\n\n====Applicative====\nThe applicative construction adds an argument to the verb. The role of the added argument can be benefactive, malefactive, indirect object or similar. It is formed by the suffix ''-lia''.\n*''niquittilia'' \"I see it for him\"\n\n====Causative====\nThe causative construction also adds an argument to the verb. This argument is an agent causing the object to undertake the action of the verb. It is formed by the suffix ''-tia''.\n*''niquittatia''  \"I make him see it/I show it to him\"\n\n====Unspecified Subject/Passive====\nThe construction, called \"passive\" by some grammarians and \"unspecified subject construction\" by others, removes the subject from the valency of the verb, substituting it with a null reference, and promoting the argument marked by object prefixes to subject. The passive or unspecified subject construction uses one of two suffixes: ''-lo'' or ''-hua''.\n*quitta \"he sees it\"+ ''-lo''= ''quittalo'' \"it is seen (by someone)\"\n*miqui \"he dies\" + hua = ''micohua'' \"there is dying/people are dying\"\n\n====Directional affixes====\nDeixis:\n*''-on-''  \"away from the speaker\"\n*''on''+ ''tlahtoa'' \"to speak\" = ''ontlahtoa'' \"he/she/it speaks towards there\"\n*''-hu\u0101l-'' \" towards the speaker\"\n*''hu\u0101l''+ ''tlahtoa'' \"to speak\" =  ''hu\u0101llahtoa'' \"he/she/it speaks towards here\"\n\nIntrovert: \nImperfective: ''-qui '' \"comes towards the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + qui =\"''quittaqui'' \"he/she/it will come here to see it\" \nPerfective: ''-co''  \"has come towards the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + ''co'' =''quittaco'' \"he/she/it has come here to see it\"\n\nExtrovert:\nImperfective: ''-t\u012buh'' \"goes away from the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + t\u012buh =\"''quittat\u012buh'' \"he/she/it will go there to see it\" \nPerfective: ''-to'' \" has gone away from the speaker in order to X\"\n''qui'' + ''itta'' \"to see\" + ''to'' =''quittato'' \"he/she/it has gone there to see it\"\n\n====Derivational====\nA number of different suffixes exist to derive nouns from verbs:\n\n*''-lli'' used to derive passivized nouns from verbs.\n''tla'' \"something\" + ''ixca'' \"roast\" + ''l'' + ''tli'' = ''tlaxcalli'' \"something roasted/ a tortilla\"<br />\n''tla'' + ''ihcuiloa'' \"write/draw\" + ''l'' - ''tli'' = ''tlahcuilolli'' \"scripture/ a drawing\"\n\n*''-liztli''  used to derive abstract nouns from verbs.\n''miqui'' \"to die\" + ''liztli'' = ''miquiliztli'' \"death\"<br />\n''tlahcuiloa'' \"to write something\" +'' liztli ''= ''tlahcuiloliztli'' \"the concept of writing or being a scribe\"\n\n*''-qui'' used to derive agentive nouns from verbs.\n''ichtequi'' \"to steal\" + ''qui'' = ''ichtecqui'' \"a thief\"<br />\n''tlahu\u0101na'' \"to become drunk\" + ''qui'' = ''tlahu\u0101nqui'' \"a drunkard\"\n\n====Verbal compounds====\nTwo verbs can be compounded with the ligature morpheme ''-ti-''.\n\n====Relational Nouns and Locatives====\nSpatial and other relations are expressed with [[relational noun]]s. Some locative suffixes also exist.\n\n====Noun Incorporation====\nNoun [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] is productive in Classical Nahuatl and different kinds of material can be incorporated.\n*Body parts\n*Instruments\n*Objects\n\n==Syntax==\nThe particle ''in'' is important in Nahuatl syntax and is used as a kind of [[definite article]] and also as a subordinating particle and a deictic particle, in addition to having other functions.\n\n===Non-configurationality===\nClassical Nahuatl can be classified as a non-configurational language, allowing many different kinds of word orders, even splitting noun phrases.\n\n===VSO basic word order===\nThe basic word order of Classical Nahuatl is verb initial and often considered to be VSO, but some scholars have argued for it being VOS. However, the language being non-configurational, all word orders are allowed and are used to express different kinds of pragmatic relations, such as thematization and focus.\n\n===Nouns as predicates===\n\nAn important feature of Classical Nahuatl is that any noun can function as a standalone [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. For example, ''calli'' is commonly translated \"house\" but could also be translated \"(it) is a house\".\n\nAs predicates, nouns can take the verbal subject prefixes (but not tense inflection). Thus, ''nit\u0113uctli'' means \"I am a lord\" with the regular first person singular subject ''ni-'' attached to the noun ''t\u0113uctli'' \"lord\". Similarly ''tinocihu\u0101uh'' means \"you are my wife\", with the possessive noun ''nocihu\u0101uh'' \"my wife\" attached to the subject prefix ''ti-'' \"you\" (singular). This construction is also seen in the name ''T\u012btl\u0101cahu\u0101n'' meaning \"we are his slaves\", a name for the god [[Tezcatlipoca]].\n\n==Number system==\n[[Image:Pohualli.jpg|frame|right|<center>20</center>]]\n[[Image:Tzontli.jpg|frame|right|<center>400</center>]]\n[[Image:Xiquipilli.jpg|frame|right|<center>8000</center>]]\nClassical Nahuatl has a [[vigesimal]] or [[base 20]] number system.<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 307.</ref> In the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Aztec writing|Nahuatl script]], the numbers 20, 400 (20<sup>2</sup>) and 8,000 (20<sup>3</sup>) were represented by a flag, a feather, and a bag, respectively.\n\nIt also makes use of [[numeral classifiers]], similar to languages such as [[Chinese classifier|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].\n\n===Basic numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| 1 || c\u0113 || Becomes ''cem-'' or ''cen-'' when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 2 || \u014dme || Becomes ''\u014dm-'' or ''\u014dn-'' when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 3 || \u0113yi/y\u0113i/\u0113i/y\u0113yi || Becomes ''(y)\u0113-'' or ''(y)\u0113x-'' when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 4 || n\u0101hui || Becomes ''n\u0101hu-/n\u0101uh-'' (i.e. {{IPA|/na\u02d0w/}}) when prefixed to another element.\n|-\n| 5 || m\u0101cu\u012blli || Derived from ''m\u0101itl'' \"hand\".<ref>Andrews (2003): pp. 309\u2013310.</ref>\n|-\n| 6 || chicuac\u0113 || ''chicua-'' \"5\" + ''c\u0113'' \"1\"\n|-\n| 7 || chic\u014dme || ''chic-'' \"5\" + ''\u014dme'' \"2\"\n|-\n| 8 || chicu\u0113yi || ''chicu-'' \"5\" + ''\u0113i'' \"3\"\n|-\n| 9 || chiucn\u0101hui || ''chiuc-'' \"5\" + ''n\u0101hui'' \"4\"\n|-\n| 10 || mahtl\u0101ctli || From ''m\u0101itl'' \"hand\" + ''tl\u0101ctli'' \"torso\".<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 310.</ref>\n|-\n| 15 || caxt\u014dlli ||\n|-\n| 20 || c\u0113mp\u014dhualli || From ''c\u0113m-'' \"1\" + ''p\u014dhualli'' \"a count\" (from ''p\u014dhua'' \"to count\").<ref name=\"a311\">Andrews (2003): p. 311.</ref>\n|-\n| 400 || c\u0113ntzontli || From ''c\u0113n-'' \"1\" + ''tzontli'' \"hair\".<ref name=\"a311\"/>\n|-\n| 8000 || c\u0113nxiquipilli || From ''c\u0113n-'' \"1\" + ''xiquipilli'' \"bag\".<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 312.</ref>\n|}\n\n===Compound numbers===\nMultiples of 20, 400 or 8,000 are formed by replacing ''c\u0113m-'' or ''c\u0113n-'' with another number. E.g. ''\u014dmp\u014dhualli'' \"40\" (2\u00d720), ''mahtl\u0101ctzontli'' \"4,000\" (10\u00d7400), ''n\u0101uhxiquipilli'' \"32,000\" (4\u00d78,000).<ref>Andrews (2003): pp. 311\u2013312.</ref>\n\nThe numbers in between those above\u201411 to 14, 16 to 19, 21 to 39, and so forth\u2014are formed by following the larger number with a smaller number which is to be added to the larger one. The smaller number is prefixed with ''om-'' or ''on-'', or in the case of larger units, preceded by ''\u012bpan'' \"on it\" or ''\u012bhu\u0101n'' \"with it\". E.g. ''mahtl\u0101ctli onc\u0113'' \"11\" (10+1), ''caxt\u014dlon\u0113yi'' \"18\" (15+3), ''c\u0113mp\u014dhualmahtl\u0101ctli om\u014dme'' \"32\" (20+10+2); ''c\u0113ntzontli caxt\u014dlp\u014dhualpan n\u0101uhp\u014dhualom\u014dme'' \"782\" (1\u00d7400+15\u00d720+4\u00d720+2).<ref>Andrews (2003): pp. 312\u2013313; Lockhart (2001): pp. 49\u201350.</ref> <!-- To do: tlamic -->\n\n===Classifiers===\nDepending on the objects being counted, Nahuatl may use a [[measure word|classifier]] or [[counter word]]. These include:\n*''-tetl'' for small, round objects (literally \"rock\")\n*''-p\u0101ntli'' for counting rows\n*''-tlamantli'' for foldable or stackable things\n*''-\u014dl\u014dtl'' for roundish or oblong-shaped things (literally \"maize cob\")\nWhich classifier a particular object takes is loose and somewhat arbitrary.<ref>Andrews (2003): p. 316</ref>\n\n===Ordinal numbers===\n[[Ordinal numbers (linguistics)|Ordinal numbers]] (first, second, third, etc.) are formed by preceding the number with ''ic'' or ''inic''.<ref>Andrews (2001): p. 452; Lockhart (2001): p. 50.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--BEGIN biblio format. -->\n* {{cite book |author=Andrews, J.

It was released in 1983 under the Tone of Life imprint, and was later reissued in 2016 by [[Light in the Attic Records]].<ref name=pop/><ref name=rec/><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> The album - recorded in [[This Heat#History|Cold Storage]] - combines [[post-punk]] and [[dub music|dub]] with a range of different stylistic influences from [[world music]]. Intended as a reaction against \u201cthe culture of death that was around\u201d at the time, the album is also far more positive in comparison to Bullen's work with This Heat; its \"[[koan]]ic\" and \"ephemeral\" lyrics subverting common linguistic cliches and tropes through repetition.\n\nMostly ignored in 1983, the album would go on to become an expensive & \"sought-after\" [[collector's item]] in the decades following its release. It received far more attention upon being reissued, with most of it being very positive in nature. The album has additionally garnered praised from musicians such as [[David Grubbs]] and [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Daniel O'Sullivan]]. \n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Lifetones_duo.jpg|thumb|right|Lifetones (c.1982/83): Charles Bullen (left) and Julius Cornelius Samuel (right) were neighbours.]]\n\nAfter This Heat disbanded in 1982, Bullen recruited Samuel (whom he'd met whilst buying a clarinet in a junk shop<ref name=ra/>) from his own neighbourhood to record the 6 songs that would appear on the album at Cold Storage (the studio where his former band [[This Heat]] had recorded most of their material).<ref name=tum/> The album was heavily influenced by the [[reggae]] and world music that was locally popular in [[Brixton]] at the time.<ref name=tum/><ref name=ra/>\n\nMany listeners would later speculate that Bullen and Samuel were the same person, an idea that was refuted in the liner notes to the album's 2016 reissue.<ref name=sc/><ref name=pop/> In fact, Samuel would later go on to record and release music of his own under the moniker \"Dub Judah\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2764818-J-Samuel-2|title=J.

It was released in 1983 under the Tone of Life imprint, and was later reissued in 2016 by [[Light in the Attic Records]].<ref name=pop/><ref name=rec/><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> The album - recorded in [[This Heat#History|Cold Storage]] - combines [[post-punk]] and [[dub]] with a range of different stylistic influences from [[world music]]. Intended as a reaction against \u201cthe culture of death that was around\u201d at the time, the album is also far more positive in comparison to Bullen's work with This Heat; its \"[[koan]]ic\" and \"ephemeral\" lyrics subverting common linguistic cliches and tropes through repetition.\n\nMostly ignored in 1983, the album would go on to become an expensive & \"sought-after\" [[collector's item]] in the decades following its release. It received far more attention upon being reissued, with most of it being very positive in nature. The album has additionally garnered praised from musicians such as [[David Grubbs]] and [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Daniel O'Sullivan]]. \n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Lifetones_duo.jpg|thumb|right|Lifetones (c.1982/83): Charles Bullen (left) and Julius Cornelius Samuel (right) were neighbours.]]\n\nAfter This Heat disbanded in 1982, Bullen recruited Samuel (whom he'd met whilst buying a clarinet in a junk shop<ref name=ra/>) from his own neighbourhood to record the 6 songs that would appear on the album at Cold Storage (the studio where his former band [[This Heat]] had recorded most of their material).<ref name=tum/> The album was heavily influenced by the [[reggae]] and world music that was locally popular in [[Brixton]] at the time.<ref name=tum/><ref name=ra/>\n\nMany listeners would later speculate that Bullen and Samuel were the same person, an idea that was refuted in the liner notes to the album's 2016 reissue.<ref name=sc/><ref name=pop/> In fact, Samuel would later go on to record and release music of his own under the moniker \"Dub Judah\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2764818-J-Samuel-2|title=J.
