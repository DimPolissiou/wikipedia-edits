That track was named Yavapai Downs, after the Native Americn Tribe and the county it was located in.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

He died before the Turkish [[Surname Law]] was adopted and the surname U\u011fural is actually the surname his family members adopted after his death.\n\n==Early years==\nMustafa Necati was born in 1894 in [[\u0130zmir]]. His father was Halit and his mother was Naciye. After his primary and secondary education in \u0130zmir, he went to [[\u0130stanbul]] for higher education and studied law. He returned to \u0130zmir in 1914 to serve as a lawyer and teacher. In 1915 he established a private school with his friend [[Vas\u0131f \u00c7\u0131nar]]. He also served as a legal adviser for the local railway company. After the [[First World War]] in which the [[Ottoman Empire]] was defeated, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fired the railway workers.

After \u0130zmir was [[occupation of \u0130zmir|occupied]] by the [[Greek army]], he fled to \u0130stanbul and then to [[Bal\u0131kesir]], where he began to participate in the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. Among other things he published a short lived newspaper to defend Turkish rights against Greek invasion.<ref name=\"Bal\u0131kesir\">[http://sbe.balikesir.edu.tr/dergi/edergi/c8s13/makale/c8s13m8.pdf University of Bal\u0131kesir periodical {{in lang|tr}}]</ref>\n\n==As a politician during the War of Independence==\nAfter the [[Ottoman parliament]] in \u0130stanbul was abolished by the Allies on 16 March 1920, [[Turkish parliament]] was established in [[Ankara]] on 23 April 1920 and Mustafa Necati was elected as the [[Manisa|Saruhan]] (present Manisa) MP. However, during the 1920-1922 term he spent most of his time out of Ankara. He was appointed as the member of [[Independence Tribunals (Turkey)|Independence Tribunals]] in [[Sivas]] and then [[Kastamonu]]. Finally he was appointed as the chairman of [[Amasya]] Independence Tribunal.<ref name=\"Bal\u0131kesir\"/>\n\n==As a politician in the Republic of Turkey==\nAs soon as the Republic was proclaimed on 29 September 1923, Mustafa Necati became a government minister of [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]]\u2019s cabinets. His first seat was [[Ministry of Construction and Settlement|Minister of Exchange Construction and Settlement]] in the [[1st government of Turkey]]. This was a very important seat for its main responsibility was the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. In the [[2nd government of Turkey]] he was the [[ministry of Justice|Minister of Justice]]. However his most important seat was that of [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Minister of National Education]] following a revision in the [[4th government of Turkey]]. He kept this post in the [[5th government of Turkey]] till his death.\n\n==Nation schools==\nUp to 1928 the [[Arabic script]] was used in Turkey. However, the [[Turkish language]] has 8 vowels and the Arabic script  remained incapable in reproducing the Turkish words. Nevertheless, being the script of [[Quran]] it was considered to be inalterable. But president [[Atat\u00fcrk]] decided to adopt [[Latin alphabet]]  (with small changes). Moreover, he insisted that the reform should be carried out immediately. In addition to adding the Latin alphabet to school curricula, short term courses for the adults called [[Nation's schools]] ({{lang-tr|Millet Mektebi}}) were established. As the minister of National Education, Mustafa Necati was responsible for establishing these courses. The courses were successful and Necati was later considered to be one of the pioneers of the new [[Turkish alphabet]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mustafa.necati.yeted.org.tr/ |title=Mustafa Necati page |language=tr |access-date=2015-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418002759/http://mustafa.necati.yeted.org.tr/ |archive-date=2015-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMustafa Necati died due to appendicitis on 1 January 1929, the very same day the Nation Schools were opened.

His first seat was [[Ministry of Construction and Settlement|Minister of Exchange Construction and Settlement]] in the [[1st government of Turkey]].

He kept this post in the [[5th government of Turkey]] till his death.\n\n==Nation schools==\nUp to 1928 the [[Arabic script]] was used in Turkey. However, the [[Turkish language]] has 8 vowels and the Arabic script  remained incapable in reproducing the Turkish words. Nevertheless, being the script of [[Quran]] it was considered to be inalterable. But president [[Atat\u00fcrk]] decided to adopt [[Latin alphabet]]  (with small changes). Moreover, he insisted that the reform should be carried out immediately. In addition to adding the Latin alphabet to school curricula, short term courses for the adults called [[Nation's schools]] ({{lang-tr|Millet Mektebi}}) were established. As the minister of National Education, Mustafa Necati was responsible for establishing these courses. The courses were successful and Necati was later considered to be one of the pioneers of the new [[Turkish alphabet]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mustafa.necati.yeted.org.tr/ |title=Mustafa Necati page |language=tr |access-date=2015-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418002759/http://mustafa.necati.yeted.org.tr/ |archive-date=2015-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMustafa Necati died due to appendicitis on 1 January 1929, the very same day the Nation Schools were opened.
