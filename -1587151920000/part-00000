The Corona was Toyota's second sedan in their hierarchy of products, just below the Crown, until 1968 when the Corona name was used on a larger, all new platform called the [[Toyota Mark II|Toyota Corona Mark II]], which gave buyers more interior space while still offering dependable, affordable performance.\n\nThe Corona became successful in export markets and was marketed under a number of different nameplates worldwide\u2014including those branded in much of Asia as Coronas marketed in European markets as [[Toyota Carina|Carinas]].\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T10}} First generation (T10; 1957\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (T10)\n| image = 1957 Toyopet Corona 01.jpg\n| aka = Toyopet Corona\n| production = 1957\u20131960\n| assembly = Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Honsha plant|Honsha plant]])\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list\n  | 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n  | 3-door van\n  }}\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related = {{unbulleted list\n  | [[Toyota Crown]]\n  | [[Toyopet Master]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | 1.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota Type S engine|S]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota P engine|P]]'' I4\n  }}\n| transmission = 3-speed manual transmission\n| wheelbase = {{convert|94.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|154|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width =  {{convert|57.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|59.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|960|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe first-generation Corona, introduced in May 1957, was designed with parts from the previous-generation Crown and [[Toyopet Master|Master]] following a major restyle and enlargement of the Crown. The design of many of the body panels were cut down from the Master which had ceased production. Aside from the four-door sedan, the ST16/PT16 van versions were also available. Originally, the ST10/16 Corona was fitted with the old sidevalve \"S\" engine, with {{convert|33|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Ruiz>{{cite book |last=Ruiz |first=Marco |title='The Complete History of the Japanese Car: 1907 to the Present |publisher=ERVIN srl |location=Rome |year=1986 |page=174 |isbn=0-517-61777-3}}</ref> In April 1958 the Corona underwent a light facelift, with a new hood ornament and door handles. The tail light design of this generation is reminiscent of the [[1949 Ford]] sedan.\n\nThe {{convert|997|cc|abbr=on}} [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Toyota P engine|P series]] engine replaced the old S in September 1959, and offered substantially more power with {{convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm. The P-engined Corona sedan was capable of traveling at {{convert|105|km/h| mph|0|abbr=on}}. The car also underwent another facelift, including a mesh grille and a new rear seat which allowed seating for five rather than the previous four. As regulations regarding taxis at the time required engines no larger than {{convert|910|cc|abbr=on}}, dealers restricted the power for taxi vehicles. Due to the upgrade in dimensions of the Crown, Toyota needed to continue manufacturing a vehicle with similar size dimensions to the first Crown, primarily to be used for taxi usage. This vehicle saw the introduction of a [[unibody|monocoque]] chassis structure, and an independent front suspension using double wishbones. Due to the monocoque chassis, Toyota was able to produce a vehicle under {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:1957 Toyopet Corona ST10 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1957 Corona (ST10)]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T20|T30}} Second generation (T20, T30; 1960\u20131964) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (T20/T30)\n| image = 1960 Toyopet Corona 01.jpg\n| aka = {{unbulleted list\n  | Toyopet Corona\n  | Toyopet Coronaline <ref>[http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/vehicle_lineage/car/id60007304/index.html Toyopet Coronaline, www.toyota-global.com] Retrieved 14 June 2017</ref>\n  | Toyota 1900\n  | Toyota Tiara<ref name=Tiara>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/text/entering_the_automotive_business/chapter1/section5/item3.html |title=The Advance of Knockdown Exports |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2014-09-22}}</ref>\n  }}\n| production = {{unbulleted list\n  | March 1960 \u2013 September 1964<ref name=\"CG60\">{{cite book |ref=CG60 |title=Car Graphic: Car Archives Vol. 1, '60s Japanese/American Cars |publisher=Nigensha |year=2000 |language=Japanese |page=8 |location=Tokyo |isbn=4-544-09171-3}}</ref>\n  | April 1963 \u2013 unknown (Australia)<ref name=\"Toyota Motor Corporation\">{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/overseas/overview/oceania.html |title=Overview of Overseas Production Affiliates: Oceania |publisher=Toyota Motor Corporation |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n  }}\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list\n  | Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Motomachi plant|Motomachi plant]])\n  | Australia: [[Port Melbourne]] ([[Australian Motor Industries|AMI]])<ref>[http://www.toyota.com.au/toyota/company/history Toyota Australia:History].

It was introduced at a critical time for the company in North America. Their first flagship car, the [[Toyota Crown|Toyopet Crown]], was unsuccessful in the US market, and the Corona was added to offer a choice along with the [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Land Cruiser]]. At the time, there was little market for an off-road vehicle like the Land Cruiser. The front mask of the T20 Corona is reminiscent of the 1955\u20131957 [[Ford Thunderbird]], and shares its appearance with the entry-level offering, called the [[Toyota Publica]].\n\nThe Tiara was introduced to sell alongside the [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], as a smaller companion. Introduced in March 1960, the car was powered by a {{convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.0&nbsp;L [[Toyota P engine|\"P\"]] series motor. With a three-speed manual transmission, top speed was a mere {{convert|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CG60\"/> In March 1961, Toyota introduced a more powerful 1.5-litre \"R\" series motor, the same motor from the Crown, and an even larger 1.9-litre engine was added in 1964. Fortunately for Toyota, the problems with the Crown were not seen on the Tiara as the lighter body ({{convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|-1|disp=or}} less than the Crown) made the R series engine more sufficient.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Tiara station wagon was seemingly aimed at women, {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} with many of the original brochures featuring only women in a dinner dress as well as playing golf. Nevertheless, it sold better than the Crown and had a lot fewer mechanical problems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Tiara ended up being the only sedan sold by Toyota in the USA until the reworked second-generation Crown appeared. By that time, the Tiara had been redesigned and given the Corona label from the [[Japanese domestic market]]. A total of only 318 of these vehicles were sold in the US.\n\nIn Australia the Tiara was produced in [[Port Melbourne]], Victoria by [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) starting from 1963.\n\nTwo concept cars were shown at the 1963 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] \u2013 the [[Toyota Corona 1500S Convertible|Corona 1500S Convertible]] and the [[Toyota Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan|Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan]]. The [[Toyota Corona Sports Coupe|Corona Sports Coupe]] was a [[concept car]] shown at the 1963 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] \u2013 it shared little with the Corona except the suspension and the name. Load carrying abilities of the newly introduced '''Coronaline''' (which was technically a [[coup\u00e9 utility]]) were shared with the heavier capacity [[Toyota Stout]].\n\n{{gallery\n|File:1962 Toyopet CoronaLine 01.jpg|1962 Coronaline PT26\n|File:CoronaRT20.jpg|1964 RT20D Corona 1500 Deluxe\n|File:Toyopet-CoronaT20.JPG|1964 RT20D rear view\n|}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T40|T50}} Third generation (T40, T50; 1964\u20131970) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation (T40/T50)\n| image = 1966-1967 Toyopet Corona.jpg\n| aka = Toyopet Corona\n| production = {{unbulleted list\n  | Sep 1964 \u2013 Jan 1970 (Japan)<ref name=\"VIM\" />\n  | 1966\u20131972 (South Korea)\n  }}\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list\n  | Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Motomachi plant|Motomachi plant]])\n  | Japan: [[Kariya, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Auto Body]])<ref name=SHIOJI>{{cite journal |ref=harv |year=1995 |last=Shioji |first=Hiromi |title='Itaku' Automotive Production: An Aspect of the Development of Full-Line and Wide-Selection Production by Toyota in the 1960s |volume=65 |issue=1 |journal=Kyoto University Economic Review |publisher=Kyoto University |page=28 |jstor=43217480 |issn=0023-6055}}</ref>\n  | Australia: [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]] ([[Australian Motor Industries|AMI]])\n  | South Korea: [[Shinjin Motor]] (1966-1972)<ref name=\"GM-Daewoo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.carlife.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=school&wr_id=1585 |title=GM-Daewoo Auto \u2013 40 turbulent years |accessdate=2010-03-08 |date=November 2001 |language=Korean}}</ref>|Christchurch, New Zealand<ref name=\"SteelBroHistory\"/>\n  }}\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list\n  | 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n  | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coupe]]\n  | 3-door van\n  | 5-door [[station wagon]]/van\n  | 5-door [[hatchback]]\n  | 2-door [[coupe utility]]\n  }}\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | 1.2&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota P engine#2P|2P]]'' [[Straight-four engine|I4]] (PT40/46)\n  | 1.3&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota P engine#3P|3P]]'' I4 (PT41/47)\n  | 1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota R engine#2R|2R]]'' I4 (RT40/46/50/56)\n  | 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota R engine#4R|4R]]'' I4 (RT40/51)\n  | 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota R engine#9R|9R]]'' I4 (RT55)\n  | 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota R engine#7R|7R, 7R-B]]'' I4 (RT41/53/54)\n| 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota R engine#12R|12R]]'' I4 (Australia)\n  | 1.9&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota R engine#3R|3R]]'' I4 RT43/52)\n  }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list\n  | 2-speed ''Toyoglide'' automatic\n  | 3-speed manual\n  | 4-speed manual all-synchromesh<ref name=Autocar1968>{{cite magazine |title=Used Car Test: 1966 Toyota Corona Estate |magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |series=129 |number=3,795 |date=7 November 1968 |pages=29\u201331}}</ref>\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2420|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4110|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1550|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|1420|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (sedan)\n  | {{convert|54.1|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} (coupe)\n  }}\n| weight = {{unbulleted list\n  | {{convert|2140|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (sedan)\n  | {{convert|2205|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (coupe)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe third generation was introduced September 1964,<ref name=\"VIM\">{{Cite book |title=Toyota Vehicle Identification Manual |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~stepho/coronprd.htm |year=1984 |publisher=Toyota Motor Corporation \u2013 Overseas Parts Department |location=Japan |id=Catalog No.97913-84}}</ref> one month before the [[1964 Summer Olympics]].

Body styles were further reduced to a two-door hardtop coup\u00e9, a four-door sedan and station wagon. The engine continued to use an [[OHV]] on base level vehicles, and [[SOHC]] on better equipped versions and most of the two-door coup\u00e9s. The engines used in the Mark II were often shared with the Corona.\n\nTrim levels originally offered were the 1500 standard or DX, 1600 DX, and the 1600 SL (although the 1900&nbsp;cc 8R engine was offered in North America and South Africa).

Another, milder yet restyle appeared in August 1972, including new grilles and hubcaps. The Hardtop gained a two-litre engine at this time. Among the mechanical updates were electronic fuel injection installed on the 18R-E with a [[SOHC]] engine design that appeared in the two-door coup\u00e9. The 18R-B had twin SU Carburetors, with an electronically controlled automatic transmission, labeled ECT. [[Inline-four engine|Four-cylinder engine]] choices were pushrod 1.35 (van Standard only), 1.5, and 1.6-litre engines, and overhead-cam 1.7, 1.9, and 2.0-litre gasoline units. Vans (wagons) were sold with 1.35 3P or 1.5-litre 2R engines for the first year, but the 1.5 was replaced by the 1.6-litre 12R engine in January 1971.<ref name=Oldies>{{cite web |title=Toyota Corona T8/T9 |url=http://www.toyotaoldies.de/galt8.html |first=Alexander |last=Hajek |work=Toyota Oldies}}</ref> The 1.7-litre 6R engine was added to the lineup in September 1970, and became available in the van in September 1971.<ref name=Partscat>{{citation |title=Toyopet Corona RT80, 90 |type=parts catalog |language=Japanese |ref=RT80 |pages=2\u20134 |location=Japan |id=52229-78 |date=June 1978 |publisher=Toyota}}</ref> North America only received the Corona wagon in July 1972 (and only for the 1973 model year), as the two-litre RT89.\n\nA performance oriented in-house competitor called the [[Toyota Carina]], close in size to the Corona and based on the [[Toyota Celica]] platform, was introduced in 1970. It was available at a different dealership sales channel called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]''. This generation of Corona was available at dealerships called ''Toyopet Store''. The Corona pick-up was no longer manufactured due to the introduction of the [[Toyota Hilux#N10|Hilux]] in 1969. Along with the August 1972 facelift, the Corona received the 2.0-litre engine which appeared in the 2000SL and the 2000SR with fuel injection. The 7R-engined RT82 was short-lived in Japan, only being available between February and September 1970, but in other markets it may have remained available until the introduction of the next Corona.\n\nIn the United States, the 1970s were probably the Corona's high point, helped by the fuel crises of 1973 and 1979. Competition for sales continued from the [[Nissan Bluebird]], and from a new competitor from the [[Mazda RX-2]] in 1971, with an introduction to the US in 1972.\n\nThese models were assembled in New Zealand (by Steel's) and Australia (Australian Motor Industries or AMI). NZ models initially had a 1.5-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual and then the 6R 1.7-litre OHC engine. After the first facelift (new nose and tail, square instead of round instrument housings) for 1972, the 6R engine was again used. The 1972 facelift (another new grille) saw two models \u2013 1.6-litre OHV with three-speed column-shift manual and bench front seat and 1.7-litre four-speed floor shift manual and high-back buckets. This version was badged 1700SE.\n\nAustralian RT81s used the 1.6-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual. Local content was much higher than the NZ cars with local instruments and heater which meant, surprisingly for the climate, there were no centre air vents. The facelift AMI assembled model with the revised grille was released in November 1972, lasting to March 1974.\n\nA modified Corona was shown at the 1970 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] as the [[Toyota Electronics Car|Electronics Car]]. Based on the Corona Hardtop 1700SL, it showed many electronic innovations but was not put into production.\n\n{{gallery\n|lines=4\n|File:Toyota Corona 1600 Sedan (RT81).jpg|Toyota Corona 1600 Sedan (RT82), as assembled by [[Australian Motor Industries|AMI]] in Australia, 1972 to 1974\n|File:Toyopet Corona Van T80.jpg|Toyopet Corona Van (T80), pre-facelift 1970\u201371 model\n|File:1972 Toyota Corona Coupe (33536436546).jpg|1972 Toyota Corona Coupe\n|File:1973 Toyota Corona (RT81) SE sedan (2015-08-09) 05.jpg|Toyota Corona (RT81) SE sedan (Australia)\n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T100|T110|T120}} Fifth generation (T100, T110, T120; 1973\u20131979) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fifth generation (T100/T110/T120)\n| image = 1975 Toyota Corona (RT104) SE sedan (2015-06-18) 01.jpg\n| caption = 1975 Toyota Corona SE sedan\n| aka = Toyota 2000 (UK market)<ref>Graham Robson, A-Z of Cars of the 1970s, 1990, p. 155</ref>\n| production = Aug 1973<ref name=\"VIM\" />\u2014May 1979<ref name=\"VIM\" />\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list\n  | Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Tsutsumi plant|Tsutsumi plant]])\n  | Australia: [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]] ([[Australian Motor Industries|AMI]])\n  | Indonesia: [[Tanjung Priok]], [[North Jakarta]] (PT.

Chassis codes 100\u2013105 were reserved for sedans, with 106\u2013109 for vans, the 110\u2013115 was for the hardtop coup\u00e9 while 116\u2013119 was for the wagon versions. The 120-series model codes were used for late series face lifted models in the Japanese market fitted with the new emissions control [[Toyota TTC|TTC-C]] motors. The two-speed automatic was no longer offered. The face lift revised the hood and grille, and enlarged the tail lights. The station wagon featured optional wood panel body claddings. Engines were 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre [[SOHC]] units. In North America, the 20R 2.2-litre engine was used.\n\nThe high-performance '''2000GT''' Sedan and Hardtop Coup\u00e9 with 18R-G twin cam engine were only offered in Japan. Yamaha supplied the alloy head for these high performance normally aspirated engines fitted with twin Mikuni-Solex 40 mm side-draft carburettors and a compression ratio of 9.7:1. Gearbox was the Porsche-type syncromesh 5-speed P51 coupled to a 4.1 F series limited slip differential, giving a claimed top speed of {{cvt|200|km/h|mph|round=5}}.\n\n[[File:1973 Toyota Corona 01.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Corona sedan (RT102, Japan)]]\n\nNorth American models had longer bumpers (hiding recoverable bumper shocks) to meet local {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} impact standards; they gained standard radial tires in 1975. Side door impact upgrades were installed in all doors. This series also saw the standard (on some models) Electro Sensor Panel which monitored fluid and bulb status. As with earlier Coronas, some models had a shifter mounted on the steering column. Sales of the Corona continued to grow as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The two-door hardtop continued, with trim levels 1600GL, 1800SR and the 2000SR, with the coup\u00e9 proving popular in the USA but more popular yet in Japan. The two-door sedan, meanwhile, sold well in the United States but very little in Japan, and this was the last Corona to be offered in this bodystyle.\n\nThe Corona saw new competitors in both Japan, Europe and the United States from the [[Honda Accord]] in 1976, and the [[Subaru Leone|Subaru DL]] in 1974. The advantage the Honda and Subaru had over the Corona was that both vehicles were [[front-wheel-drive]], while the Corona was [[rear-wheel-drive]]. In response to the Japanese Governments passage of emission control regulations, Toyota introduced the [[Toyota TTC]]-V (Vortex) on the {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 19R engine only, using an [[Exhaust gas recirculation]] implementation. In Japan, the 12R-U engine was designed to run on LPG for taxi usage, starting in October 1975. To meet new emissions regulations the 1.6-litre 12R engine was replaced by the more modern 2T-J in commercial models. The 18R-E engine with fuel injection that was used in the 2000SL and 2000SR discontinued production due to emission issues. In November 1975, the 1800 saw the removal of the twin carburetors due to emission regulations, which meant the discontinuation of the 1800SR coup\u00e9. June 1976 saw the installation of a catalyst system included with the TTC-C system.\n\nJanuary 1977 saw a minor appearance change to both the interior and exterior, with a revised grille and hood, as well as new headlight surrounds. The taillights were also modified; while still rectangular, they were less busy in appearance.<ref name=CarZA1178>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Wright |editor-first=Cedric |date=September 1978 |title=Toyota Corona SL 2000 sports sedan |magazine=CAR |volume=22 |number=8 |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Ramsay, Son & Parker (Pty) ltd. |page=54}}</ref>\n\nNew Zealand assembly began with 1.6 OHV, three-speed manual column shift and bench front seat and 1.8-litre 16R OHC four-speed manual bucket front seat options.

Other models were fitted with rear [[drum brakes]].\n\nThe Corona range received a thorough facelift in August 1980, with new rearwards sloping rectangular headlights which gave it a more modern appearance at the front.\n\nThe T130 series was manufactured with a wide range of engine and transmission combinations. 1.6-litre [[Toyota R engine#12R|12R]], [[Toyota T engine#2T|2T]] (and associated [[Toyota T engine#12T|12T]]) and 2.0-litre [[Toyota R engine#18R|18R]] engines are the most common. The LPG-powered 12R engine became available in the Japanese domestic market in February 1979 and, along with the LPG-powered 5R engined model, continued to be built until August 1982.<ref name=JdmPartsCat130 /> The rest of the Corona range was taken out of production for the Japanese market in December 1981. Amongst other minor changes, the 1.8-litre [[Toyota T engine#3T|3T]] / [[Toyota T engine#13T|13T]] engine was added in 1981 to replace the 1.6-litre 2T / 12T. The North American Corona shared the 2.2-litre [[Toyota R engine|20R]] engine with the Celica. Emission regulations passed in 1978 were applied across the range of models offered. The 1.8L engine was equipped with electronic fuel injection as well as the 2.0L engine. In Japan the venerable 2.0L [[Toyota R engine#18R-G|18R-G]] was offered in the range-topping 2000GT, developing 101&nbsp;kW (135&nbsp;hp) at 5800 rpm.\n\nThe station wagon was, as usual at the time, marketed as a \"light van\" in Japan. This was registered as a commercial vehicle for certain tax benefits and less restrictive emissions standards. When introduced, the Corona Van was available as a 1600 (TT137V) or an 1800 (RT137V), both using engines not installed in the rest of the range. The ''2T-J'' in the 1600 Standard produces {{convert|93|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000&nbsp;rpm while the DX and GL models' 1.8-liter 16R offered {{convert|95|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm but with considerably more torque.<ref name=toyGB/> The 2T and 16R were both replaced by the newer ''12T-J'' engine in December 1979, reflecting newly tightened emissions standards for commercial vehicles in Japan.<ref name=JdmPartsCat130 /> This model, the TT138V, produces {{convert|86|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=Catvol27>{{citation | ref = JAMA27 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1980/1981 | language = Japanese | volume = 27 | date = 1980-10-20 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 194 | id = 053-800027-3400 }}</ref>\n\n===Markets===\n;United States\nThe T130 was the last Corona to be marketed in the USA. It was offered as a sedan, wagon, or liftback with either Base or LE (Luxury Edition) equipment. In North America, the Corona was replaced for the 1983 model year by the similarly sized but [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] sedan and five-door hatchback. Since then, the Camry has grown a size larger than the Corona and its sportier [[Toyota Carina|Carina]] sister car. The Corona was originally fitted with the 2.2-litre [[Toyota R engine#20R|20R]] engine, but along with a facelift for 1981 this was switched to the 2367&nbsp;cc [[Toyota R engine#22R|22R]] with {{convert|96|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4800&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=RT121>{{cite magazine | magazine =Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 |issue=January\u2013February 1981 |title=1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 121 | publisher = CBS Publications }}</ref> The facelift version received a rearward-sloping front end and a modestly restyled rear; North American cars received quad rectangular headlamps and a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed automatic.\n\n;Australia\nTo meet an 85 percent overall local parts content as a manufacturer, [[Toyota Australia]] chose to manufacture Corona sedans and wagons using 1.9-litre [[Holden Starfire engine#Starfire|Holden ''Starfire'' engines]].<ref name=Whatcar>{{Citation | title=What car is that? : in Australia & New Zealand | editor-last=Boyce | editor-first=David | ref = DB1 | year=1981 | publisher=Rigby | location=Adelaide, Australia | page = 169 | isbn=0727014803 }}</ref> As installed by Toyota, the engine received some minor changes in the form of its own camshaft, manifold, and carburettor.<ref name=Whatcar/> In Toyota engine terminology it received ''1X'' badging and was coupled with a four-speed or optional five-speed [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] 505.

Both models were available in either sedan or wagon body styles. The lower S and CS trim levels (2.0-litre) were fitted standard with a four-speed manual transmission (optional five-speed manual and three- or four-speed automatic).

In 1985, a limited edition SR model was offered in white and manual transmission only with front and rear spoilers, white painted grille and side mirrors, white highlights in the tail lamps (instead of black), SR lettering on the boot lid, red exterior pinstriping, sports front seats with red pin stripes, and a three-spoke leather steering wheel.\n\nToyota Australia introduced a facelift in November 1985. This included the addition the former CS-X grille insert for the S model and the Avante grille for the CS and CSi. There were also new wheels trims on all versions and revised tail lamp lenses. The pre-facelift models can be identified by tail lamps with dual black horizontal lines engraved along the base. The facelift models received lenses with a single, more subtle, horizontal line intersecting across the centre of the tail lights and a chrome strip at the base.

The previous generation ST160 Corona Coup\u00e9 did not update with this generation, and was not replaced until 1993, when it was renamed as the [[Toyota Curren]]. For this generation, the new Corona EXiV four-door hardtop would have to do for those looking for something extra. This was the last generation to offer the Corona GT to Japanese buyers, equipped with Toyota's [[active suspension]] technology called [[Toyota TEMS|TEMS]] included with their \"PEGASUS\"-branded four-wheel independent suspension and \"LASRE\"-branded multi-port fuel injection technology on the 3S-GELU engine.\n\nThe five-door Corona liftback was sold as the \"Corona SF\" in Japan, in a much smaller lineup than the four-door sedan. The five-door model proved much more popular in Europe, where, confusingly, it was marketed as the '''[[Toyota Carina II|Carina II]]'''. The sedan and a wagon were also part of the Carina II lineup, which was a rebadged Corona rather than the T170 Carina sold in Japan.

In Europe, the Corona was known as the '''Toyota Carina E''' and it replaced the Carina II (T170). The Carina E was built at Toyota's new factory at [[Burnaston]], near [[Derby]], England, United Kingdom, but the early cars and all GT-i models were built in Tsutsumi, Japan. The cars were imported in Europe from the third quarter of 1992 until the opening of the Burnaston factory in December that year.\n\nFor the Japanese domestic market, the Corona's platform twin the Carina received different bodywork.\n\nThis generation of Corona received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s. The exterior dimensions and engine sizes remained in compliance with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese size regulations]] so as to continue to offer a product for Japanese buyers wanting to reduce their annual tax liability.\n\nThe five-door model was called the '''Corona SF''' in Japan, while the station wagon had become a separate line there, from 1993, called the [[Toyota Caldina]].\n\nThe T190 is the last Corona for most export markets. It was marketed as '''Corona \"Absolute\"''' in Indonesia, or '''Corona Exsior''' in the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nIn mainland Europe, the Carina E was offered in XL and GL trim levels, but in the UK they were marketed as Xi (1.6-litre), XLi (1.6, 1.8-litre), SLi (1.8-litre), GLi (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), GTi (2.0-litre, no estate) and Executive (2.0-litre, no estate) between 1992 and 1996. Diesels were available as the 2.0-litre XLD and GLD trims. From 1996, the S (1.6-litre, hatchback only), GS (1.6, 1.8-litre), CD (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), and CDX (1.8, 2.0-litre) trims replaced the previous trim level scheme. Diesels were now the 2.0-litre GS and GL trims. The high performance GT-i with 3S-GE engine was offered in small numbers in certain European countries. All versions (apart from GTi/Executive) were available as a four-door saloon, five-door hatchback or five-door [[station wagon|estate car]]. Badged as a Carina, this was the 1993 [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]].\n\nIt was also sold in New Zealand, but not in Australia. Engines were the same as the Toyota Carina E, except there was no diesel variant. The [[station wagon]] variant was a [[Rebadging|badge-engineered]] [[Toyota Caldina]]. The sedans and liftbacks were assembled in [[Thames, New Zealand]], while the wagon was imported fully built up from Japan. The locally assembled cars also received special spring and damper combinations (again developed by racer [[Chris Amon]]) as well as some other changes.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Donn |date=March 1993 |title=Newsline: New Corona Station Wagon |magazine=New Zealand Car |volume=7 |number=5 |location=Auckland |publisher=Accent Publishing |page=13 |issn=0113-0196}}</ref>\n\nIn the Philippines, the Corona was only available with the 2.0-litre ''3S-FE'' engine throughout its production from 1993 to 1998. Early examples of the Corona T190 (ST191) looks similar to the 1992 Japanese spec model. It only has the 2.0 EX Saloon variant, with a choice of a 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or a 4-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The 1995 model has the facelifted exterior, having the front and rear bumpers with the black trim, and the standard three-piece rear spoiler. The Exsior was introduced in 1996, this time with extended bumpers and red/amber tail lights and garnish. Another variant of the Corona Exsior was the LE, which had genuine leather seats, faux dash wood panel, and electronic air purifier/ionizer as standard equipment. It was eventually replaced in 1998 with the Toyota Camry XV20.\n\nProduction in Japan ended in 1995, but in Europe and Southeast Asia it lasted until the end of 1997, when it was replaced by the [[Toyota Avensis|Avensis]], which was also built at Burnaston.\n\n=== {{anchor|T200}} Corona EXiV (T200) ===\nThe T200 series Corona was sold as the continuation of the [[Toyota Corona EXiV]] hardtop sedan, while the Corona Coup\u00e9's successor was relocated to ''Toyota Vista Store'' locations and reintroduced as the [[Toyota Curren]].\n\n[[File:Toyota Corona Exiv 1993.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Corona EXiV]]\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n=== Caldina (1992\u20131997) ===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Toyota Caldina van.jpg\n| image2 = Toyota Caldina Van 002.JPG\n| caption2 = Caldina van\n}}\n[[File:1992 Toyota Caldina 01.jpg|thumb|Caldina (T190)]]\n\nThe first [[Toyota Caldina]] was the five-door wagon or commercial van version of the four-door sedan Toyota Corona in Japan.

The Corona was Toyota's second sedan in their hierarchy of products, just below the Crown, until 1968 when the Corona name was used on a larger, all new platform called the [[Toyota Mark II|Toyota Corona Mark II]], which gave buyers more interior space while still offering dependable, affordable performance.\n\nThe Corona became successful in export markets and was marketed under a number of different nameplates worldwide\u2014including those branded in much of Asia as Coronas marketed in European markets as [[Toyota Carina|Carinas]].\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T10}} First generation (T10; 1957\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (T10)\n| image = 1957 Toyopet Corona 01.jpg\n| aka = Toyopet Corona\n| production = 1957\u20131960\n| assembly = Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Honsha plant|Honsha plant]])\n| body_style = {{unbulleted list\n  | 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n  | 3-door van\n  }}\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| related = {{unbulleted list\n  | [[Toyota Crown]]\n  | [[Toyopet Master]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  | 1.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota Type S engine|S]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota P engine|P]]'' I4\n  }}\n| transmission = 3-speed manual transmission\n| wheelbase = {{convert|94.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|154|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width =  {{convert|57.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height = {{convert|59.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight = {{convert|960|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe first-generation Corona, introduced in May 1957, was designed with parts from the previous-generation Crown and [[Toyopet Master|Master]] following a major restyle and enlargement of the Crown.

The car also underwent another facelift, including a mesh grille and a new rear seat which allowed seating for five rather than the previous four. As regulations regarding taxis at the time required engines no larger than {{convert|910|cc|abbr=on}}, dealers restricted the power for taxi vehicles. Due to the upgrade in dimensions of the Crown, Toyota needed to continue manufacturing a vehicle with similar size dimensions to the first Crown, primarily to be used for taxi usage. This vehicle saw the introduction of a [[unibody|monocoque]] chassis structure, and an independent front suspension using double wishbones.

It was introduced at a critical time for the company in North America. Their first flagship car, the [[Toyota Crown|Toyopet Crown]], was unsuccessful in the US market, and the Corona was added to offer a choice along with the [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Land Cruiser]]. At the time, there was little market for an off-road vehicle like the Land Cruiser. The front mask of the T20 Corona is reminiscent of the 1955\u20131957 [[Ford Thunderbird]], and shares its appearance with the entry-level offering, called the [[Toyota Publica]].\n\nThe Tiara was introduced to sell alongside the [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], as a smaller companion. Introduced in March 1960, the car was powered by a {{convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.0&nbsp;L [[Toyota P engine|\"P\"]] series motor. With a three-speed manual transmission, top speed was a mere {{convert|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CG60\"/> In March 1961, Toyota introduced a more powerful 1.5-litre \"R\" series motor, the same motor from the Crown, and an even larger 1.9-litre engine was added in 1964. Fortunately for Toyota, the problems with the Crown were not seen on the Tiara as the lighter body ({{convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|-1|disp=or}} less than the Crown) made the R series engine more sufficient.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Tiara station wagon was seemingly aimed at women, {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} with many of the original brochures featuring only women in a dinner dress as well as playing golf. Nevertheless, it sold better than the Crown and had a lot fewer mechanical problems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Tiara ended up being the only sedan sold by Toyota in the USA until the reworked second-generation Crown appeared. By that time, the Tiara had been redesigned and given the Corona label from the [[Japanese domestic market]]. A total of only 318 of these vehicles were sold in the US.\n\nIn Australia the Tiara was produced in [[Port Melbourne]], Victoria by [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) starting from 1963.\n\nTwo concept cars were shown at the 1963 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] \u2013 the [[Toyota Corona 1500S Convertible|Corona 1500S Convertible]] and the [[Toyota Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan|Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan]]. The [[Toyota Corona Sports Coupe|Corona Sports Coupe]] was a [[concept car]] shown at the 1963 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] \u2013 it shared little with the Corona except the suspension and the name.

Body styles were further reduced to a two-door hardtop coup\u00e9, a four-door sedan and station wagon. The engine continued to use an [[OHV]] on base level vehicles, and [[SOHC]] on better equipped versions and most of the two-door coup\u00e9s. The engines used in the Mark II were often shared with the Corona.\n\nTrim levels originally offered were the 1500 standard or DX, 1600 DX, and the 1600 SL (although the 1900&nbsp;cc 8R engine was offered in North America and South Africa).

Another, milder yet restyle appeared in August 1972, including new grilles and hubcaps. The Hardtop gained a two-litre engine at this time. Among the mechanical updates were electronic fuel injection installed on the 18R-E with a [[SOHC]] engine design that appeared in the two-door coup\u00e9. The 18R-B had twin SU Carburetors, with an electronically controlled automatic transmission, labeled ECT. [[Inline-four engine|Four-cylinder engine]] choices were pushrod 1.35 (van Standard only), 1.5, and 1.6-litre engines, and overhead-cam 1.7, 1.9, and 2.0-litre gasoline units. Vans (wagons) were sold with 1.35 3P or 1.5-litre 2R engines for the first year, but the 1.5 was replaced by the 1.6-litre 12R engine in January 1971.<ref name=Oldies>{{cite web |title=Toyota Corona T8/T9 |url=http://www.toyotaoldies.de/galt8.html |first=Alexander |last=Hajek |work=Toyota Oldies}}</ref> The 1.7-litre 6R engine was added to the lineup in September 1970, and became available in the van in September 1971.<ref name=Partscat>{{citation |title=Toyopet Corona RT80, 90 |type=parts catalog |language=Japanese |ref=RT80 |pages=2\u20134 |location=Japan |id=52229-78 |date=June 1978 |publisher=Toyota}}</ref> North America only received the Corona wagon in July 1972 (and only for the 1973 model year), as the two-litre RT89.\n\nA performance oriented in-house competitor called the [[Toyota Carina]], close in size to the Corona and based on the [[Toyota Celica]] platform, was introduced in 1970. It was available at a different dealership sales channel called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]''. This generation of Corona was available at dealerships called ''Toyopet Store''. The Corona pick-up was no longer manufactured due to the introduction of the [[Toyota Hilux#N10|Hilux]] in 1969. Along with the August 1972 facelift, the Corona received the 2.0-litre engine which appeared in the 2000SL and the 2000SR with fuel injection. The 7R-engined RT82 was short-lived in Japan, only being available between February and September 1970, but in other markets it may have remained available until the introduction of the next Corona.\n\nIn the United States, the 1970s were probably the Corona's high point, helped by the fuel crises of 1973 and 1979. Competition for sales continued from the [[Nissan Bluebird]], and from a new competitor from the [[Mazda RX-2]] in 1971, with an introduction to the US in 1972.\n\nThese models were assembled in New Zealand (by Steel's) and Australia (Australian Motor Industries or AMI). NZ models initially had a 1.5-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual and then the 6R 1.7-litre OHC engine. After the first facelift (new nose and tail, square instead of round instrument housings) for 1972, the 6R engine was again used. The 1972 facelift (another new grille) saw two models \u2013 1.6-litre OHV with three-speed column-shift manual and bench front seat and 1.7-litre four-speed floor shift manual and high-back buckets. This version was badged 1700SE.\n\nAustralian RT81s used the 1.6-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual. Local content was much higher than the NZ cars with local instruments and heater which meant, surprisingly for the climate, there were no centre air vents. The facelift AMI assembled model with the revised grille was released in November 1972, lasting to March 1974.\n\nA modified Corona was shown at the 1970 [[Tokyo Motor Show]] as the [[Toyota Electronics Car|Electronics Car]]. Based on the Corona Hardtop 1700SL, it showed many electronic innovations but was not put into production.\n\n{{gallery\n|lines=4\n|File:Toyota Corona 1600 Sedan (RT81).jpg|Toyota Corona 1600 Sedan (RT82), as assembled by [[Australian Motor Industries|AMI]] in Australia, 1972 to 1974\n|File:Toyopet Corona Van T80.jpg|Toyopet Corona Van (T80), pre-facelift 1970\u201371 model\n|File:1972 Toyota Corona Coupe (33536436546).jpg|1972 Toyota Corona Coupe\n|File:1973 Toyota Corona (RT81) SE sedan (2015-08-09) 05.jpg|Toyota Corona (RT81) SE sedan (Australia)\n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T100|T110|T120}} Fifth generation (T100, T110, T120; 1973\u20131979) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fifth generation (T100/T110/T120)\n| image = 1975 Toyota Corona (RT104) SE sedan (2015-06-18) 01.jpg\n| caption = 1975 Toyota Corona SE sedan\n| aka = Toyota 2000 (UK market)<ref>Graham Robson, A-Z of Cars of the 1970s, 1990, p. 155</ref>\n| production = Aug 1973<ref name=\"VIM\" />\u2014May 1979<ref name=\"VIM\" />\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list\n  | Japan: [[Toyota, Aichi]] ([[Toyota Tsutsumi plant|Tsutsumi plant]])\n  | Australia: [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]] ([[Australian Motor Industries|AMI]])\n  | Indonesia: [[Tanjung Priok]], [[North Jakarta]] (PT.

Chassis codes 100\u2013105 were reserved for sedans, with 106\u2013109 for vans, the 110\u2013115 was for the hardtop coup\u00e9 while 116\u2013119 was for the wagon versions. The 120-series model codes were used for late series face lifted models in the Japanese market fitted with the new emissions control [[Toyota TTC|TTC-C]] motors. The two-speed automatic was no longer offered. The face lift revised the hood and grille, and enlarged the tail lights. The station wagon featured optional wood panel body claddings. Engines were 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre [[SOHC]] units. In North America, the 20R 2.2-litre engine was used.\n\nThe high-performance '''2000GT''' Sedan and Hardtop Coup\u00e9 with 18R-G twin cam engine were only offered in Japan. Yamaha supplied the alloy head for these high performance normally aspirated engines fitted with twin Mikuni-Solex 40 mm side-draft carburettors and a compression ratio of 9.7:1. Gearbox was the Porsche-type syncromesh 5-speed P51 coupled to a 4.1 F series limited slip differential, giving a claimed top speed of {{cvt|200|km/h|mph|round=5}}.\n\n[[File:1973 Toyota Corona 01.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Corona sedan (RT102, Japan)]]\n\nNorth American models had longer bumpers (hiding recoverable bumper shocks) to meet local {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} impact standards; they gained standard radial tires in 1975. Side door impact upgrades were installed in all doors. This series also saw the standard (on some models) Electro Sensor Panel which monitored fluid and bulb status. As with earlier Coronas, some models had a shifter mounted on the steering column. Sales of the Corona continued to grow as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The two-door hardtop continued, with trim levels 1600GL, 1800SR and the 2000SR, with the coup\u00e9 proving popular in the USA but more popular yet in Japan. The two-door sedan, meanwhile, sold well in the United States but very little in Japan, and this was the last Corona to be offered in this bodystyle.\n\nThe Corona saw new competitors in both Japan, Europe and the United States from the [[Honda Accord]] in 1976, and the [[Subaru Leone|Subaru DL]] in 1974. The advantage the Honda and Subaru had over the Corona was that both vehicles were [[front-wheel-drive]], while the Corona was [[rear-wheel-drive]]. In response to the Japanese Governments passage of emission control regulations, Toyota introduced the [[Toyota TTC]]-V (Vortex) on the {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 19R engine only, using an [[Exhaust gas recirculation]] implementation. In Japan, the 12R-U engine was designed to run on LPG for taxi usage, starting in October 1975. To meet new emissions regulations the 1.6-litre 12R engine was replaced by the more modern 2T-J in commercial models. The 18R-E engine with fuel injection that was used in the 2000SL and 2000SR discontinued production due to emission issues. In November 1975, the 1800 saw the removal of the twin carburetors due to emission regulations, which meant the discontinuation of the 1800SR coup\u00e9. June 1976 saw the installation of a catalyst system included with the TTC-C system.\n\nJanuary 1977 saw a minor appearance change to both the interior and exterior, with a revised grille and hood, as well as new headlight surrounds. The taillights were also modified; while still rectangular, they were less busy in appearance.<ref name=CarZA1178>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Wright |editor-first=Cedric |date=September 1978 |title=Toyota Corona SL 2000 sports sedan |magazine=CAR |volume=22 |number=8 |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Ramsay, Son & Parker (Pty) ltd. |page=54}}</ref>\n\nNew Zealand assembly began with 1.6 OHV, three-speed manual column shift and bench front seat and 1.8-litre 16R OHC four-speed manual bucket front seat options.

It maintained the standard front-engine / [[rear-wheel-drive]] layout of all Coronas that preceded it. The T130 series was available in a wide range of body styles across various markets including a [[Sedan (automobile)|four-door Sedan]], two-door [[hardtop]] [[Coup\u00e9|coupe]], [[Station wagon|four-door wagon]] and new [[Liftback|five-door liftback]], which featured a 40:60 split fold rear seat. The assignment of \"T130\" to all Corona body styles signified a new approach, instead of a different series number identifier for different body styles. This was also the first Corona to be sold as a \"Toyota\" rather than a \"Toyopet\" in the Japanese domestic market.<ref name=toyGB>{{cite web | url = hhttps://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/vehicle_lineage/car/id60008067/index.html | archivedate = 2018-12-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181205052353/https://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/vehicle_lineage/car/id60008067/index.html | title = 6th Corona Van: Spec | work = Vehicle Lineage | publisher = Toyota Motor Corporation | id = 60008067 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1983 Toyota Corona (RT133) XX sedan (20151955750).jpg|thumb|left|Corona XX sedan (Australia; facelift)]]\n[[File:1983 Toyota Corona (RT133) XX sedan (20331445642).jpg|thumb|left|Corona XX sedan (Australia; facelift)]]\n\nAll models featured [[MacPherson strut]] [[independent front suspension]] as well as a four-link [[trailing arm]] rear suspension arrangement with a [[Panhard rod]], except for the wagon, which used leaf springs, like the Corolla and Cressida wagons. [[Disc brakes]] were fitted as standard equipment on the front of all models. Rear disc brakes were fitted as standard on the 2000GT and 2000SL, which were not available to all international markets. Other models were fitted with rear [[drum brakes]].\n\nThe Corona range received a thorough facelift in August 1980, with new rearwards sloping rectangular headlights which gave it a more modern appearance at the front.\n\nThe T130 series was manufactured with a wide range of engine and transmission combinations. 1.6-litre [[Toyota R engine#12R|12R]], [[Toyota T engine#2T|2T]] (and associated [[Toyota T engine#12T|12T]]) and 2.0-litre [[Toyota R engine#18R|18R]] engines are the most common. The LPG-powered 12R engine became available in the Japanese domestic market in February 1979 and, along with the LPG-powered 5R engined model, continued to be built until August 1982.<ref name=JdmPartsCat130 /> The rest of the Corona range was taken out of production for the Japanese market in December 1981. Amongst other minor changes, the 1.8-litre [[Toyota T engine#3T|3T]] / [[Toyota T engine#13T|13T]] engine was added in 1981 to replace the 1.6-litre 2T / 12T. The North American Corona shared the 2.2-litre [[Toyota R engine|20R]] engine with the Celica. Emission regulations passed in 1978 were applied across the range of models offered. The 1.8L engine was equipped with electronic fuel injection as well as the 2.0L engine. In Japan the venerable 2.0L [[Toyota R engine#18R-G|18R-G]] was offered in the range-topping 2000GT, developing 101&nbsp;kW (135&nbsp;hp) at 5800 rpm.\n\nThe station wagon was, as usual at the time, marketed as a \"light van\" in Japan. This was registered as a commercial vehicle for certain tax benefits and less restrictive emissions standards. When introduced, the Corona Van was available as a 1600 (TT137V) or an 1800 (RT137V), both using engines not installed in the rest of the range. The ''2T-J'' in the 1600 Standard produces {{convert|93|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000&nbsp;rpm while the DX and GL models' 1.8-liter 16R offered {{convert|95|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm but with considerably more torque.<ref name=toyGB/> The 2T and 16R were both replaced by the newer ''12T-J'' engine in December 1979, reflecting newly tightened emissions standards for commercial vehicles in Japan.<ref name=JdmPartsCat130 /> This model, the TT138V, produces {{convert|86|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=Catvol27>{{citation | ref = JAMA27 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1980/1981 | language = Japanese | volume = 27 | date = 1980-10-20 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 194 | id = 053-800027-3400 }}</ref>\n\n===Markets===\n;United States\nThe T130 was the last Corona to be marketed in the USA. It was offered as a sedan, wagon, or liftback with either Base or LE (Luxury Edition) equipment. In North America, the Corona was replaced for the 1983 model year by the similarly sized but [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] sedan and five-door hatchback. Since then, the Camry has grown a size larger than the Corona and its sportier [[Toyota Carina|Carina]] sister car. The Corona was originally fitted with the 2.2-litre [[Toyota R engine#20R|20R]] engine, but along with a facelift for 1981 this was switched to the 2367&nbsp;cc [[Toyota R engine#22R|22R]] with {{convert|96|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4800&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=RT121>{{cite magazine | magazine =Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 |issue=January\u2013February 1981 |title=1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 121 | publisher = CBS Publications }}</ref> The facelift version received a rearward-sloping front end and a modestly restyled rear; North American cars received quad rectangular headlamps and a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed automatic.\n\n;Australia\nTo meet an 85 percent overall local parts content as a manufacturer, [[Toyota Australia]] chose to manufacture Corona sedans and wagons using 1.9-litre [[Holden Starfire engine#Starfire|Holden ''Starfire'' engines]].<ref name=Whatcar>{{Citation | title=What car is that? : in Australia & New Zealand | editor-last=Boyce | editor-first=David | ref = DB1 | year=1981 | publisher=Rigby | location=Adelaide, Australia | page = 169 | isbn=0727014803 }}</ref> As installed by Toyota, the engine received some minor changes in the form of its own camshaft, manifold, and carburettor.<ref name=Whatcar/> In Toyota engine terminology it received ''1X'' badging and was coupled with a four-speed or optional five-speed [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] 505.

The 1.6-litre was soon changed to the newer ''2T'' engine, coupled with a four-speed manual and bucket front seats. Later in the run, Toyota NZ added a locally assembled Liftback version with the 1.8-litre engine and manual or automatic transmission.

Both models were available in either sedan or wagon body styles. The lower S and CS trim levels (2.0-litre) were fitted standard with a four-speed manual transmission (optional five-speed manual and three- or four-speed automatic). The top trim level was the 2.0-litre CS-X until November 1984 when replaced by the 2.4-litre CSi and luxury Avante models (2.0- and 2.4-litre).\n\nToyota released a limited edition Olympic model in 1984, offering a full digital instrument cluster in either manual or automatic and in both sedan and wagon body variants. In 1985, a limited edition SR model was offered in white and manual transmission only with front and rear spoilers, white painted grille and side mirrors, white highlights in the tail lamps (instead of black), SR lettering on the boot lid, red exterior pinstriping, sports front seats with red pin stripes, and a three-spoke leather steering wheel.\n\nToyota Australia introduced a facelift in November 1985. This included the addition the former CS-X grille insert for the S model and the Avante grille for the CS and CSi. There were also new wheels trims on all versions and revised tail lamp lenses.

For this generation, the new Corona EXiV four-door hardtop would have to do for those looking for something extra. This was the last generation to offer the Corona GT to Japanese buyers, equipped with Toyota's [[active suspension]] technology called [[Toyota TEMS|TEMS]] included with their \"PEGASUS\"-branded four-wheel independent suspension and \"LASRE\"-branded multi-port fuel injection technology on the 3S-GELU engine.\n\nThe five-door Corona liftback was sold as the \"Corona SF\" in Japan, in a much smaller lineup than the four-door sedan. The five-door model proved much more popular in Europe, where, confusingly, it was marketed as the '''[[Toyota Carina II|Carina II]]'''. The sedan and a wagon were also part of the Carina II lineup, which was a rebadged Corona rather than the T170 Carina sold in Japan. The lightly restyled Carina T170 series derivative was launched in Japan in December 1987.\n\nA limited production Corona was sold only in Japan in May 1990, to celebrate 10 million Corona's having been sold, called the Corona Super Roomy.

In Europe, the Corona was known as the '''Toyota Carina E''' and it replaced the Carina II (T170). The Carina E was built at Toyota's new factory at [[Burnaston]], near [[Derby]], England, United Kingdom, but the early cars and all GT-i models were built in Tsutsumi, Japan. The cars were imported in Europe from the third quarter of 1992 until the opening of the Burnaston factory in December that year.\n\nFor the Japanese domestic market, the Corona's platform twin the Carina received different bodywork.\n\nThis generation of Corona received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s. The exterior dimensions and engine sizes remained in compliance with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese size regulations]] so as to continue to offer a product for Japanese buyers wanting to reduce their annual tax liability.\n\nThe five-door model was called the '''Corona SF''' in Japan, while the station wagon had become a separate line there, from 1993, called the [[Toyota Caldina]].\n\nThe T190 is the last Corona for most export markets. It was marketed as '''Corona \"Absolute\"''' in Indonesia, or '''Corona Exsior''' in the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nIn mainland Europe, the Carina E was offered in XL and GL trim levels, but in the UK they were marketed as Xi (1.6-litre), XLi (1.6, 1.8-litre), SLi (1.8-litre), GLi (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), GTi (2.0-litre, no estate) and Executive (2.0-litre, no estate) between 1992 and 1996. Diesels were available as the 2.0-litre XLD and GLD trims. From 1996, the S (1.6-litre, hatchback only), GS (1.6, 1.8-litre), CD (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), and CDX (1.8, 2.0-litre) trims replaced the previous trim level scheme. Diesels were now the 2.0-litre GS and GL trims. The high performance GT-i with 3S-GE engine was offered in small numbers in certain European countries. All versions (apart from GTi/Executive) were available as a four-door saloon, five-door hatchback or five-door [[station wagon|estate car]]. Badged as a Carina, this was the 1993 [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]].\n\nIt was also sold in New Zealand, but not in Australia. Engines were the same as the Toyota Carina E, except there was no diesel variant. The [[station wagon]] variant was a [[Rebadging|badge-engineered]] [[Toyota Caldina]]. The sedans and liftbacks were assembled in [[Thames, New Zealand]], while the wagon was imported fully built up from Japan. The locally assembled cars also received special spring and damper combinations (again developed by racer [[Chris Amon]]) as well as some other changes.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Donn |date=March 1993 |title=Newsline: New Corona Station Wagon |magazine=New Zealand Car |volume=7 |number=5 |location=Auckland |publisher=Accent Publishing |page=13 |issn=0113-0196}}</ref>\n\nIn the Philippines, the Corona was only available with the 2.0-litre ''3S-FE'' engine throughout its production from 1993 to 1998. Early examples of the Corona T190 (ST191) looks similar to the 1992 Japanese spec model. It only has the 2.0 EX Saloon variant, with a choice of a 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or a 4-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The 1995 model has the facelifted exterior, having the front and rear bumpers with the black trim, and the standard three-piece rear spoiler. The Exsior was introduced in 1996, this time with extended bumpers and red/amber tail lights and garnish. Another variant of the Corona Exsior was the LE, which had genuine leather seats, faux dash wood panel, and electronic air purifier/ionizer as standard equipment. It was eventually replaced in 1998 with the Toyota Camry XV20.\n\nProduction in Japan ended in 1995, but in Europe and Southeast Asia it lasted until the end of 1997, when it was replaced by the [[Toyota Avensis|Avensis]], which was also built at Burnaston.\n\n=== {{anchor|T200}} Corona EXiV (T200) ===\nThe T200 series Corona was sold as the continuation of the [[Toyota Corona EXiV]] hardtop sedan, while the Corona Coup\u00e9's successor was relocated to ''Toyota Vista Store'' locations and reintroduced as the [[Toyota Curren]].\n\n[[File:Toyota Corona Exiv 1993.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Corona EXiV]]\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n=== Caldina (1992\u20131997) ===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Toyota Caldina van.jpg\n| image2 = Toyota Caldina Van 002.JPG\n| caption2 = Caldina van\n}}\n[[File:1992 Toyota Caldina 01.jpg|thumb|Caldina (T190)]]\n\nThe first [[Toyota Caldina]] was the five-door wagon or commercial van version of the four-door sedan Toyota Corona in Japan.

The wagon was given its own identity, whereas previous station wagon versions were named Corona wagons. The Caldina was introduced as a successor to the Corona and Carina wagons, and was sold at Toyota Japanese dealerships ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]]'' and ''Toyopet Store'' locations.

[[Skateboarding trick]]s may be performed using fingers instead of feet. Tricks done on a fingerboard are inspired by tricks done on real skateboards. Professional skateboarder [[Lance Mountain]] is widely credited as making the first fingerboard, and his skit in Powell-Peralta's \"Future Primitive\" video brought fingerboarding to the skateboarders of the world in the mid-1980s. Around the same time, he wrote an article on how to make fingerboards in [[Transworld Skateboarding|TransWorld SKATEboarding]] magazine.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/>\n\nAlthough fingerboarding was a novelty within the skateboarding industry for years, as skateboarding reached enormous and widespread popularity in the late 1990s, Canadian toymaker [[Spin Master]] realized the potential for the toys, specifically for products bearing the logos and branding of real skateboarding brands, and introduced the [[Tech Deck]] brand. These fingerboards caught on during this period and the brand has since grown into a widely recognized icon in the toy business.

It is widely accepted that this is where the idea for the ramp found in [[The Search for Animal Chin]] came from. Some consider this the earliest fingerboard footage available for public viewing. That homemade fingerboard was built from [[Corrugated fiberboard|wood]], [[wiktionary:straw|tubes]], and [[toy train]] [[axle]]s.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/>\n\nFingerboards have been a peripheral part of the skateboarding industry since the late 1980s and were originally marketed as keychains. Somerville International's Fingerboard brand, established in 1987, was the first to mass-produce fingerboards with licensed-actual skateboard graphics with the introduction of the Pro-Precision board. <ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/> Since their introduction, the brand has undergone numerous changes in naming convention, product designs, and partnerships. Most notably their partnership with McDonalds to produce fingerboards for Happy Meal toys in the early 2000s. They produced a number of \"finger sport\" toys and also created the skateboarding action figure \"Finger Boy\" and \"Finger Girl\". They are also credited to the first mass-produced wooden fingerboard, utilizing parts from their 2nd generation fingerboards. One of the first companies to design and manufacture fingerboard ramps was Buckledown (Buckledown Products). Instead of a popular toy store, you had to get their products in skateboard equipment catalog such as CCS, or had to hope your local skateshop stocked a few. Buckledown holds the first U.S. Patent to a fingerboard ramp design. Shortly after, a brand called \"Berzerk\" by Hobbico produced fingerboard kit ramps out of a coroplast material. These ramps had an eerily strong resemblance to the Buckledown kit ramps. On the back of the Berzerk packaging, a website link that read \"www.techdeck.com\". What exactly ensued after their release is unclear, but finding these \"lawsuit\" era kit-ramps are few and far between. Shortly after in 1999, Tech Deck, now claimed by X-Concepts hit every toy store across the United States with a redesigned ramp kit, and a more accurate model of a skateboard compared to the Pro-Precision boards. X-Concepts followed Somerville's ideology with licensed pro graphics from major skateboard brands, as well as designs harnessed from entertainment properties such as \"Speed Racer,\" \"Woody Woodpecker,\" \"NASCAR,\" \"Heavy Metal,\" and \"Crash Bandicoot.\" As fingerboards became more prominent outside the skateboarding community, in 1999 there was a Tech Deck fashion of collecting one of each design similar to the [[Beanie Baby]] fad months prior.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/> Entertainment-based fingerboard brands couldn't compete against the urban juggernaut, and eventually disappeared. Skateboard manufacturers also caught on to the opportunity. Think's Super Mini Boards, the Deluxe Finger Banger Boards, and Shorty's Digi Decks to name a few. Skateboard Clothing/Shoe companies such as DC Shoes and ZooYork included a fingerboard with their own branding as an extra when you purchased one of their products in the early 2000s.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/>  They thus developed the fingerboard into a [[collectible]] [[toy]] and the practice into a \"form of mental skating\".<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\"/>\n\nFingerboarding is popular in Europe, Singapore, Asia and the United States, and there is growing popularity in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\"/><ref name=\"Fingerboard Events Forum\">{{cite web  | title=Fingerboard Events Forum  | publisher=Fingerboard.de  | year=2007 | url=http://fingerboard.de/  | accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref> Besides skateshops and the internet, Fingaspeak, a  fingerboard store opened in [[Steyr]], [[Austria]] although rumored to be the world's first fingerboard store, it joins a very small list of fingerboard stores that are available.<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\"/> Although the sport of fingerboarding originated in the United States over 25 years ago it has really caught on fire in the European scene. The United States is following and it is estimated that although the popularity seems to be in favor of the Europeans, the American Fingerboard scene has equal sales. This may be due to the flooding of the market and the availability of resources in the United States. Fingerboarding has evolved from a hobby to a lifestyle for some people.

Fingerboarding events feature some of the latest elaborate models and accessories; many of the manufacturers features photos and videos on their websites.\n\n==Components==\n\nThe parts of a fingerboard are: deck, grip tape (grip, rip tape, rubber tape), trucks, bushings, and wheels. The trucks and decks can easily be modified (''modding'') to reduce weight, improve smoothness or look better. The trucks are screwed to the deck by means of tiny screws. Modding tutorials can be found online. Decks are the major component of a board and where, on a standard skateboard, one would stand. There is a wide variety of decks with material ranging from wood to plastic, to paper. Most commonly, decks are made out of wood, as this gives it more \"pop\" and a more authentic feel. The average deck will have two kicks - a flared end used for leveraging the board - while some old-school models have only one end flared. During the early stages of the fingerboarding scene, decks traditionally had lower kicks like that of a Berlinwood Old Mold or a Tech Deck however, the \"default\" shape nowadays has medium kicks and low concave. Some decks have higher kicks, like Aphlikshun's K Deck, and if the kicks are very steep, they are referred to as \"wall kicks\". Some companies offer complete custom fingerboards, such as, which type of shape, graphic, or ply they want. Examples: Yellowood, Diamond Decks Fingerboard, Berlinwood, Flatface, Lowpro.\n\nGriptape is the friction tape adhered to the topside of the deck to enable users to more easily maintain control of the board. There are many types of griptape. Some use standard skateboard griptape, although the griptape may wear out faster on fingerboards as they endure more moisture from the sweat and oils of a user's hands. There are also softer alternatives and grippy tape which is less harsh on a user's fingers allowing them to fingerboard for longer periods of time. Examples of this tape are Riptape, FBS Extra Smooth, No Comply Foamy Greatness, and Yellowood's Slim Tape. Most of these are made a thin layer of foam, with adhesive on the reverse. Trucks are the structures attached to the bottom of the deck that house the wheels and bushings. Some trucks are all one molded piece while others are scaled-down versions of regular skateboard trucks. Example: BRR Trucks, Y-Trucks. As fingerboarding has evolved \"collector\" and \"pro\" versions have emerged with some brands shaped using special instruments to make them lighter and look better. [[Bushing (isolator)|Bushings]] are pliable material that provide the cushion mechanism for turning a standard skateboard but on a fingerboard help stabilize the trucks thus keeping the wheels in the same position to enable stronger tricks and visual appeal. Collector and \"pro\" brand bushings are made from many different types of squishy material, usually rubberized plastic or rubber. The wheels can determine how smooth the ride is thus what kind of \"flow\" a user's ride can be. The professional brands are traditionally made out of a variety of different materials, and have small ball-bearings inside the bearings to enhance the smoothness. A couple examples of these wheels, Flatface Wheels, Ywheels, Oak Wheels, and Winkler Wheels.\n\nTech Deck makes hard plastic as well as wooden skateboards and borrows designs from many well-known skateboard manufacturers, such as [[Blind Skateboards|Blind]], [[Flip Skateboards|Flip]], and [[Element Skateboards|Element]].<ref name = \"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/> They use grip tape, and professional graphics on most of their decks. The stock trucks on Tech Decks are made of die-cast metal and have two separate axles for the wheels to roll on.  The wheels are made out of plastic along with the bushings. Some fingerboarders prefer the feel and performance of decks made from wood. Wooden decks can be made from 3-7 plies of a given veneer; maple, walnut, and mahogany being the most popular. All of the hole-drilling and shaping is done by hand or with the aid of a machine, thus the price is higher. A wooden deck from a popular company can have a low to high price range usually depending on the quality of the deck one is to purchase, prices range from 10 - US$52. Wooden fingerboard makers are now offering custom designs; the buyer can choose from their line of graphics or send in their own. The wooden boards come in a variety of widths from 26 \u2013 32&nbsp;mm and concave can vary greatly from maker to maker. Some companies offer even more customization options such as the choosing of the plies used to go into the deck, as well as the width/length of the deck. Along with wooden decks, advanced fingerboarder's also tend to prefer bearing wheels to plastic. Bearing wheels can be made from a range of materials such as teflon, urethane, silicon, fiberglass, and even clay. The wheels are usually put into a lathe to ensure the best shape. Once the wheels have been readied, bearings are put into place to increase the smoothness of the wheels rolling on the axle. Tuning screws for the wheels cause the wheels to roll more smoothly. Rather than using the stock axles and kingpins that come on Tech Deck trucks, some more advanced fingerboards use tuning screws, softer 'foam griptape' and custom kingpins to ensure that wheels and hangars are more properly secured.

[[Skateboarding trick]]s may be performed using fingers instead of feet. Tricks done on a fingerboard are inspired by tricks done on real skateboards. Professional skateboarder [[Lance Mountain]] is widely credited as making the first fingerboard, and his skit in Powell-Peralta's \"Future Primitive\" video brought fingerboarding to the skateboarders of the world in the mid-1980s. Around the same time, he wrote an article on how to make fingerboards in [[Transworld Skateboarding|TransWorld SKATEboarding]] magazine.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/>\n\nAlthough fingerboarding was a novelty within the skateboarding industry for years, as skateboarding reached enormous and widespread popularity in the late 1990s, Canadian toymaker [[Spin Master]] realized the potential for the toys, specifically for products bearing the logos and branding of real skateboarding brands, and introduced the [[Tech Deck]] brand. These fingerboards caught on during this period and the brand has since grown into a widely recognized icon in the toy business. Toy fingerboards like Tech Decks are now available as inexpensive novelty toys as well as high-end collectibles, complete with accessories one would find in use with standard-size skateboards.<ref name=\"Life and Limb: Skateboarders\">{{cite book | last=Hocking | first=Justin |author2=Jeff Knutson |author3=Jared Jacang Maher |author4=Jocko Weyland  | title=Life and Limb: Skateboarders Write from the Deep End | publisher=Soft Skull Press | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxFdbXUDGt0C&dq=%22fingerboard%22+ng\" | accessdate=2007-12-25| isbn=9781932360288 }}</ref><ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\" /><ref name=\"Fingerboard Tuning\">{{cite web | title=Fingerboard Tuning | publisher=Fingerboardstore.de | year=2007 | url=http://www.fingerboardstore.de/shop/index.php?cPath=23 | accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref> Fingerboards are also used by skateboarders as [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] model visual aids to understand potential tricks and maneuvers;<ref name=\"The Mutt: How to Skat\">{{cite book | last=Mullen | first=Rodney |author2=Sean Mortimer | title=The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yKDJjltBon8C&pg=PA49&dq=%22fingerboard%22+mini skateboard#PPA43,M1 | accessdate=2007-12-25| isbn=9780060556181 }}</ref> many users make videos to document their efforts.\n\nSimilar to fingerboarding, although less popular, '''handboarding''' involves a scaled-down version of a skateboard that a user controls with their hands.\n\n==History==\nFingerboards were first created as homemade finger toys in the late 1960s and later became a [[Novelty item|novelty]] attached to [[Key (lock)|key]]chains in skate shops (but were also mentioned as a model for a skateboard).<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\">{{cite web|title=About Fingerboarding |publisher=Blackriver Ramps |year=2007 |url=http://www.blackriver-ramps.com/brr-blog/wordpress/?page_id=3 |accessdate=2007-12-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227104547/http://www.blackriver-ramps.com/brr-blog/wordpress/?page_id=3 |archivedate=2007-12-27 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>  In the 1985 Powell-Peralta skateboarding video \"Future Primitive,\" Lance Mountain rode a homemade fingerboard in a double-bin sink. It is widely accepted that this is where the idea for the ramp found in [[The Search for Animal Chin]] came from. Some consider this the earliest fingerboard footage available for public viewing. That homemade fingerboard was built from [[Corrugated fiberboard|wood]], [[wiktionary:straw|tubes]], and [[toy train]] [[axle]]s.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/>\n\nFingerboards have been a peripheral part of the skateboarding industry since the late 1980s and were originally marketed as keychains. Somerville International's Fingerboard brand, established in 1987, was the first to mass-produce fingerboards with licensed-actual skateboard graphics with the introduction of the Pro-Precision board. <ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/> Since their introduction, the brand has undergone numerous changes in naming convention, product designs, and partnerships. Most notably their partnership with McDonalds to produce fingerboards for Happy Meal toys in the early 2000s. They produced a number of \"finger sport\" toys and also created the skateboarding action figure \"Finger Boy\" and \"Finger Girl\". They are also credited to the first mass-produced wooden fingerboard, utilizing parts from their 2nd generation fingerboards. One of the first companies to design and manufacture fingerboard ramps was Buckledown (Buckledown Products). Instead of a popular toy store, you had to get their products in skateboard equipment catalog such as CCS, or had to hope your local skateshop stocked a few. Buckledown holds the first U.S. Patent to a fingerboard ramp design. Shortly after, a brand called \"Berzerk\" by Hobbico produced fingerboard kit ramps out of a coroplast material. These ramps had an eerily strong resemblance to the Buckledown kit ramps. On the back of the Berzerk packaging, a website link that read \"www.techdeck.com\". What exactly ensued after their release is unclear, but finding these \"lawsuit\" era kit-ramps are few and far between. Shortly after in 1999, Tech Deck, now claimed by X-Concepts hit every toy store across the United States with a redesigned ramp kit, and a more accurate model of a skateboard compared to the Pro-Precision boards. X-Concepts followed Somerville's ideology with licensed pro graphics from major skateboard brands, as well as designs harnessed from entertainment properties such as \"Speed Racer,\" \"Woody Woodpecker,\" \"NASCAR,\" \"Heavy Metal,\" and \"Crash Bandicoot.\" As fingerboards became more prominent outside the skateboarding community, in 1999 there was a Tech Deck fashion of collecting one of each design similar to the [[Beanie Baby]] fad months prior.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/> Entertainment-based fingerboard brands couldn't compete against the urban juggernaut, and eventually disappeared. Skateboard manufacturers also caught on to the opportunity. Think's Super Mini Boards, the Deluxe Finger Banger Boards, and Shorty's Digi Decks to name a few. Skateboard Clothing/Shoe companies such as DC Shoes and ZooYork included a fingerboard with their own branding as an extra when you purchased one of their products in the early 2000s.<ref name=\"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/>  They thus developed the fingerboard into a [[collectible]] [[toy]] and the practice into a \"form of mental skating\".<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\"/>\n\nFingerboarding is popular in Europe, Singapore, Asia and the United States, and there is growing popularity in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\"/><ref name=\"Fingerboard Events Forum\">{{cite web  | title=Fingerboard Events Forum  | publisher=Fingerboard.de  | year=2007 | url=http://fingerboard.de/  | accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref> Besides skateshops and the internet, Fingaspeak, a  fingerboard store opened in [[Steyr]], [[Austria]] although rumored to be the world's first fingerboard store, it joins a very small list of fingerboard stores that are available.<ref name=\"About Fingerboarding\"/> Although the sport of fingerboarding originated in the United States over 25 years ago it has really caught on fire in the European scene. The United States is following and it is estimated that although the popularity seems to be in favor of the Europeans, the American Fingerboard scene has equal sales. This may be due to the flooding of the market and the availability of resources in the United States. Fingerboarding has evolved from a hobby to a lifestyle for some people.

Fingerboarding events feature some of the latest elaborate models and accessories; many of the manufacturers features photos and videos on their websites.\n\n==Components==\n\nThe parts of a fingerboard are: deck, grip tape (grip, rip tape, rubber tape), trucks, bushings, and wheels. The trucks and decks can easily be modified (''modding'') to reduce weight, improve smoothness or look better. The trucks are screwed to the deck by means of tiny screws. Modding tutorials can be found online. Decks are the major component of a board and where, on a standard skateboard, one would stand. There is a wide variety of decks with material ranging from wood to plastic, to paper. Most commonly, decks are made out of wood, as this gives it more \"pop\" and a more authentic feel. The average deck will have two kicks - a flared end used for leveraging the board - while some old-school models have only one end flared. During the early stages of the fingerboarding scene, decks traditionally had lower kicks like that of a Berlinwood Old Mold or a Tech Deck however, the \"default\" shape nowadays has medium kicks and low concave. Some decks have higher kicks, like Aphlikshun's K Deck, and if the kicks are very steep, they are referred to as \"wall kicks\". Some companies offer complete custom fingerboards, such as, which type of shape, graphic, or ply they want. Examples: Yellowood, Diamond Decks Fingerboard, Berlinwood, Flatface, Lowpro.\n\nGriptape is the friction tape adhered to the topside of the deck to enable users to more easily maintain control of the board. There are many types of griptape. Some use standard skateboard griptape, although the griptape may wear out faster on fingerboards as they endure more moisture from the sweat and oils of a user's hands. There are also softer alternatives and grippy tape which is less harsh on a user's fingers allowing them to fingerboard for longer periods of time. Examples of this tape are Riptape, FBS Extra Smooth, No Comply Foamy Greatness, and Yellowood's Slim Tape. Most of these are made a thin layer of foam, with adhesive on the reverse. Trucks are the structures attached to the bottom of the deck that house the wheels and bushings. Some trucks are all one molded piece while others are scaled-down versions of regular skateboard trucks. Example: BRR Trucks, Y-Trucks. As fingerboarding has evolved \"collector\" and \"pro\" versions have emerged with some brands shaped using special instruments to make them lighter and look better. [[Bushing (isolator)|Bushings]] are pliable material that provide the cushion mechanism for turning a standard skateboard but on a fingerboard help stabilize the trucks thus keeping the wheels in the same position to enable stronger tricks and visual appeal. Collector and \"pro\" brand bushings are made from many different types of squishy material, usually rubberized plastic or rubber. The wheels can determine how smooth the ride is thus what kind of \"flow\" a user's ride can be. The professional brands are traditionally made out of a variety of different materials, and have small ball-bearings inside the bearings to enhance the smoothness. A couple examples of these wheels, Flatface Wheels, Ywheels, Oak Wheels, and Winkler Wheels.\n\nTech Deck makes hard plastic as well as wooden skateboards and borrows designs from many well-known skateboard manufacturers, such as [[Blind Skateboards|Blind]], [[Flip Skateboards|Flip]], and [[Element Skateboards|Element]].<ref name = \"The Fingerboard Controversy: Are\"/> They use grip tape, and professional graphics on most of their decks. The stock trucks on Tech Decks are made of die-cast metal and have two separate axles for the wheels to roll on.  The wheels are made out of plastic along with the bushings. Some fingerboarders prefer the feel and performance of decks made from wood. Wooden decks can be made from 3-7 plies of a given veneer; maple, walnut, and mahogany being the most popular. All of the hole-drilling and shaping is done by hand or with the aid of a machine, thus the price is higher. A wooden deck from a popular company can have a low to high price range usually depending on the quality of the deck one is to purchase, prices range from 10 - US$52. Wooden fingerboard makers are now offering custom designs; the buyer can choose from their line of graphics or send in their own. The wooden boards come in a variety of widths from 26 \u2013 32&nbsp;mm and concave can vary greatly from maker to maker. Some companies offer even more customization options such as the choosing of the plies used to go into the deck, as well as the width/length of the deck. Along with wooden decks, advanced fingerboarder's also tend to prefer bearing wheels to plastic. Bearing wheels can be made from a range of materials such as teflon, urethane, silicon, fiberglass, and even clay. The wheels are usually put into a lathe to ensure the best shape. Once the wheels have been readied, bearings are put into place to increase the smoothness of the wheels rolling on the axle. Tuning screws for the wheels cause the wheels to roll more smoothly. Rather than using the stock axles and kingpins that come on Tech Deck trucks, some more advanced fingerboards use tuning screws, softer 'foam griptape' and custom kingpins to ensure that wheels and hangars are more properly secured. Example: Blackriver Trucks and YTrucks. Board rails can be added to the deck bottom similar to those used on a standard skateboard. Fingerboards made with plastic are sometimes modified by heating the plastic to shape it, such as making the kicks higher or adding concavity.\n\n== Fingersnowboarding and handboards ==\n[[File:Chicken on a skateboard.JPG|thumb|A [[chicken]] on a mini-skateboard, similar to a handboard.|181x181px]]\nSimilar to fingerboarding, fingersnowboarding is [[snowboarding]] on a small-scale snowboard controlled with one's fingers.

British forces defeated the pirates in the [[Cape Fear River]] [[estuary]] which led to Bonnet's death by hanging in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring the end of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], the [[Royal Navy]] was constantly in campaign against pirates in the [[Caribbean]] and off [[North America]]. Stede Bonnet was a very successful pirate, having captured several merchant ships and assembled his own squadron of pirate ships. In August 1718, Bonnet was sailing from the [[Delaware Bay]] to the Cape Fear River. He commanded his [[sloop-of-war]] [[flagship]] ''Royal James'' and two other armed sloops, ''Francis'' and ''Fortune''. ''Royal James'' was a former flagship of [[Blackbeard]] which was armed with eight cannon. The other two sloops were similarly armed. All together, 46 pirates crewed them. ''Royal James'' was in need of [[careen]]ing and the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was soon to come so Bonnet chose the Cape Fear estuary as a reliable shelter against storms. For the next few weeks, Bonnet's crew repaired the ''Royal James'' with material salvaged from a captured [[shallop]].\n\nIn late August, reports of Bonnet's sloops in the Cape Fear River reached [[Governor]] [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] of South Carolina. Johnson ordered [[Militia]] [[Colonel]] [[William Rhett]] to command an operation to destroy the pirate threat. He did not have regular Royal Navy Sailors under his command, but locally raised sailors from [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. At the colonel's disposal were two eight-gun sloops with a combined 130 men.\n\n==Battle==\nColonel Rhett reached the Cape Fear River estuary on the night of September 26, 1718, and was sighted by Bonnet and his men. Believing the sloops to be that of merchants, the pirates boarded three [[canoe]]s and headed for the unrecognized South Carolinian expedition. It was at this time that Rhett's flagship, ''Henry'', ran aground on a [[sandbar]]. This allowed the canoes to approach close enough to discover the identity of the grounded vessel. Once they did they turned about and paddled back to their ships unharmed.\n\nInstead of fleeing up the small river in darkness, Bonnet decided that he would fight his way back to the sea, so the next morning at daylight, the pirates prepared to pass the two British sloops, which were now free of the sandbar. They dispersed amongst ''Royal James'', ''Fortune'' and ''Francis'' and loaded their arms. At daylight the following morning, Bonnet raised his [[Jolly Rodger|flag]] and attacked. They sailed for a few minutes until they came within range of the enemy ships, then opened fire with cannon and muskets. The British sloops returned fire and split up, but ''Henry'' ran aground again along with the other ship. To avoid enemy fire, Stede Bonnet steered his vessels close to the western shore of the river, and they ran aground on sand.\n\n[[File:Stede-Bonnet-Monument Charleston-SC.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''A memorial in Charleston commemorating the hanging of Stede Bonnet at White Point.'']]\nAt this point, only ''Henry'' and ''Royal James'' were within range of each other. For five to six hours, the two sides dueled, each unable to move. ''Henry'' was grounded in a position which left her crew with minimal cover from incoming fire. The opposite was true for ''Royal James'', whose hull provided a bulwark against enemy fire. During the fighting, Bonnet stayed on deck with his pistol in hand and warned that he would shoot any man who showed cowardice. The pirates' morale was good though; they cheered each other on and dared the South Carolinians to board.

British forces defeated the pirates in the [[Cape Fear River]] [[estuary]] which led to Bonnet's death by hanging in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring the end of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], the [[Royal Navy]] was constantly in campaign against pirates in the [[Caribbean]] and off [[North America]]. Stede Bonnet was a very successful pirate, having captured several merchant ships and assembled his own squadron of pirate ships. In August 1718, Bonnet was sailing from the [[Delaware Bay]] to the Cape Fear River. He commanded his [[sloop-of-war]] [[flagship]] ''Royal James'' and two other armed sloops, ''Francis'' and ''Fortune''. ''Royal James'' was a former flagship of [[Blackbeard]] which was armed with eight cannon. The other two sloops were similarly armed. All together, 46 pirates crewed them. ''Royal James'' was in need of [[careen]]ing and the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was soon to come so Bonnet chose the Cape Fear estuary as a reliable shelter against storms. For the next few weeks, Bonnet's crew repaired the ''Royal James'' with material salvaged from a captured [[shallop]].\n\nIn late August, reports of Bonnet's sloops in the Cape Fear River reached [[Governor]] [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] of South Carolina. Johnson ordered [[Militia]] [[Colonel]] [[William Rhett]] to command an operation to destroy the pirate threat. He did not have regular Royal Navy Sailors under his command, but locally raised sailors from [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. At the colonel's disposal were two eight-gun sloops with a combined 130 men.\n\n==Battle==\nColonel Rhett reached the Cape Fear River estuary on the night of September 26, 1718, and was sighted by Bonnet and his men. Believing the sloops to be that of merchants, the pirates boarded three [[canoe]]s and headed for the unrecognized South Carolinian expedition. It was at this time that Rhett's flagship, ''Henry'', ran aground on a [[sandbar]]. This allowed the canoes to approach close enough to discover the identity of the grounded vessel. Once they did they turned about and paddled back to their ships unharmed.\n\nInstead of fleeing up the small river in darkness, Bonnet decided that he would fight his way back to the sea, so the next morning at daylight, the pirates prepared to pass the two British sloops, which were now free of the sandbar. They dispersed amongst ''Royal James'', ''Fortune'' and ''Francis'' and loaded their arms. At daylight the following morning, Bonnet raised his [[Jolly Rodger|flag]] and attacked. They sailed for a few minutes until they came within range of the enemy ships, then opened fire with cannon and muskets. The British sloops returned fire and split up, but ''Henry'' ran aground again along with the other ship. To avoid enemy fire, Stede Bonnet steered his vessels close to the western shore of the river, and they ran aground on sand.\n\n[[File:Stede-Bonnet-Monument Charleston-SC.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''A memorial in Charleston commemorating the hanging of Stede Bonnet at White Point.'']]\nAt this point, only ''Henry'' and ''Royal James'' were within range of each other. For five to six hours, the two sides dueled, each unable to move. ''Henry'' was grounded in a position which left her crew with minimal cover from incoming fire. The opposite was true for ''Royal James'', whose hull provided a bulwark against enemy fire. During the fighting, Bonnet stayed on deck with his pistol in hand and warned that he would shoot any man who showed cowardice. The pirates' morale was good though; they cheered each other on and dared the South Carolinians to board. After five hours of fighting the South Carolinians had suffered 30 casualties, with nine pirates also killed or injured.<ref name=\"Konstam\">{{cite book | title =Blackbeard | first =Angus | last =Konstam | coauthors = | month = | year =2006 | publisher =John Wiley & Sons | pages =[https://archive.org/details/blackbeardameric00kons/page/194 194\u2013195] | url =https://archive.org/details/blackbeardameric00kons/page/194 | isbn =9780471758853 }}</ref>\n\nThe British sloops were downstream, and when the water began to rise in the early afternoon, Rhett's sloops were freed, while Bonnet's remained stranded.

The song was written by [[Jim Jonsin]], [[Rico Love]], Daniel Morris and [[Lil Wayne]], with Jonsin producing the song and Lil Wayne having featured vocals. The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] slow-jam serves as the [[lead single]] from ''Here I Am'' and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including a [[dubstep]]-inspired [[electronic music|electronic]] mix by [[Diplo (producer)|Diplo]] and a rap remix by [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Trey Songz]] and [[Fabolous]].\n\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rowland's second US top 20 hit (fourth top 30 overall) and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]\". It was certified [[double platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] in May 2013.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield, the director behind Rowland's previous video \"[[Forever and a Day (Kelly Rowland song)|Forever and a Day]]\" (2010). It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. Rowland sang the song with Trey Songz at the [[BET Awards of 2011|2011 BET Awards]] ceremony.\n\n==Background and release==\n''Here I Am'' was originally scheduled for release in 2010, but was pushed back numerous times. Initially the [[dance music|dance]]-influenced \"[[Commander (song)|Commander]]\" served as the album's [[lead single]] for international territories while two separate singles were serviced in the United States. \"[[Rose Colored Glasses (Kelly Rowland song)|Rose Colored Glasses]]\" for the [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] format and \"[[Grown Woman (Kelly Rowland song)|Grown Woman]]\" for the [[urban contemporary|urban]] format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/ldquocommanderrdquo-featuring-david-guetta,1372294.html |title=Kelly Rowland Scores No. 1 Hit on Billboard\u2019s Dance/Club Play Songs Chart with \"Commander,\" Featuring David Guetta |publisher=The Earth Times |author=Universal Motown Records Group |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5srof0lkH |archivedate=2011-09-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Single Plans\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a225421/kelly-rowland-alters-single-release-plans.html |title=Kelly Rowland Alters Single Release Plans |publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] slow-jam serves as the [[lead single]] from ''Here I Am'' and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including a [[dubstep]]-inspired [[electronic music|electronic]] mix by [[Diplo (producer)|Diplo]] and a rap remix by [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Trey Songz]] and [[Fabolous]].\n\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rowland's second US top 20 hit (fourth top 30 overall) and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]\".

It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. Rowland sang the song with Trey Songz at the [[BET Awards of 2011|2011 BET Awards]] ceremony.\n\n==Background and release==\n''Here I Am'' was originally scheduled for release in 2010, but was pushed back numerous times.
