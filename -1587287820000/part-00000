{"title_page": "Knossos", "text_new": " ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate.<ref>{{harvnb|Pendlebury|Evans|2003|p=35}}.</ref> Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.<ref>{{harvnb|Costis|Davaras|1957|pp=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===General features===\n[[File:Pithoi in Knossos.jpg|thumb|Magazine 4 with giant pithoi placed by the archaeologists for display. The compartments in the floor were the permanent locations of [[pithos|pithoi]], or storage jars, such as these, which stored wet and dry consumables, such as wine, oil, and grain. When full, they were multi-ton and immoveable. They were sunken for easier access to the wide mouths and for support.]]\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, [[Minoan chronology|Late Minoan]]. The palace has an interesting layout <ref>{{cite web |quote=Plot plans of the palace are given at the following sites |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/cgi-bin/gbc-drawing.cgi/Palace_at_Knossos.html/Knossos_West_Plan.gbd |title=Palace at Knossos \u00b7 Knossos, Crete |work=[[GreatBuildings]] |access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.athenapub.com/11knoss.htm |title=The Palaces of Minos at Knossos |first=Colin F. |last=Macdonald |volume=3 |issue=3 |journal=Athena Review |publisher=Athena Publications, Inc. |year=2003 |access-date=25 July 2018 |agency=The British School of Archaeology at Athens |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524083709/http://www.athenapub.com/11knoss.htm |archive-date=24 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://campus.lakeforest.edu/academics/greece/KnosPlan.html |title=Rough Plan of Mino's Palace at Knossos |access-date=25 July 2018 |work=Tours of Historical Sites}}</ref> \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers ([[pithoi]]) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n===Water management===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\n\n[[aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueducts]] brought fresh water to Kephala hill from [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] at [[Archanes]], about 10&nbsp;km away. Springs there are the source of the [[Amnisos|Kairatos]] river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through [[terracotta]] pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at [[Mycenae]].\n\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] apart from the hill. The queen's [[megaron]] contained an example of the first known water-flushing system [[latrine]] adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a [[floor drain]] or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\n\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\n\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n*Runoff system.<ref>[http://www.minoancrete.com/knossos13b.jpg JPEG image]. minoancrete.com, Ian Swindale. Retrieved on 2013-05-12.</ref> Sloped channels lead from a catchment basin.\n*Runoff system.<ref>[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~classics/greece2003/updates/week1_2/0401Knossos8Web.jpg JPEG image]. Dartmouth.edu. Retrieved on 2012-01-02.</ref> Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n===Ventilation===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had [[portico]]es and air shafts.\n\n===Minoan columns===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek [[column]]s. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a [[cypress]] tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height ([[entasis]]), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes''], Modern Antiquarian (2007)</ref> The columns at the Palace of [[Minos]] were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].\n\n===Pottery===\n[[File:Armon Knossos P1060018.JPG|thumb|200px|Pithoi, or storage jars, at Knossos]]\n{{main|Minoan pottery}}\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n===Frescoes===\n{{main|List of Aegean frescos}}\n[[File:Armon Knossos P1060030.JPG|thumb|200px|Bull-leaping fresco now in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]], the duplicate shown here is fixed to the wall of the upper throne room]]\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed [[fresco]] panel [[mural]]s, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground [[hematite]]. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh [[stucco]] with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1921|pp=532\u2013536}}.</ref>\n\nThe decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: [[human]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, [[animal]]s, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\n\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Gere|2009|loc=Chapter Four: The Concrete Labyrinth: 1914\u20131935}}.</ref>\n\n===Throne room===\n{{Main|Throne Room, Knossos}}\n[[File:Throne Hall Knossos.jpg|thumb|The throne from which the room was named, not the only throne at Knossos]]\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called [[Throne room|Throne Room]] or Little Throne Room,<ref>Matz, ''The Art of Crete and Early Greece'' Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2010, {{ISBN|1-163-81544-6}}, uses this term.</ref> dated to [[Minoan chronology|LM II]]. This chamber has an [[alabaster]] seat identified by Evans as a \"[[throne]]\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are [[gypsum]] benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a ''lustral basin'', which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\n\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\n[[File:Knossos fresco in throne palace.JPG|thumb|Griffin couchant (lying down) facing throne]]\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two [[griffins]] couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on [[seal (device)|seal rings]], which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\n\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\n\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n*The seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"[[heraldry|heraldic]] arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]] would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\n*A room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess,<ref>Peter Warren: ''Minoan Religion as Ritual Action'', Volume 72 of Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology, 1988, the University of Michigan</ref> who would have sat in the throne, either in [[effigy]], or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of [[divinity]] rather than a heraldic motif.\n<!--This statement is not NPOV. The epiphany theory is not generally accepted; it is only a theory. The chronology statement is too vague: The label of \"throne room\" could be seen as being misleading in the light of the religious aspect to the Room, and may confuse the issue of there being a \"priest-king\".  The chronology of the Throne Room must also be borne in mind.-->\n\nAdditional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\n\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n==Society==\n[[File:KnossosFrescoRepro06827.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Prince of lilies]]\" or \"Priest-king Relief\", plaster relief at the end of the Corridor of Processions, restored by Gilli\u00e9ron, believed by [[Arthur Evans]] to be a priest-king, wearing a crown with peacock feathers and a necklace with lilies on it, leading an unseen animal to sacrifice]]\nA long-standing debate between [[archaeologists]] concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a [[theocracy|theocratic]] manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of [[Bronze Age]] [[Crete]], and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the [[Mycenaeans]], although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n==Notable residents==\n[[File:Palace of Minos, Knossos, Crete - no audio.webm|thumbnail|Palace of Minos \u2013 short movie]]\n*[[Aenesidemus]] (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\n*[[Chersiphron]] (sixth century BC) architect\n*[[Epimenides]] (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\n*[[Ergoteles of Himera]] (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\n*[[Metagenes]] (6th century BC) architect\n*[[Minos]] (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Magasa, Crete|Magasa]]\n* [[Trapeza, Crete|Trapeza]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Cnossus |volume=6  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |page=44 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Cnossus |volume=6 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |pages=573\u2013574 }}\n* {{citation | ref=harv | first=D.J.

Neolithic remains are prolific in Crete. They are found in caves, rock shelters, houses, and settlements. Knossos has a thick Neolithic layer indicating the site was a sequence of settlements before the Palace Period. The earliest was placed on bedrock.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1921|pp=32\u201335}}.</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Evans]], who unearthed the palace of Knossos in modern times, estimated that c. 8,000 BC a Neolithic people arrived at the hill, probably from overseas by boat, and placed the first of a succession of [[wattle and daub]] villages (modern radiocarbon dates have raised the estimate to c. 7,000\u20136,500 BC<ref>{{cite book | title=The prehistory of Asia Minor: from complex hunter-gatherers to early urban societies | first=Bleda S | last=D\u00fcring | location=New York, NY | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2011 | page=126}}</ref>). Large numbers of clay and stone incised spools and whorls attest to local cloth-making. There are fine ground axe and mace heads of colored stone: [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]], [[serpentinite|serpentine]], [[diorite]] and [[jadeite]], as well as [[obsidian]] knives and arrowheads along with the cores from which they were flaked. Most significant among the other small items were a large number of animal and human figurines, including nude sitting or standing females with exaggerated breasts and buttocks. Evans attributed them to the worship of the Neolithic [[mother goddess]] and figurines in general to religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1921|pp=36\u201355}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Emprunte d'un sceau de Cnossos.jpg|thumb|left|Goddess image found at Knossos (note the tufts on the tails)]]\nAmong the items found in Knossos is a Minoan depiction of a goddess flanked by two lionesses that shows a goddess who appears in many other images.\n\n[[John Davies Evans]] (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic.<ref>{{cite book | title=Architecture of Minoan Crete: constructing identity in the Aegean Bronze Age | first=John C | last=McEnroe | location=Austin | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=2010 | pages=12\u201317}}</ref> In the [[Aceramic Neolithic]], 7,000\u20136,000 BC, a hamlet of 25\u201350 persons existed at the location of the Central Court. They lived in [[wattle and daub]] huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of [[exogamy]], living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\n[[File:Neolithic pottery, AMH, 079001.jpg|thumb|300px|Bowl with fork handles, pottery. Knossos, Early Neolithic, 6,500\u20135,800 BC. Also a ladle, and a three-legged vessel from later periods]]\nIn the [[Early Neolithic]] (6,000\u20135,000 BC), a village of 200\u2013600 persons occupied most of the area of the palace and the slopes to the north and west. They lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on [[socle (architecture)|socle]]s of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the center of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered {{convert|50|m2|sqft| abbr=on}}. The walls were at right angles. The door was centered. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.\n\nThe settlement of the [[Middle Neolithic]] (5,000\u20134,000 BC), housed 500\u20131000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the center of the main room, and [[pilaster]]s and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a {{convert|100|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second story was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the [[Late Neolithic|Late]] or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4,000\u20133,000 BC), the population increased dramatically.\n\n==Minoan period==\n{{see also|Minoan civilization|Minoan pottery|Minoan chronology}}\nIt is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after c. 2,000 BC, in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including [[Malia, Crete|Mallia]], [[Phaistos|Phaestos]] and [[Zakros|Zakro]]. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at [[Ugarit]] on the Syrian coast and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] on the upper Euphrates.<ref name=\"BM9\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before c. 1,700, almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By c. 1,650, they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces (c. 1,650\u2013c. 1,450) marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.<ref name=\"BM9\"/>\n\nThe palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the ''[[pithos|pithoi]]'' that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system.<ref name=\"BM9\"/> A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.<ref name=\"BM10\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=10}}</ref>\n\nBuilding techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.<ref name=\"BM10\"/>\n\nThe prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade.<ref name=\"BM11\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=11}}</ref> [[Herodotus]] wrote that [[Minos]], the legendary king of Knossos, established a [[thalassocracy]] (sea empire). [[Thucydides]] accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands.<ref>{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> Archaeological evidence supports the tradition because Minoan pottery is widespread, having been found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.<ref name=\"BM12\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=12}}</ref>\n\nThis also applies to the mainland, because both tradition and archaeology indicate strong links between Crete and Athens. The main legend here is the [[Minotaur]] story wherein Athens was subject to Knossos and paying tribute. The legend concerns a creature living in a labyrinth who was half-man and half-bull. Bulls are frequently featured on pottery and frescoes found at Knossos, where the intricate layout of the palace might suggest a labyrinth. One of the most common cult-symbols, often seen on palace walls, is the double-headed axe called the ''[[labrys]]'', which is a Carian word for that type of tool or weapon.<ref name=\"BM14\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=14}}</ref>\n\nAt the height of Cretan power around 1,450 BC, the palaces at Mallia, Phaestus, and Zakro were destroyed along with smaller settlements elsewhere. Only Knossos remained and it survived until c. 1,370. At the time of its destruction, it was occupied by Greeks, whose presence is suggested by a new emphasis on weapons and warfare in both art and burial. Mycenaean-style chamber tombs had been adopted and there was mainland influence on pottery styles.<ref name=\"BM17\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=17}}</ref> Confirmation came in written form after [[Michael Ventris]] deciphered the [[Linear B]] tablets and showed the language to be an early form of Greek that was quite unlike the earlier [[Linear A]]. Sir [[Arthur Evans]] found the Linear B tablets at Knossos and, although the writing was different from the Linear A ones at Phaestus and elsewhere, he thought they were a development of the first and so called them Linear B.<ref>{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|pp=17\u201318}}</ref>\n\nDespite speculation that Knossos was destroyed by the volcanic eruption on [[Santorini]], it is generally accepted that the cause was human violence following an invasion of Crete by Greeks from the [[Argolid]], most probably Mycenaean. Knossos was still prosperous at the time of its destruction c. 1,370 with trade and art continuing to thrive. Explanations for its destruction are speculative, but a likely reason is that the Mycenaeans, now prospering on the mainland, decided to remove a rival power.<ref name=\"BM19\">{{harvnb|Bury and Meiggs|1975|p=19}}</ref>\n\n==Legends==\n{{main|Labyrinth}}\n[[File:Bronze Ax Messara Crete.jpg|thumb|left| A [[labrys]] from [[Messara Plain]] ]]\nIn Greek mythology, King [[Minos]] dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had [[Daedalus]] construct a [[labyrinth]], a very large maze (by some connected with the double-bladed axe, or ''[[labrys]]'') in which to retain his son, the [[Minotaur]]. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen [[Ariadne]].<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' 18.590-2.</ref> The name \"Knossos\" was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.\n\nAs far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos' discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins \"labyrinthine\".<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1894|p=281}}.</ref> Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father is an ancient Greek king named [[Aegeus]], the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth \u2013 a building like a maze \u2013 by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king's daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.\n\nAs it turns out, there probably was an association of the word ''labyrinth'', whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] world as an [[apotropaic mark]]: its presence on an object would prevent it from being \"killed\". Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. And finally, it appears in [[Linear B]] on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu<sub>2</sub>-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, ''Daburinthoio potniai'', \"to the mistress of the Labyrinth,\" recording the distribution of one jar of honey.<ref>{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ventris | first2=John | last2=Chadwick | title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1973 | edition=2nd | pages=310, 538, 574}}</ref> A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.\n\n== Hellenistic and Roman period ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nFieldwork in 2015 revealed that during the early Iron Age, Knossos was rich in imports and was nearly three times larger than indicated by earlier excavations.

In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the [[Lyttian War]] in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the [[Polyrrhenia]]ns and the [[Macedon]]ian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]].<ref>[[Polybius]], ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D53 IV 53-55].</ref>\n\nTwenty years later, during the [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)]], the Knossians were once more among Philip's opponents and, through [[Roman Republic|Roman]] and [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence.<ref>Theocharis Detorakis, ''A History of Crete'', Heraklion, 1994.</ref> With Roman aid, Knossus became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose [[Gortys]] as the capital of the newly created province [[Crete and Cyrenaica|Creta et Cyrene]].<ref name=\"unrv2\">{{cite web | url = http://www.unrv.com/provinces/crete.php | title = Crete | accessdate = 2016-11-24 | publisher = UNRV.com}}</ref> In 36 BC, Knossus became a [[Colonia (Rome)|Roman colony]] named ''Colonia Iulia Nobilis''.<ref name=Sweetman2011>{{cite journal|last1=Sweetman|first1=Rebecca J.|title=Roman Knossos: Discovering the City through the Evidence of Rescue Excavations|journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens|date=10 June 2011|volume=105|pages=339\u2013379|doi=10.1017/S0068245400000459}}</ref> The colony, which was built using [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman-style architecture]],<ref name=Sweetman2011/> was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.\n\nThe identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named [[Kephala|Kephala Hill]], elevation {{convert|85|m|ft|abbr=on}} from current sea level.

The excavations in Knossos began in 1900 by the English archaeologist Sir [[Arthur Evans]] (1851\u20131941) and his team, and continued for 35 years. Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]], to distinguish their writing from the [[pictograph]]s also present. From the layering of the palace Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.\n\nSince their discovery, the ruins have undergone a history of their own, from excavation by renowned archaeologists, education, and tourism, to occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars. This site history is to be distinguished from the ancient.\n\n==Palace complex==\nThe features of the palace depend on the time period. Currently visible is an accumulation of features over several centuries, the latest most dominant. Thus, the palace was never exactly as depicted today. In addition, it has been reconstituted in modern materials. The custom began in an effort to preserve the site from decay and torrential winter rain. After 1922, the chief proprietor, [[Arthur Evans]], intended to recreate a [[facsimile]] based on archaeological evidence. The palace is not exactly as it ever was, perhaps in places, not even close, and yet in general, judging from the work put in and the care taken, as well as parallels with other palaces, it probably is a good general facsimile. Opinions range, however, from most skeptical, viewing the palace as pure fantasy based on 1920s architecture and art deco, to most unquestioning, accepting the final judgements of Arthur Evans as most accurate. The mainstream of opinion falls between.\n\n===Location===\n[[File:Armon Knossos P1060104.JPG|thumb|200px|View to the east from the northwest corner, in the foreground is the west wall of the Lustral Basin]]\n[[File:Knossos - 03.jpg|thumb|200px|View to the south, the hill in the background is Gypsades, between it and Knossos is the Vlychia and the South Entrance is on the left]]\n[[File:KnossosCourt.jpg|thumb|Reception courtyard in the palace of Knossos, the royal family would entertain guests here, members of the court would stand on the tiered platforms in the background]]\nFrom an archaeological point of view, the terms \"Knossos\" and \"palace\" are somewhat ambiguous. The [[palace]] was never just the residence of a monarch, although it contained rooms that might have been suitable for a royal family. Most of the structures, however, were designed to serve a civic, religious, and economic center. The term palace complex is more accurate. In ancient times, Knossos was a town surrounding and including the [[Kephala]]. This hill was never an [[acropolis]] in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground. These circumstances cannot necessarily be imputed to other Minoan palaces. [[Phaistos]], contemporaneous with Knossos, was placed on a steep ridge, controlling access to the [[Messara Plain]] from the sea, and was walled.<ref>{{cite journal | first=HR | last=Hall | title=The Mycenaean Discoveries in Crete | journal=Nature | volume=67 | number=1725 | date=November 20, 1902 | page=58 | doi=10.1038/067057a0| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1429412 }}</ref> To what degree Minoan civilization might be considered warlike remains debatable. It can, however, be said that Knossos bore no resemblance to a Mycenaean citadel, whether before or during Mycenaean Greek occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe complex was constructed ultimately around a raised central court on the top of Kephala. The previous structures were razed and the top was made level to make way for the court. The court is oblong, with the long axis, which points north-northeast, generally described as pointing \"north\". Plot plans typically show the court with the long axis horizontal, apparently east-west with the north on the right, or vertical with the north on the top. Either arrangement is confusing unless the compass points are carefully marked. About {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north of the palace complex is the sea at the Port of Heraklion. Directly to the south is Vlychia Stream, an east-west tributary of the north-south [[Kairatos]]. Kephala is an isolated hill at the confluence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe Kairatos River reaches the sea between the modern port of Heraklion and Heraklion Airport to the east. In ancient times the flow continued without interruption. Today the stream loses itself in the sewers of Heraklion before emerging from under a highway on the shore east of the port. It flows down from higher ground at Arkhanes to the south, where part of it was diverted into the Knossos Aqueduct. The water at that point was clean enough for drinking. When it reached Knossos it became the main drain of the sewer system of a town of up to 100,000 people, according to Pendlebury's estimate.<ref>{{harvnb|Pendlebury|Evans|2003|p=35}}.</ref> Today the population is mainly to the north, but the sewer function continues, in addition to which much of the river is siphoned off, and the water table is tapped for irrigation. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, where the Minoans quarried their gypsum. The limestone was quarried from the ridge on the east.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe archaeological site, Knossos, refers either to the palace complex or, to that complex and several houses of similar antiquity nearby, which were inadvertently excavated along with the palace. To the south across the Vlychia is the Caravanserai. Further to the south are Minoan houses. The Minoan Road crossed the Vlychia on a Minoan Bridge, immediately entering the Stepped Portico, or covered stairway, to the palace complex. Near the northwest corner of the complex are the ruins of the House of the Frescoes. Across the Minoan Road entering from the northwest is the Arsenal. On the north side of the palace is the Customs House and the Northeast House. From there to the northeast is the modern village of Makrotoichos. Between it and the palace complex is the Royal Villa. On the west side is the Little Palace.<ref>{{harvnb|Costis|Davaras|1957|pp=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south. The excavated ancient Royal Road is part of the complex. The junction of the ancient and the modern roads is partly over the Little Palace. Just to the northwest of there, off the modern road, is where Evans chose to have Villa Ariadne built as his home away from home and an administrative center. The villa is on a slope overlooking the ruins. At the edge of the property, on the road, is a pre-excavation house renovated many times as a residence for the official keeper, called the Taverna. Immediately to the south of the villa, over parts of the Little Palace, is the modern Stratigraphical Museum, a square building. Excavation continues sporadically on its grounds. To the south of the museum is a modern settlement across from the entrance to the west court. Parking facilities are to the north, off Leoforos Knosou. A band of fields has been left on the northwest between the palace complex and the city streets of Heraklion. The east and west are protected by north-south mountain ridges, between which is the valley of the Kairatos.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===General features===\n[[File:Pithoi in Knossos.jpg|thumb|Magazine 4 with giant pithoi placed by the archaeologists for display. The compartments in the floor were the permanent locations of [[pithos|pithoi]], or storage jars, such as these, which stored wet and dry consumables, such as wine, oil, and grain. When full, they were multi-ton and immoveable. They were sunken for easier access to the wide mouths and for support.]]\n\nThe great palace was built gradually between 1,700 and 1,400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destructions. Structures preceded it on Kephala hill. The features currently most visible date mainly to the last period of habitation, which Evans termed, [[Minoan chronology|Late Minoan]]. The palace has an interesting layout <ref>{{cite web |quote=Plot plans of the palace are given at the following sites |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/cgi-bin/gbc-drawing.cgi/Palace_at_Knossos.html/Knossos_West_Plan.gbd |title=Palace at Knossos \u00b7 Knossos, Crete |work=[[GreatBuildings]] |access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.athenapub.com/11knoss.htm |title=The Palaces of Minos at Knossos |first=Colin F. |last=Macdonald |volume=3 |issue=3 |journal=Athena Review |publisher=Athena Publications, Inc. |year=2003 |access-date=25 July 2018 |agency=The British School of Archaeology at Athens |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524083709/http://www.athenapub.com/11knoss.htm |archive-date=24 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://campus.lakeforest.edu/academics/greece/KnosPlan.html |title=Rough Plan of Mino's Palace at Knossos |access-date=25 July 2018 |work=Tours of Historical Sites}}</ref> \u2013 the original plan can no longer be seen due to the subsequent modifications. The 1,300 rooms are connected with corridors of varying sizes and direction, which differ from other contemporaneous palaces that connected the rooms via several main hallways. The {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms (also called magazines). Within the storerooms were large clay containers ([[pithoi]]) that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were processed at the palace, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses. Beneath the pithoi were stone holes that were used to store more valuable objects, such as gold. The palace used advanced architectural techniques: for example, part of it was built up to five stories high.\n\n===Water management===\nThe palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.\n\n[[aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueducts]] brought fresh water to Kephala hill from [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] at [[Archanes]], about 10&nbsp;km away. Springs there are the source of the [[Amnisos|Kairatos]] river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through [[terracotta]] pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. No hidden springs have been discovered at [[Mycenae]].\n\nSanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] apart from the hill. The queen's [[megaron]] contained an example of the first known water-flushing system [[latrine]] adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a [[floor drain]] or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.\n\nAs the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.\n\nSome links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.\n*Runoff system.<ref>[http://www.minoancrete.com/knossos13b.jpg JPEG image]. minoancrete.com, Ian Swindale.

Dartmouth.edu. Retrieved on 2012-01-02.</ref> Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.\n\n===Ventilation===\nDue to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had [[portico]]es and air shafts.\n\n===Minoan columns===\nThe palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek [[column]]s. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a [[cypress]] tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height ([[entasis]]), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes''], Modern Antiquarian (2007)</ref> The columns at the Palace of [[Minos]] were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].\n\n===Pottery===\n[[File:Armon Knossos P1060018.JPG|thumb|200px|Pithoi, or storage jars, at Knossos]]\n{{main|Minoan pottery}}\nPottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. It is used as a layer diagnostic. Comparing it to similar pottery elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, Evans established a wider chronology, which, on that account, is difficult to question successfully. On the negative side, careful records of the locations of some objects were not always kept, due to the very size of the project and the difficulties under which the archaeologists and workmen had to labor.\n\n===Frescoes===\n{{main|List of Aegean frescos}}\n[[File:Armon Knossos P1060030.JPG|thumb|200px|Bull-leaping fresco now in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]], the duplicate shown here is fixed to the wall of the upper throne room]]\nThe palace at Knossos was a place of high color, as were Greek buildings in the classical period, and as are Greek buildings today. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background coloring, the walls displayed [[fresco]] panel [[mural]]s, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground [[hematite]]. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh [[stucco]] with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1921|pp=532\u2013536}}.</ref>\n\nThe decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: [[human]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, [[animal]]s, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.\n\nSome archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Gere|2009|loc=Chapter Four: The Concrete Labyrinth: 1914\u20131935}}.</ref>\n\n===Throne room===\n{{Main|Throne Room, Knossos}}\n[[File:Throne Hall Knossos.jpg|thumb|The throne from which the room was named, not the only throne at Knossos]]\nThe centerpiece of the \"Minoan\" palace was the so-called [[Throne room|Throne Room]] or Little Throne Room,<ref>Matz, ''The Art of Crete and Early Greece'' Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2010, {{ISBN|1-163-81544-6}}, uses this term.</ref> dated to [[Minoan chronology|LM II]]. This chamber has an [[alabaster]] seat identified by Evans as a \"[[throne]]\" built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are [[gypsum]] benches. A sort of tub area is opposite the throne, behind the benches, termed a ''lustral basin'', which means that Evans and his team saw it as a place for ceremonial purification.\n\nThe room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly, to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.\n\n[[File:Knossos fresco in throne palace.JPG|thumb|Griffin couchant (lying down) facing throne]]\nThe throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two [[griffins]] couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on [[seal (device)|seal rings]], which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.\n\nThe actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.\n\nThe two main theories are as follows:\n*The seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the \"[[heraldry|heraldic]] arrangement\" of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]] would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The \"lustral basin\" and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, \"priest-king.\"\n*A room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess,<ref>Peter Warren: ''Minoan Religion as Ritual Action'', Volume 72 of Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology, 1988, the University of Michigan</ref> who would have sat in the throne, either in [[effigy]], or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of [[divinity]] rather than a heraldic motif.\n<!--This statement is not NPOV. The epiphany theory is not generally accepted; it is only a theory. The chronology statement is too vague: The label of \"throne room\" could be seen as being misleading in the light of the religious aspect to the Room, and may confuse the issue of there being a \"priest-king\".  The chronology of the Throne Room must also be borne in mind.-->\n\nAdditional speculation is, since the indentation of the seat seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks, that the throne was made specifically for a female individual. Also, the extensive use of curved edges and the crescent moon carved at its base both symbolize femininity.\n\nThe lustral basin was originally thought to have had a ritual washing use, but the lack of drainage has more recently brought some scholars to doubt this theory. It is now speculated that the tank was used as an aquarium, or possibly a water reservoir.\n\n==Society==\n[[File:KnossosFrescoRepro06827.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Prince of lilies]]\" or \"Priest-king Relief\", plaster relief at the end of the Corridor of Processions, restored by Gilli\u00e9ron, believed by [[Arthur Evans]] to be a priest-king, wearing a crown with peacock feathers and a necklace with lilies on it, leading an unseen animal to sacrifice]]\nA long-standing debate between [[archaeologists]] concerns the main function of the palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a [[theocracy|theocratic]] manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos in the administration of [[Bronze Age]] [[Crete]], and whether Knossos acted as the primary center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned in the early part of the fifteenth century BC, possibly by the [[Mycenaeans]], although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.\n\n==Notable residents==\n[[File:Palace of Minos, Knossos, Crete - no audio.webm|thumbnail|Palace of Minos \u2013 short movie]]\n*[[Aenesidemus]] (first century BC) sceptical philosopher\n*[[Chersiphron]] (sixth century BC) architect\n*[[Epimenides]] (sixth century BC) seer and philosopher-poet\n*[[Ergoteles of Himera]] (fifth century BC) expatriate Olympic runner\n*[[Metagenes]] (6th century BC) architect\n*[[Minos]] (mythical) Father of the Minotaur\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Magasa, Crete|Magasa]]\n* [[Trapeza, Crete|Trapeza]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Cnossus |volume=6  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |page=44 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Cnossus |volume=6 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |pages=573\u2013574 }}\n* {{citation | ref=harv | first=D.J.
