Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. \n\n==Premise==\nThe original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Osomatsu-kun#Characters|l1=Characters in Osomatsu-kun}}\n===Matsuno siblings===\n\n[[File:Osomatsu Matsuno siblings.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu.

Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. \n\n==Premise==\nThe original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Osomatsu-kun#Characters|l1=Characters in Osomatsu-kun}}\n===Matsuno siblings===\n\n[[File:Osomatsu Matsuno siblings.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu.

In 1944, it was renamed '''Weir Cook Municipal Airport''', after [[US Army Air Forces]] Col. [[Harvey Weir Cook]] of [[Wilkinson, Indiana]], who became a [[flying ace]] during World War I with seven victories and died flying a [[P-39]] over [[New Caledonia]] in World War II.\n\nSince 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the [[Indianapolis Airport Authority]] (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, [[Hendricks County, Indiana|Hendricks]] and [[Hamilton County, Indiana|Hamilton]] counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn 2008, the board named the new main passenger facility the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal and the new entrance road Col. H.

This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D) and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St. Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later [[US Airways]]) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the [[Midwest]]. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based [[ATA Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[Chicago Express Airlines|Chicago Express]]/[[ATA Connection]]. After that airline entered [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\nATA's demise gave [[Northwest Airlines]] an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South.

Harvey Weir Cook. It has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can also function as domestic gates). Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends.\n\nThe new terminal allows international arrivals to go through customs in the main passenger terminal; these passengers used to disembark in a separate building. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.\n\nThe A concourse has a Delta [[Sky Club]], the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since USAir closed its hub. The lounge opened on November 15, 2010.\n\n===Ground transportation===\nEight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as [[IndyGo]] bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} on each of its levels.

In 1944, it was renamed '''Weir Cook Municipal Airport''', after [[US Army Air Forces]] Col. [[Harvey Weir Cook]] of [[Wilkinson, Indiana]], who became a [[flying ace]] during World War I with seven victories and died flying a [[P-39]] over [[New Caledonia]] in World War II.\n\nSince 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the [[Indianapolis Airport Authority]] (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, [[Hendricks County, Indiana|Hendricks]] and [[Hamilton County, Indiana|Hamilton]] counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn 2008, the board named the new main passenger facility the Col. H.

This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D) and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St. Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later [[US Airways]]) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the [[Midwest]]. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based [[ATA Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[Chicago Express Airlines|Chicago Express]]/[[ATA Connection]]. After that airline entered [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\nATA's demise gave [[Northwest Airlines]] an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Northwest was later acquired by [[Delta Air Lines]] in late 2008.\n\nIn 1994, [[BAA plc|BAA]] was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport.

Harvey Weir Cook. It has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can also function as domestic gates). Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends.\n\nThe new terminal allows international arrivals to go through customs in the main passenger terminal; these passengers used to disembark in a separate building. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.\n\nThe A concourse has a Delta [[Sky Club]], the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since USAir closed its hub. The lounge opened on November 15, 2010.\n\n===Ground transportation===\nEight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as [[IndyGo]] bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} on each of its levels.
