It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Chef Pee Pee and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Chef Pee Pee stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

Since 2015, the two also compete in the Palmetto Series, which is an athletic, head-to-head competition between both schools, not just in football, but also more than a dozen competitions throughout each school year. Both institutions are public universities supported by the state of [[South Carolina]], and their campuses are separated by only 132 miles. USC and Clemson have been bitter rivals since 1896, and a heated rivalry continues to this day for a variety of reasons, including the historic tensions regarding their respective charters and the passions surrounding their athletic programs.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl|Alabama\u2013Auburn rivalry]], the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|Georgia\u2013Georgia Tech rivalry]], the [[Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry]] and the [[North Carolina\u2013NC State rivalry]], the Clemson\u2013South Carolina rivalry is an in-state collegiate rivalry. This is one of a handful of rivalries where the teams are in different premier conferences: South Carolina is in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC); Clemson is in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theacc.com/#!/|title=Atlantic Coast Conference - Official Athletics Site|website=www.theacc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/SECSports/Home.aspx|title=Southeastern Conference|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince 1960, the game has been held in late November, usually on [[American football on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving]] weekend.

The opening salvo was fired by Gideon Lee, the father of Clemson's granddaughter and [[John C.

He demanded that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] nominate its candidates by the [[Primary election|primary system]], which was denied, but they did accept his request that the candidates for statewide office [[Canvassing|canvass]] the state.<ref name=\"HollisIIp151\">{{Harvnb | Hollis | 1956 | page = 151}}</ref>  Tillman proved excellent on the stump, by far superior to his Conservative opponents, and as the Democratic convention neared there was a clear groundswell of support for the acceptance of Clemson's estate.<ref>{{Harvnb | Cooper | 2005 | page = 163}}</ref>\n\n===Clemson's Bequest barely wins support===\nTillman explained his justification for an independently controlled agriculture college by pointing to the mismanagement and political interference of the University of South Carolina as had occurred during Reconstruction.  The agriculture college, as specified in Clemson's will, was to be privately controlled.

Carolina won that game 12\u20136 and a new tradition was born \u2013 Big Thursday.  Clemson would win the next four contests (including a 51\u20130 win in 1900, still the largest margin of victory by either team in the series) before the 1st break in the series took place in 1901.\n\nThe Gamecock mascot made its first appearance in 1902.  In that first season as the Gamecocks, Carolina defeated a highly favored Clemson team coached by the legendary [[John Heisman]] 12\u20136.  But it was the full-scale riot that broke out in the wake of the game that is remembered most.\n\n\"The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail,\" Jay McCormick said.  \"Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance.  After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble.

The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909. The Carolina\u2013Clemson game has been played every year since.\n\n[[File:Clemson-South Carolina game 1911-4 (Taps 1912).png|thumb|Action in the 1911 Clemson\u2013USC football game]]\n\n===World War II era===\n[[World War II]] produced one of the most bizarre situations in the history of the rivalry.  Cary Cox, a football player of the victorious Clemson squad in 1942, signed up for the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] in 1943 and was placed at USC.  The naval instructors at USC ordered him to play on the football team and he was named the captain for the Big Thursday game against Clemson.  Cox was reluctant to play against his former teammates and he voiced his concerns to coach Lt. James P. Moran who responded, \"Cox, I can't promise you'll get a Navy commission if you play Thursday, but I can damn well promise that you won't get one if you don't play.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Lesesne | 2001 | page = 27}}</ref>  Cox then went out and led the Carolina team to a 33\u20136 win against Clemson.  He returned to Clemson after the war and captained the 1947 team in a losing effort to Carolina, but Cox earned his place in history as the only player to captain both schools' football teams.\n\n===Modern era \u2013 Post World War II===\n'''1946: Near riot \u2013 counterfeit tickets'''<br>\nThe 1946 game could be the most chaotic in the football series.  Two New York mobsters printed counterfeit tickets for the game. Fans from both sides were denied entrance when the duplicate tickets were discovered, which led to a near riot. To add to the wild scene, a Clemson fan strangled a live chicken at midfield during halftime.  Fans from both sides of the rivalry, many of whom who had been denied entrance, along with fans who poured out of the stands, stormed the fences and gates and spilled onto the field. It took U.S. Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]], who attended the game along with then-Governor-elect [[Strom Thurmond]], to settle down the hostile crowd.  Once order was restored, fans were allowed to stand along the sidelines, with the teams, while the second half was played to the game's conclusion.

A few minutes before Clemson football players entered the field for pre-game warm ups, a group of Sigma Nu fraternity members ran onto the field, jumping up and down and cheering in football uniforms that resembled the ones worn by the Tigers.  This caused the Clemson band to start playing \"Tiger Rag,\" which was followed by the pranksters falling down as they attempted to do calisthenics.  They would also do football drills where guys would drop passes and miss the ball when trying to kick it.  Clemson fans quickly realized that they had been tricked, and some of them angrily ran onto the field.  However, security restored order before any blows could be exchanged. The Carolina frat boys had also acquired a sickly cow they planned to bring out during halftime to be the \"Clemson Homecoming Queen\", but the cow died en route to the stadium. Carolina won the game 21\u201314.\n\n'''1963: National tragedy moves game'''<br>\nOn November 23, 1963, the Tigers and Gamecocks were set to play the annual rivalry on live national TV.

The only Carolina quarterback to do so against the Tigers was Tommy Suggs, who led the Gamecocks to three victories in a row from 1968 to 1970.\n\n'''2006: Kickers make the difference'''<br>\nClemson was leading 28\u201314 in the third quarter, with Carolina quarterback [[Blake Mitchell (American football)|Blake Mitchell]] throwing three interceptions.

The teams previously met four times during the regular season, with two games scheduled at each home field. Two of the games were played on Saturday and Sunday, and then later in the season 2 games were played during the mid-week, usually on Wednesday. Since 2010, the teams have competed against each other over the course of a single weekend: once on each home field and once at a neutral site. [[Fluor Field at the West End]] (2010, 2011, 2013-2019) in [[Greenville, SC]] and Riley Park (2012) in [[Charleston, SC]] have served as the host sites. The other instances where the teams met in neutral site games were the [[2002 College World Series]] and the [[2010 College World Series]], both times at [[Rosenblatt Stadium]] in [[Omaha, NE]]. Both schools are perennially considered to be among the top programs in the country, giving the rivalry a prominent spot in college baseball beyond the state of South Carolina.

The Gamecocks beat their rivals soundly, 12\u20134, and then beat the Tigers again, 10\u20132, the following day to advance to the national championship game. The Gamecocks fell to Texas 12\u20136 in the championship game, the last under the format where a one-game final was played.<ref>[http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/scar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/07-media-guide South Carolina Baseball Media Guide 2007], p. 111.</ref>\n\n'''2010'''<br>\nEight years later, in what has been called [[2010 College World Series|The Last Bat at Rosenblatt]], an identical situation leading to the series began.  Clemson had taken both on-campus games from South Carolina in the regular season, including a lopsided 19\u20136 victory in the rubber match, played before over 8,000 fans at [[Carolina Stadium]] in Columbia, but had lost in the \"neutral site\" game.  The Gamecocks had just come off a 12-inning win against the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] less than 24 hours before, while the Tigers had two days of rest.  However, fatigue was not a factor as the Gamecocks won the first game, 5\u20131, on a dominating complete game pitching performance by reliever Michael Roth, who had not started a game in more than a year.  Carolina won the second game the following day, 4\u20133, to advance to the championship series against [[2010 UCLA Bruins baseball team|UCLA]], who they defeated, 7\u20131 (Game 1) and 2\u20131 (Game 2) to win the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]].

Students, faculty and fans from the schools band together in an effort to collect blood before the holiday season when many are too busy to give blood. The drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. The University of South Carolina and Clemson University wrapped up their 35th annual blood drive in 2019, resulting in the second consecutive win for Clemson. Carolina now holds an 18\u201317 lead in the yearly competition.\n\nThe 2019 Carolina-Clemson Blood Drive took place on both campuses Nov 18\u201322 with students, staff, faculty and fans showing support for their favorite team by donating blood. This year's event resulted in 4,549 donors presenting to give blood. Carolina support totaled 2,108 donors, while Clemson support totaled 2,441 donors. The blood drive is sponsored by The Blood Connection and [[American Red Cross]] at the University of South Carolina with the help of the University of South Carolina Fraternity and Sorority Council<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sa.sc.edu/fsl/carolina-clemson-blood-drive/|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life - Fraternity and Sorority Life - University of South Carolina|website=www.sa.sc.edu}}</ref> in addition to the Men's Rugby team and the Gamma Lambda chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] national service fraternity at Clemson, and the two schools have collected 153,320 pints of blood over the past thirty five years. Everyone who gives blood receives a free shirt, with the graphic on the back usually featuring a Tiger and Gamecock together and a statement explaining that even though the competition is part of the rivalry, both schools share the common ground of giving blood. It is currently the largest collegiate blood drive in the country.\n\n==Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series==\nOn August 4, 2015, leaders from the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina gathered at the South Carolina State House to announce the launch of the Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series, in which the Tigers and Gamecocks will compete for the Palmetto Series trophy based primarily on head to head athletic competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|title=Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series Announced|access-date=August 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222214/http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following 13 sports will count toward the series: baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball, women's cross country, women's diving, football, men's golf, women's golf, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's tennis, women's tennis, and volleyball. These are all sports that either compete head to head or will face each other in the same tournament or meet. The winning team in each sport (including postseason) earns one point, while a half a point will be awarded if the teams evenly split a series throughout the year (example, if Carolina baseball were to win 2 of 3 from Clemson in the regular season, but Clemson later wins 2 of 3 in postseason play, both teams would be awarded half a point each for splitting their meetings). In the case of a tie in the 2015\u20132016 year, the winner of the schools' annual food drive and the average student athlete GPA will be used for tie breaker.

Both institutions are public universities supported by the state of [[South Carolina]], and their campuses are separated by only 132 miles. USC and Clemson have been bitter rivals since 1896, and a heated rivalry continues to this day for a variety of reasons, including the historic tensions regarding their respective charters and the passions surrounding their athletic programs.\n\nMuch like the [[Alabama\u2013Auburn football rivalry|Alabama\u2013Auburn Rivalry]], the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|Georgia-Georgia Tech Rivalry]], the [[Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry]] and the [[Carolina-State rivalry|North Carolina-NC State Rivalry]], the Clemson\u2013South Carolina rivalry is an in-state collegiate rivalry.

Cary Cox, a football player of the victorious Clemson squad in 1942, signed up for the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] in 1943 and was placed at USC.  The naval instructors at USC ordered him to play on the football team and he was named the captain for the Big Thursday game against Clemson.  Cox was reluctant to play against his former teammates and he voiced his concerns to coach Lt. James P. Moran who responded, \"Cox, I can't promise you'll get a Navy commission if you play Thursday, but I can damn well promise that you won't get one if you don't play.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Lesesne | 2001 | page = 27}}</ref>  Cox then went out and led the Carolina team to a 33\u20136 win against Clemson.  He returned to Clemson after the war and captained the 1947 team in a losing effort to Carolina, but Cox earned his place in history as the only player to captain both schools' football teams.\n\n===Modern era \u2013 Post World War II===\n'''1946: Near riot \u2013 counterfeit tickets'''<br>\nThe 1946 game could be the most chaotic in the football series.  Two New York mobsters printed counterfeit tickets for the game. Fans from both sides were denied entrance when the duplicate tickets were discovered, which led to a near riot. To add to the wild scene, a Clemson fan strangled a live chicken at midfield during halftime.  Fans from both sides of the rivalry, many of whom who had been denied entrance, along with fans who poured out of the stands, stormed the fences and gates and spilled onto the field. It took U.S. Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]], who attended the game along with then-Governor-elect [[Strom Thurmond]], to settle down the hostile crowd.  Once order was restored, fans were allowed to stand along the sidelines, with the teams, while the second half was played to the game's conclusion.

A few minutes before Clemson football players entered the field for pre-game warm ups, a group of Sigma Nu fraternity members ran onto the field, jumping up and down and cheering in football uniforms that resembled the ones worn by the Tigers.  This caused the Clemson band to start playing \"Tiger Rag,\" which was followed by the pranksters falling down as they attempted to do calisthenics.  They would also do football drills where guys would drop passes and miss the ball when trying to kick it.  Clemson fans quickly realized that they had been tricked, and some of them angrily ran onto the field.  However, security restored order before any blows could be exchanged. The Carolina frat boys had also acquired a sickly cow they planned to bring out during halftime to be the \"Clemson Homecoming Queen\", but the cow died en route to the stadium. Carolina won the game 21\u201314.\n\n'''1963: National tragedy moves game'''<br>\nOn November 23, 1963, the Tigers and Gamecocks were set to play the annual rivalry on live national TV.

Inspired by the pants, the underdog Tigers defeated the Gamecocks, 27\u20136.\n\n'''1981: Clemson wins a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Championship]]'''<br>\nIn 1981, [[1981 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] defeated Carolina 29\u201313 en route to the National Championship.\n\n'''1984: Black Magic'''<br>\nCarolina took their 9\u20131 record on the road to Clemson, and fell behind 21\u20133 to the Tigers. With about three minutes remaining in the game, Gamecock QB Mike Hold led an eight-play 86-yard touchdown drive and, thanks to a Clemson penalty that allowed a re-kick of a missed extra point, defeated the Tigers 22\u201321 to finish the first 10-win season in program history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2011-11-18/Sports/Gamecock_84_win_made_season_even_more_special.html|title=Gamecock '84 win made season even more special|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''1989: Orange on the road and Ford's last hurrah'''<br>\nAfter suffering two disappointing upsets to Duke and Georgia Tech, the 8\u20132 Tigers traveled to Columbia for the annual game.

Led by halfback [[Terry Allen (American football)|Terry Allen]]'s 97-yard, two touchdown first half, the Tigers rolled the Gamecocks on the ground for 355 yards en route to a 45\u20130 victory. The game would be Ford's last against South Carolina as Clemson's coach. He finished with a 7\u20133\u20131 record against the Gamecocks.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120917182036/http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112002aaa.html]</ref>\n\n'''1992: Signing the Paw'''<br>\nAfter an 0\u20135 start to begin the 1992 season (USC's first in the SEC), freshman sensation [[Steve Taneyhill]] led Carolina to four wins in his first five starts as Gamecock quarterback. With Clemson needing a win at home to become bowl-eligible, Taneyhill led his team to a 24\u201313 victory and famously signed his name with his finger on the Tiger Paw at midfield following a key second-half touchdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/3300/where-are-they-now-steve-taneyhill|title=Where are they now: Steve Taneyhill|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''1994: \"The Return\"'''<br>\nWith both teams entering the game 5\u20135 and trying to become bowl-eligible, Carolina led 14\u20137 at the half in Clemson. Gamecock RB [[Brandon Bennett]] received the kick to start the third quarter, took a few steps, then turned and threw a backward pass to the other side of the field which was caught by DB Reggie Richardson who returned the ball 85 yards to the Tigers' 6-yard line. Bennett ran it in for a touchdown on the next play, putting Carolina ahead 21\u20137 and the Gamecocks never looked back, going on to win the game 33\u20137 and clinching a bid to the Carquest Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/south_carolina/flashback/|title=A Step Ahead|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''2000: \"The Catch II\"/\"The Push-off\"'''<br>\nIn 2000, Trailing late in the game 14\u201313, Clemson quarterback [[Woody Dantzler]] connected with wide-receiver [[Rod Gardner]] for a 50-yard reception to Carolina's 8-yard line with 10 seconds remaining. Carolina fans point to a replay that seems to show Gardner pushing off Gamecock defender [[Andre Goodman]], but Clemson fans contend that the contact was mutual and incidental.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secfootballblogger.com/2008/02/09/rod-gardner-push-off-video-south-carolina-vs-clemson-2000|title=ESPN video|accessdate=October 5, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006165516/http://secfootballblogger.com/2008/02/09/rod-gardner-push-off-video-south-carolina-vs-clemson-2000/|archivedate=October 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> No penalty flag was thrown on the play, leaving Clemson kicker Aaron Hunt to kick a 25-yard field goal that gave Clemson a 16\u201314 win. Clemson fans remember this game as \"The Catch II\" while Carolina fans call it \"The Push-Off Game\".\n\n'''2001: A bicentennial win'''<br>\nIn the 200th year of the University of South Carolina, the Gamecocks hosted the Tigers at the end of a successful regular season that saw them ranked in the Top 25 every week and 7\u20133 heading into the rivalry game. Carolina jumped out to an early 20\u20139 lead behind a strong ground attack, and held on to win 20\u201315 and secure a bid to their second straight Outback Bowl. Because of the September 11 attacks, this was not the final regular season game for Clemson. The Tigers rescheduled their September 15 game (Vs. Duke) for the first weekend of December. \n\n'''2003: Most points scored by Clemson'''<br>\nIn 2003, Clemson defeated Carolina 63\u201317 to set the record for the most points scored by either team in the series.\n\n'''2004: The Brawl'''<br>\nThe [[South Carolina-Clemson brawl]] during the 2004 football game is the most recent eruption of hostilities in this rivalry.  It is also the last time [[Lou Holtz]] coached, having retired shortly thereafter.  Clemson won the game 29\u20137.  Each team had won a total of six games that year, making them technically bowl eligible.  However, both schools withdrew from bowl consideration because of the unsportsmanlike nature of the fight.\n\n'''2005: A quarterback wins 4'''<br>\nIn 2005, the two teams showed an unusual gesture of sportsmanship by meeting at midfield before the game to shake hands, putting the melee of 2004 behind them.  Clemson won this game 13\u20139, leaving the Tiger's quarterback, [[Charlie Whitehurst]], undefeated against USC in his 4 years at Clemson. The only Carolina quarterback to do so against the Tigers was Tommy Suggs, who led the Gamecocks to three victories in a row from 1968 to 1970.\n\n'''2006: Kickers make the difference'''<br>\nClemson was leading 28\u201314 in the third quarter, with Carolina quarterback [[Blake Mitchell (American football)|Blake Mitchell]] throwing three interceptions. The Gamecocks then scored 17 unanswered points, including two Mike Davis touchdown runs and a 35-yard field goal from [[Ryan Succop]] \u2013 the only points in the fourth quarter \u2013 to give the Gamecocks a 31\u201328 lead. Clemson kicker Jad Dean missed a field goal attempt wide left as time expired to give Carolina the win. This game also marked the moving of the series to the Saturday following Thanksgiving Day.\n\n'''2013: Highest Ranked Meeting'''<br>\nIn the highest-ever ranked matchup between the two teams (Clemson #6, South Carolina #10), the Gamecocks secured their fifth straight victory over the Tigers with a score of 31\u201317. Carolina took advantage of six turnovers by Clemson, including two during punt returns, to secure the victory. The win marked the Gamecocks' longest streak versus Clemson in the rivalry's history. With the win, South Carolina quarterback [[Connor Shaw]] finished his college career unbeaten at Williams-Brice Stadium.\n\n'''2019: Last Meeting'''<br>\nNo. 3 Clemson rolled to its sixth straight win over the Gamecocks, racking up 527 yards to win 38-3. South Carolina only managed 174 yards in the contest. Clemson sophomore quarterback [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] threw for 295 yards and 3 touchdowns to move the Tigers to 12-0 on the regular season. Lawrence also had 8 carries for 66 yards. The Gamecocks' loss moved them to 4-8 for the season. The Tigers rushed for 211 yards compared to the Gamecocks' 69.<ref>https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401110870</ref>\n\n===Game results===\n\n''Clemson victories are colored <span style=\"color:#F56600;\">\u2588\u2588</span> orange.

The teams previously met four times during the regular season, with two games scheduled at each home field. Two of the games were played on Saturday and Sunday, and then later in the season 2 games were played during the mid-week, usually on Wednesday. Since 2010, the teams have competed against each other over the course of a single weekend: once on each home field and once at a neutral site. [[Fluor Field at the West End]] (2010, 2011, 2013-2019) in [[Greenville, SC]] and Riley Park (2012) in [[Charleston, SC]] have served as the host sites. The other instances where the teams met in neutral site games were the [[2002 College World Series]] and the [[2010 College World Series]], both times at [[Rosenblatt Stadium]] in [[Omaha, NE]]. Both schools are perennially considered to be among the top programs in the country, giving the rivalry a prominent spot in college baseball beyond the state of South Carolina.

The Gamecocks beat their rivals soundly, 12\u20134, and then beat the Tigers again, 10\u20132, the following day to advance to the national championship game. The Gamecocks fell to Texas 12\u20136 in the championship game, the last under the format where a one-game final was played.<ref>[http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/scar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/07-media-guide South Carolina Baseball Media Guide 2007], p. 111.</ref>\n\n'''2010'''<br>\nEight years later, in what has been called [[2010 College World Series|The Last Bat at Rosenblatt]], an identical situation leading to the series began.  Clemson had taken both on-campus games from South Carolina in the regular season, including a lopsided 19\u20136 victory in the rubber match, played before over 8,000 fans at [[Carolina Stadium]] in Columbia, but had lost in the \"neutral site\" game.  The Gamecocks had just come off a 12-inning win against the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] less than 24 hours before, while the Tigers had two days of rest.  However, fatigue was not a factor as the Gamecocks won the first game, 5\u20131, on a dominating complete game pitching performance by reliever Michael Roth, who had not started a game in more than a year.  Carolina won the second game the following day, 4\u20133, to advance to the championship series against [[2010 UCLA Bruins baseball team|UCLA]], who they defeated, 7\u20131 (Game 1) and 2\u20131 (Game 2) to win the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]].

Students, faculty and fans from the schools band together in an effort to collect blood before the holiday season when many are too busy to give blood. The drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. The University of South Carolina and Clemson University wrapped up their 35th annual blood drive in 2019, resulting in the second consecutive win for Clemson. Carolina now holds an 18\u201317 lead in the yearly competition.\n\nThe 2019 Carolina-Clemson Blood Drive took place on both campuses Nov 18\u201322 with students, staff, faculty and fans showing support for their favorite team by donating blood. This year's event resulted in 4,549 donors presenting to give blood. Carolina support totaled 2,108 donors, while Clemson support totaled 2,441 donors. The blood drive is sponsored by The Blood Connection and [[American Red Cross]] at the University of South Carolina with the help of the University of South Carolina Fraternity and Sorority Council<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sa.sc.edu/fsl/carolina-clemson-blood-drive/|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life - Fraternity and Sorority Life - University of South Carolina|website=www.sa.sc.edu}}</ref> in addition to the Men's Rugby team and the Gamma Lambda chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] national service fraternity at Clemson, and the two schools have collected 153,320 pints of blood over the past thirty five years. Everyone who gives blood receives a free shirt, with the graphic on the back usually featuring a Tiger and Gamecock together and a statement explaining that even though the competition is part of the rivalry, both schools share the common ground of giving blood. It is currently the largest collegiate blood drive in the country.\n\n==Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series==\nOn August 4, 2015, leaders from the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina gathered at the South Carolina State House to announce the launch of the Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series, in which the Tigers and Gamecocks will compete for the Palmetto Series trophy based primarily on head to head athletic competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|title=Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series Announced|access-date=August 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222214/http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following 13 sports will count toward the series: baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball, women's cross country, women's diving, football, men's golf, women's golf, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's tennis, women's tennis, and volleyball. These are all sports that either compete head to head or will face each other in the same tournament or meet. The winning team in each sport (including postseason) earns one point, while a half a point will be awarded if the teams evenly split a series throughout the year (example, if Carolina baseball were to win 2 of 3 from Clemson in the regular season, but Clemson later wins 2 of 3 in postseason play, both teams would be awarded half a point each for splitting their meetings). In the case of a tie in the 2015\u20132016 year, the winner of the schools' annual food drive and the average student athlete GPA will be used for tie breaker.

The film's protagonist, Jacob, is a [[Vietnam veteran]] whose experiences prior to and during the war result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to figure out the truth.\n\n''Jacob's Ladder'' was made by [[Carolco Pictures]] ten years after being written by Rubin. Though only moderately successful upon release, the film garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]] and its plot and special effects became a source of influence for various other works such as the horror video game  ''[[Silent Hill]]''. A remake, also titled ''[[Jacob's Ladder (2019 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', was released in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 6, 1971, an American [[infantryman]], Jacob Singer, is with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Air Cavalry Division]], deployed in a village in Vietnam's [[Mekong Delta]], when his close-knit unit comes under sudden attack. As many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering [[catatonia]], convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be stabbed with a [[bayonet]] by an unseen assailant.\n\nJacob awakens in the [[New York City Subway]], where, after glimpsing what he believes to be a tentacle protruding from a sleeping homeless person, an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975, he works as a postal clerk, and lives in a rundown apartment in [[Brooklyn]] with his girlfriend, Jezebel. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. Jacob is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. He attempts to contact his regular doctor at the local [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA hospital]], but after first being told that there is no record of him ever being a patient there, Jacob is told that his doctor has died in a car explosion.\n\nAt a party thrown by friends, a [[psychic]] reads Jacob's palm and tells him that he is already dead, which Jacob dismisses as a joke. After declining to dance with her, he appears to witness an enormous tentacled creature having sex with and then impaling Jezzie through the mouth before he collapses. At home, Jacob experiences a dangerous fever, which Jezzie attempts to bring down with a painful ice bath. Jacob briefly wakes up in another reality where he lives with his wife and sons, including a still-alive Gabe. First-person perspective scenes of apparent [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter.\n\nOne of Jacob's former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences, but is soon afterwards killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob's comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is home, but his [[chiropractor]] friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Meister Eckhart]]:\n\n<blockquote>Eckhart saw [[Hell]] too. He said: \"The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you\", he said. \"They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and ... you're holding on, you'll see [[devil]]s tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really [[angel]]s, freeing you from the earth.\"</blockquote>\n\nJacob is approached by a distressed man who was seen treating his wound in a [[Medical evacuation|medevac]] helicopter and who also dragged him away from Paul's burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with [[Chemical Corps|the Army's chemical warfare division]] where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which massively increased aggression. Michael claims that, to test the drug's effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob's unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael's story triggers a vision of Jacob's wounding in Vietnam, which shows his attacker as a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family's home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. The scene turns to a [[triage]] tent in 1971 as military doctors declare Jacob dead. The doctor notes that Jacob had put up a tremendous fight to stay alive, but looked peaceful in death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Jacob \"Professor\" Singer\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Jezebel \"Jezzie\" Pipkin\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Louis \"Louie\" Denardo\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Michael Newman\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Paul Gruneger\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Mr. Geary, the lawyer\n* [[Patricia Kalember]] as Sarah\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as Frank\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as George\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Doug\n* Anthony Alessandro as Rod\n* [[Brent Hinkley]] as Jerry\n* [[S.

For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; [[Thom Mount]] of [[Universal Pictures]] said he \"loved it, but it was not for his studio\". Directors [[Michael Apted]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Ridley Scott]] all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's \"too [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]\" stories as \"Hollywood does not make [[List of ghost films|ghost movies]]\". Eventually, after ''Deadly Friend'' was filmed by [[Wes Craven]] in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Ghost'' were picked by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"st\" /> In 1988,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Adrian Lyne]], who described Rubin's work as \"certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read\", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' as he had originally planned (incidentally, [[Tom Hanks]], an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in ''Bonfire''). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] decided to take over the production of ''Jacob's Ladder'', giving Lyne a greater creative control<ref name=\"st\" /> and a budget of $25 million.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with [[Mario Kassar]], [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Andrew G.

A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was [[Robert Enrico]]'s 1962 short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'',<ref name=\"rubin\">Bruce Joel Rubin, ''Jacob's Ladder'', Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 1990.</ref> one of Lyne's favourite movies,<ref name=\"st\" /> which was in turn based on [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 short story [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|of the same title]].\n\nCast in the role of Jacob, [[Tim Robbins]] said the film presented for him \"a great opportunity to go in a different direction.

The war scenes were filmed in the [[Puerto Rico]] area of [[Vega Baja]], featuring the [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters provided by the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nAll of the film's special effect sequences were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of ''Jacob's Ladder'', Lyne used a [[body horror]] technique in which an actor is recorded shaking his head around at a low [[frame rate]], resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he was inspired by the art of the painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] when developing the effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widerscreenings.com/jacobsladder.html |title=Jacob's Ladder |publisher=Widerscreenings.com |date=|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to [[thalidomide]] deformities to achieve a greater shock effect.<ref name=\"rubin\" /> After many heated arguments,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist [[H. R.

At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, [[NATO]] code for a [[deliriant]] and [[hallucinogen]] known as [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|3-quinuclidinyl benzilate]], on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]]. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was [[Martin A. Lee]]'s book ''[[Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and Sixties Rebellion]]'', but noted that \"nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ \u2014 a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit [[Mania|maniac behavior]] \u2014 was used on U.S. troops.\"<ref name=\"st\" />\n\nAccording to Lyne's audio commentary, [[test screening]]s indicated that the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience.

The film's protagonist, Jacob, is a [[Vietnam veteran]] whose experiences prior to and during the war result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to figure out the truth.\n\n''Jacob's Ladder'' was made by [[Carolco Pictures]] ten years after being written by Rubin. It drew from several inspirations for its story and effects, including the short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'', and the paintings of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. Though only moderately successful upon release, the film garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]] and its plot and special effects became a source of influence for various other works such as the horror video game  ''[[Silent Hill]]''. A remake, also titled ''[[Jacob's Ladder (2019 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', was released in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 6, 1971, an American [[infantryman]], Jacob Singer, is with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Air Cavalry Division]], deployed in a village in Vietnam's [[Mekong Delta]], when his close-knit unit comes under sudden attack. As many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering [[catatonia]], convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be stabbed with a [[bayonet]] by an unseen assailant.\n\nJacob awakens in the [[New York City Subway]], where, after glimpsing what he believes to be a tentacle protruding from a sleeping homeless person, an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975, he works as a postal clerk, and lives in a rundown apartment in [[Brooklyn]] with his girlfriend, Jezebel. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. Jacob is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. He attempts to contact his regular doctor at the local [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA hospital]], but after first being told that there is no record of him ever being a patient there, Jacob is told that his doctor has died in a car explosion.\n\nAt a party thrown by friends, a [[psychic]] reads Jacob's palm and tells him that he is already dead, which Jacob dismisses as a joke. After declining to dance with her, he appears to witness an enormous tentacled creature having sex with and then impaling Jezzie through the mouth before he collapses. At home, Jacob experiences a dangerous fever, which Jezzie attempts to bring down with a painful ice bath. Jacob briefly wakes up in another reality where he lives with his wife and sons, including a still-alive Gabe. First-person perspective scenes of apparent [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter.\n\nOne of Jacob's former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences, but is soon afterwards killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob's comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is home, but his [[chiropractor]] friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Meister Eckhart]]:\n\n<blockquote>Eckhart saw [[Hell]] too. He said: \"The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you\", he said. \"They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and ... you're holding on, you'll see [[devil]]s tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really [[angel]]s, freeing you from the earth.\"</blockquote>\n\nJacob is approached by a distressed man who was seen treating his wound in a [[Medical evacuation|medevac]] helicopter and who also dragged him away from Paul's burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with [[Chemical Corps|the Army's chemical warfare division]] where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which massively increased aggression. Michael claims that, to test the drug's effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob's unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael's story triggers a vision of Jacob's wounding in Vietnam, which shows his attacker as a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family's home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. The scene turns to a [[triage]] tent in 1971 as military doctors declare Jacob dead. The doctor notes that Jacob had put up a tremendous fight to stay alive, but looked peaceful in death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Jacob \"Professor\" Singer\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Jezebel \"Jezzie\" Pipkin\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Louis \"Louie\" Denardo\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Michael Newman\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Paul Gruneger\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Mr. Geary, the lawyer\n* [[Patricia Kalember]] as Sarah\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as Frank\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as George\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Doug\n* Anthony Alessandro as Rod\n* [[Brent Hinkley]] as Jerry\n* [[S.

For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; [[Thom Mount]] of [[Universal Pictures]] said he \"loved it, but it was not for his studio\". Directors [[Michael Apted]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Ridley Scott]] all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's \"too [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]\" stories as \"Hollywood does not make [[List of ghost films|ghost movies]]\". Eventually, after ''Deadly Friend'' was filmed by [[Wes Craven]] in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Ghost'' were picked by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"st\" /> In 1988,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Adrian Lyne]], who described Rubin's work as \"certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read\", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' as he had originally planned (incidentally, [[Tom Hanks]], an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in ''Bonfire''). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] decided to take over the production of ''Jacob's Ladder'', giving Lyne a greater creative control<ref name=\"st\" /> and a budget of $25 million.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with [[Mario Kassar]], [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Andrew G.

A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was [[Robert Enrico]]'s 1962 short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'',<ref name=\"rubin\">Bruce Joel Rubin, ''Jacob's Ladder'', Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 1990.</ref> one of Lyne's favourite movies,<ref name=\"st\" /> which was in turn based on [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 short story [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|of the same title]].\n\nCast in the role of Jacob, [[Tim Robbins]] said the film presented for him \"a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well.\"<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain [[Dale Dye]],<ref>Almar Haflidason, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/15/dale_dye_2001_2_interview.shtml Dale Dye: Part 2 - Stop Whining at Me!], BBC, October 2003.</ref> who provided a five-day [[Recruit training|boot camp]] military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], [[Eriq La Salle]] and [[Ving Rhames]]). The war scenes were filmed in the [[Puerto Rico]] area of [[Vega Baja]], featuring the [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters provided by the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nAll of the film's special effect sequences were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of ''Jacob's Ladder'', Lyne used a [[body horror]] technique in which an actor is recorded shaking his head around at a low [[frame rate]], resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he was inspired by the art of the painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] when developing the effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widerscreenings.com/jacobsladder.html |title=Jacob's Ladder |publisher=Widerscreenings.com |date=|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to [[thalidomide]] deformities to achieve a greater shock effect.<ref name=\"rubin\" /> After many heated arguments,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist [[H. R. Giger]] and the photographers [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Joel-Peter Witkin]] for inspiration; another influence came from the [[Brothers Quay]]'s 1986 [[stop motion]] short film ''[[Street of Crocodiles]]''.\n\n{{quote box|quote=Vietnam was really a means to an end. It was a plot device rather than something we were trying to make a huge issue of.|source=\u2013[[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]]<ref name=nyt/>|width=30%}}\n\nIn the film, Jacob is told by Michael that the horrific events he experienced on his final day in Vietnam were the product of an experimental drug called \"the Ladder\", which was used on troops without their knowledge. At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, [[NATO]] code for a [[deliriant]] and [[hallucinogen]] known as [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|3-quinuclidinyl benzilate]], on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]]. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was [[Martin A. Lee]]'s book ''[[Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and Sixties Rebellion]]'', but noted that \"nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ \u2014 a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit [[Mania|maniac behavior]] \u2014 was used on U.S. troops.\"<ref name=\"st\" />\n\nAccording to Lyne's audio commentary, [[test screening]]s indicated that the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience.

Ideologically, he identified as a [[national conservative]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in [[Magdeburg]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] province of [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]], Seldte was the son of an owner of a factory producing chemical products and soda water.<ref>Stackelberg (2007). ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref> He attended the Wilhelm-Raabe-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Magdeburg and, after an apprenticeship as a salesman, studied chemistry at the universities of [[Braunschweig University of Technology|Braunschweig]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]].

According to Seldte, the organization was to use the spirit of the ''Frontsoldaten'' against the \u2018swinish revolution\u2019 taking place in Germany under the Weimar government.<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref> While he took charge of ''Der Stahlhelm'' from 1923 onwards, he had to cope with the constant rivalry of his deputy leader, the militant [[Theodor Duesterberg]].\n\nSeldte became a member of the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) and was a member of the Magdeburg city council (''Stadtrat'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\nDuring the later years of the [[Weimar Republic]] ''Der Stahlhelm'' became increasingly anti-democratic and anti-republican. However, Seldte hoped that the organization could become a leading organ of a united right-wing movement. In 1929 it united its forces with the DNVP under [[Alfred Hugenberg]], the [[Pan-German League]] and the [[Nazi Party]] to initiate a [[1929 German referendum|German referendum]] against the [[Young Plan]] on [[World War I reparations]].<ref>Kershaw (2000). ''Hitler: 1889-1936, Hubris'', p. 310, 356.</ref>  The common goal was to denounce the Chancellor [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] and his ministers as traitors to their country, nevertheless the plebiscite failed to reach the [[quorum]]. In 1931 Seldte helped create the short-lived [[Harzburg Front]],<ref>Zentner & Bed\u00fcrftig, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', vol. 2, (M-Z), p. 869.</ref> a right-wing alliance against the government of M\u00fcller's successor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]].\n\n==Minister for Labour==\nDuring the negotiations for the Chancellorship of Germany between [[Franz von Papen]] and Hitler in mid-January 1933, Seldte threw his vote and ''Der Stahlhelm'' behind Hitler, after which, Papen acquiesced to Hitler\u2019s demands.<ref>Longerich (2012). ''Heinrich Himmler'', p. 144.</ref> On the day of the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' on 30 January 1933, Seldte joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour,<ref>Shirer (1990).

In the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|elections of March 1933]] ''Der Stahlhelm'' together with Hugenberg's national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) attempted to make the ''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'' (\"[[National colours of Germany|Black White Red]] Combat Front\") into the dominant political camp on the right, but ultimately failed as it only gained 8.0% of the votes cast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nevertheless, Seldte obtained a seat in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' parliament as a DNVP \"guest\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nOn 27 April 1933 Seldte finally joined the Nazi Party and merged ''Der Stahlhelm'' into [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]'s ''[[Sturmabteilung]] (SA)'' militia \u2013 de facto placing it at the disposal of Hitler.<ref>Bracher (1970). ''The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism'', p. 222.</ref> In August 1933, he was awarded the rank of ''SA-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' and later was appointed [[Reichskommissar]] for the ''Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst'' employment program, but was soon superseded by his state secretary [[Konstantin Hierl]] as leader of the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In March 1934 Seldte was made the federal leader of the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk\u00e4mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm)'' ({{lang-en|National Socialist German Combatants' Federation (Stahlhelm)}}) (NSDFBSt), a successor organization of ''Der Stahlhelm'', which however was soon disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1935 he requested to be released from official responsibilities, but Hitler refused.\n\nThroughout his tenure as chief of the Labor Ministry, Seldte never enjoyed the full support of Hitler, who did not think he was worth much. As a result, members of the Nazi hierarchy began encroaching on his areas of responsibility and Seldte was marginalized accordingly.<ref>Fischer (1995). ''Nazi Germany: A New History'', p. 315.</ref> For instance, Hermann Goering\u2019s Four Year Plan which he began to implement in late 1936, ran roughshod over Seldte's Labor Ministry altogether.<ref>Evans (2006). ''The Third Reich in Power'', p. 358.</ref> Seldte, without substantial power, remained Reich Minister for Labour until the end of [[World War II]] and was also a member of the [[Free State of Prussia (1933\u20131947)|Prussian]] government under Minister president [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as State Labour Minister. Even after Hitler\u2019s suicide and the nomination of Grand-Admiral D\u00f6nitz as his successor, Seldte kept his post, being accordingly named Labour Minister.<ref>Mazower (2009).

''Dictionary of the Third Reich'', p. 261.</ref> His story was not convincing. Seldte died in a US military hospital in April 1947 at [[F\u00fcrth]], before the Nuremberg Tribunal had the chance to formally arraign him on charges.<ref>Snyder (1976).

''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref> Prior to his ministry, Seldte served as the Federal Leader of ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' [[World War I]] ex-[[Serviceman|servicemen]]'s organisation from 1918 to 1934. Ideologically, he identified as a [[national conservative]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in [[Magdeburg]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] province of [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]], Seldte was the son of an owner of a factory producing chemical products and soda water.<ref>Stackelberg (2007). ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref> He attended the Wilhelm-Raabe-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Magdeburg and, after an apprenticeship as a salesman, studied chemistry at the universities of [[Braunschweig University of Technology|Braunschweig]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. In 1908 he took over the business of his early deceased father.<ref>Wistrich (2001). ''Who's Who In Nazi Germany'', p. 232.</ref> As an officer of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] he was wounded in [[World War I]] and lost his left arm.<ref>Stackelberg (2007). ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 243.</ref>  He then became a front reporter. Awarded with the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd and 1st class,<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref> Seldte also was promoted to the rank of ''[[Hauptmann|Hauptmann d.R.]]'' in the 66th Infantry Regiment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==''Der Stahlhelm''==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-01258, Hugenberg, von Stephani und Seldte.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Seldte (r.) with Hugenberg and the Berlin Stahlhelm leader von Stephani at a rally against the Young-Plan, [[Berlin Sportpalast]], 1929]]\nAs a reaction to the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], Seldte founded ''Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten'' on 25 December 1918, agitating against the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and German [[World War I reparations|war reparations]]. According to Seldte, the organization was to use the spirit of the ''Frontsoldaten'' against the \u2018swinish revolution\u2019 taking place in Germany under the Weimar government.<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref> While he took charge of ''Der Stahlhelm'' from 1923 onwards, he had to cope with the constant rivalry of his deputy leader, the militant [[Theodor Duesterberg]].\n\nSeldte became a member of the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) and was a member of the Magdeburg city council (''Stadtrat'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\nDuring the later years of the [[Weimar Republic]] ''Der Stahlhelm'' became increasingly anti-democratic and anti-republican. However, Seldte hoped that the organization could become a leading organ of a united right-wing movement. In 1929 it united its forces with the DNVP under [[Alfred Hugenberg]], the [[Pan-German League]] and the [[Nazi Party]] to initiate a [[1929 German referendum|German referendum]] against the [[Young Plan]] on [[World War I reparations]].<ref>Kershaw (2000). ''Hitler: 1889-1936, Hubris'', p. 310, 356.</ref>  The common goal was to denounce the Chancellor [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] and his ministers as traitors to their country, nevertheless the plebiscite failed to reach the [[quorum]]. In 1931 Seldte helped create the short-lived [[Harzburg Front]],<ref>Zentner & Bed\u00fcrftig, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', vol. 2, (M-Z), p. 869.</ref> a right-wing alliance against the government of M\u00fcller's successor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]].\n\n==Minister for Labour==\nDuring the negotiations for the Chancellorship of Germany between [[Franz von Papen]] and Hitler in mid-January 1933, Seldte threw his vote and ''Der Stahlhelm'' behind Hitler, after which, Papen acquiesced to Hitler\u2019s demands.<ref>Longerich (2012). ''Heinrich Himmler'', p. 144.</ref> On the day of the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' on 30 January 1933, Seldte joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour,<ref>Shirer (1990). ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 184.</ref> once again outdoing his long-time rival Duesterberg. In the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|elections of March 1933]] ''Der Stahlhelm'' together with Hugenberg's national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) attempted to make the ''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'' (\"[[National colours of Germany|Black White Red]] Combat Front\") into the dominant political camp on the right, but ultimately failed as it only gained 8.0% of the votes cast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nevertheless, Seldte obtained a seat in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' parliament as a DNVP \"guest\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nOn 27 April 1933 Seldte finally joined the Nazi Party and merged ''Der Stahlhelm'' into [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]'s ''[[Sturmabteilung]] (SA)'' militia \u2013 de facto placing it at the disposal of Hitler.<ref>Bracher (1970). ''The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism'', p. 222.</ref> In August 1933, he was awarded the rank of ''SA-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' and later was appointed [[Reichskommissar]] for the ''Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst'' employment program, but was soon superseded by his state secretary [[Konstantin Hierl]] as leader of the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In March 1934 Seldte was made the federal leader of the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk\u00e4mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm)'' ({{lang-en|National Socialist German Combatants' Federation (Stahlhelm)}}) (NSDFBSt), a successor organization of ''Der Stahlhelm'', which however was soon disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1935 he requested to be released from official responsibilities, but Hitler refused.\n\nThroughout his tenure as chief of the Labor Ministry, Seldte never enjoyed the full support of Hitler, who did not think he was worth much. As a result, members of the Nazi hierarchy began encroaching on his areas of responsibility and Seldte was marginalized accordingly.<ref>Fischer (1995). ''Nazi Germany: A New History'', p. 315.</ref> For instance, Hermann Goering\u2019s Four Year Plan which he began to implement in late 1936, ran roughshod over Seldte's Labor Ministry altogether.<ref>Evans (2006). ''The Third Reich in Power'', p. 358.</ref> Seldte, without substantial power, remained Reich Minister for Labour until the end of [[World War II]] and was also a member of the [[Free State of Prussia (1933\u20131947)|Prussian]] government under Minister president [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as State Labour Minister. Even after Hitler\u2019s suicide and the nomination of Grand-Admiral D\u00f6nitz as his successor, Seldte kept his post, being accordingly named Labour Minister.<ref>Mazower (2009). ''Hitler\u2019s Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'', pp. 532\u2013533.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nSeldte was captured and arrested in [[Mondorf-les-Bains]] at the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} During the Nuremberg trials, Seldte tried to exonerate himself by claiming that he had stood against the dictatorship of Hitler and that he advocated for a two-chamber system of parliamentary governance.<ref>Taylor & Shaw (2002). ''Dictionary of the Third Reich'', p. 261.</ref> His story was not convincing. Seldte died in a US military hospital in April 1947 at [[F\u00fcrth]], before the Nuremberg Tribunal had the chance to formally arraign him on charges.<ref>Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 320.</ref>\n\nDuring the time of [[Nazi Germany]], streets were named after him in several German cities, among them his hometown Magdeburg and [[Leverkusen]].<ref>[http://www.leverkusen.com/strasse/index.php4?view=Seldte Franz-Seldte-Str.
