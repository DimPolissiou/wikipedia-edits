Mike meets with Nacho, who suspects that Mike is responsible for the heist, which Mike admits. He explains his intent to attract police attention to Hector's drug operation, but Nacho tells him that a passing motorist freed Ximenez. Ximenez then called Hector, who dispatched a crew to clean up traces of the attack, including killing the good Samaritan and burying him in the desert.\n\nAt a meeting of the New Mexico Banking Board, the panel members realize that the documents they're reviewing while considering approval of a new Mesa Verde branch are incorrect. Between corrections and waiting for the next scheduled meeting of the board, the bank will experience a six-week delay. Chuck is humiliated and immediately suspects that Jimmy was involved. Kevin decides to leave HHM and sign with Kim, who promises Mesa Verde will be her sole client and the focus of her attention. Jimmy and Kim arrive at Chuck's house to pick up the Mesa Verde files and Chuck accuses Jimmy of sabotaging his case. Kim sides with Jimmy and claims Chuck simply made a mistake, arguing that Chuck has no proof and that Chuck's belittling treatment of Jimmy has prevented him from becoming as successful as Chuck. Alone in the car with Jimmy, Kim reveals her awareness of his trick by angrily punching him.\n\nJimmy and his camera crew visit a local elementary school, wait for recess to end, then start to shoot video of Jimmy standing in front of the waving American flag for use in his TV ads. They're interrupted by the principal and another staff member, but Jimmy falsely claims he's filming a documentary on [[Rupert Holmes]], who's supposedly a famous former student at the school. The skeptical principal leaves to call the school superintendent's office, giving Jimmy and his crew time to finish.\n\nLater that night, Kim tells Jimmy she never wants to discuss how the incorrect documents came to be filed, but suggests Chuck is a formidable adversary and if Jimmy left any evidence behind, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes he can be caught if the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents says he was there, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence. He arrives while Ernesto is questioning the clerk; Chuck had him checking at each all night copy store in the city to see if anyone recognized Jimmy. Receiving a positive answer, Ernesto leaves to get Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk. Jimmy enters and pays off the clerk, afterwards hiding across the street to watch Chuck arrive. Ernesto and Chuck enter the store and Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] symptoms overcome him and he faints, hitting his head on the counter as he falls. Jimmy is torn between his desire to aid Chuck and his reluctance to come out of hiding, because doing so would be an admission that he had been at the store previously to alter the documents.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.06 million American viewers, and an 18\u201349 rating of 0.8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-cable-ratings-april-11-2016/|title=Monday cable ratings: \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 and \u2018Teen Mom\u2019 hold steady|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Welch|first=Alex|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe episode received critical acclaim from critics.

Lange used up most of his fortune with alchemy experiments, so their marriage was delayed some years while he avoided his creditors and traveled to Germany to try to find patrons for his work.

They lived in this town for a while in extreme poverty. Sophie wrote a long letter to her sister Margrethe Brahe, describing having to wear stockings with holes in them for her wedding. Lange's wedding clothes had to be returned to the pawn shop after the wedding, because the couple could not afford to keep them. She expressed anger with her family for not accepting her science studies, and for depriving her of money owed to her. By 1608, Erik Lange was living in [[Prague]], and he died there in 1613 (Det Kongelige Bibliotek).\n\nSophia was often ridiculed and avoided due to her personal life and marriage. Many alienated her due to her marriage to Erik Lange which was opposed by all in her family except for her brother Tycho. <ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\" />\n\nSophie Brahe personally financed the restoration of the local church, [[Ivetofta|Ivetofta kyrka]]. She planned to be buried there, and the lid for her unused sarcophagus remains in the church's armory (Svensson, et al.). But, by 1616 she had moved permanently to [[Zealand]] and settled in [[Helsing\u00f8r]]. In [[Zealand]], she lived specifically in Elsinore where she worked primarily on horticulture and healing plants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copenhagen |last2=Gothenburg |title=Sophia Ottesdatter Brahe |url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/brahe-sophie-ottesdatter/ |website=The History of Nordic Women's Literature |publisher=KvindeLitteraturHistorie P\u00c5 Nettet, 2012. |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref> She spent her last years writing up the genealogy of Danish noble families, publishing the first major version in 1626 (there were later additions).

That church housed a burial chapel for the Thott family that remained for some time even after the church itself was pulled down in the mid-19th century (the new Torrl\u00f6sa church was built nearby). Currently, a stone setting marks the outlines of the Thott chapel, while the tombstone for Sophie Brahe is still standing on the site.\n\n== Career and Research ==\nTycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy. Instead, Sophia learned astronomy on her own, studying books in German, and having Latin books translated with her own money so that she could read them as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asmu.dk/pub/Download/nyhedsbrev/1.aar/sophie303.pdf|title=Hvem er Sophie|last=Tjornum|first=Gilbert|date=November 11, 2003|website=Astrologisk Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=57}}: 8 December 1573 ... helped Tycho to observe a lunar eclipse</ref> Later in both of their careers, Tycho began to discourage her from continuing her research into astronomy because he believed it to be too complex for the talents of a woman.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSophia frequently visited [[Uraniborg|Uranienborg]], Tycho's observatory on the then-Danish island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hveen]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

Specifically, she assisted with a set of observations on 11 November 1572, which led to the discovery of the supernova that is now called [[SN 1572]], as well as observations of the 8 December 1573 lunar eclipse. The discovery of SN 1572 was especially significant in that it added to the growing body of evidence that seemed to refute the geocentric model of the universe.

During this time, she also became a horticulturalist, in addition to her studies in chemistry and medicine.

Lange used up most of his fortune with alchemy experiments, so their marriage was delayed some years while he avoided his creditors and traveled to Germany to try to find patrons for his work.

They lived in this town for a while in extreme poverty. Sophie wrote a long letter to her sister Margrethe Brahe, describing having to wear stockings with holes in them for her wedding. Lange's wedding clothes had to be returned to the pawn shop after the wedding, because the couple could not afford to keep them. She expressed anger with her family for not accepting her science studies, and for depriving her of money owed to her. By 1608, Erik Lange was living in [[Prague]], and he died there in 1613 (Det Kongelige Bibliotek).\n\nSophia was often ridiculed and avoided due to her personal life and marriage. Many alienated her due to her marriage to Erik Lange which was opposed by all in her family except for her brother Tycho. <ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\" />\n\nSophie Brahe personally financed the restoration of the local church, [[Ivetofta|Ivetofta kyrka]]. She planned to be buried there, and the lid for her unused sarcophagus remains in the church's armory (Svensson, et al.). But, by 1616 she had moved permanently to [[Zealand]] and settled in [[Helsing\u00f8r]].

That church housed a burial chapel for the Thott family that remained for some time even after the church itself was pulled down in the mid-19th century (the new Torrl\u00f6sa church was built nearby). Currently, a stone setting marks the outlines of the Thott chapel, while the tombstone for Sophie Brahe is still standing on the site.\n\n== Career and Research ==\nTycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy.
