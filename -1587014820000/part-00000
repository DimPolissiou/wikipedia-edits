Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

'''jaguarundi''' (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'') ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) is a wild [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2013red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Home range]]s tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges {{convert|1.4|\u2013|18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size for females, while those of males measured {{convert|8.5|\u2013|25.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area.<ref name=Hunter/> Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of {{convert|88|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi}}, while the home range of a female in the same region measured {{convert|13|\u2013|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.<ref name=Nowak/> Population densities are typically low, around {{convert|0.01|to|0.05|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}, though the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as {{convert|0.2|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bellani/>\n\nMarking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered. Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas.

Online social platforms are very common among teenagers. Teenagers tend to stay active on social media to acquire a very attractive and appealing online profile. As young users get criticized, they become the subjects of shaming experiences and tend to develop depressive disorders.

In general, a criminal sentenced to one of the many forms of this punishment could expect to be placed in a central, public, or open place so that his fellow citizens could easily witness the sentence and, occasionally, participate in it as a form of \"[[mob justice]]\".\n\nJust like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a [[rite of passage]]. Physical forms include being forced to wear some sign such as \"donkey ears\" (simulated in paper, as a sign one is\u2014or at least behaved\u2014proverbially stupid), wearing a [[dunce cap]], having to stand, kneel or bend over in a corner, or repeatedly write something on a blackboard (\"I will not spread rumors\", for example). Here different levels of physical discomfort can be added, such as having to hold heavy objects, go [[barefoot]] (see below) or kneeling on an uneven surface. Like physical punishment and harsh hazing, these have become controversial in most modern societies, in many cases leading to legal restrictions and/or (sometimes voluntary) abolishment.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-041-10, Paris, der Kollaboration beschuldigte Franz\u00f6sinnen.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photograph of two women with shaved heads and blank expressions on their face walking down a street in Paris.

In general, a criminal sentenced to one of the many forms of this punishment could expect to be placed in a central, public, or open place so that his fellow citizens could easily witness the sentence and, occasionally, participate in it as a form of \"[[mob justice]]\".\n\nJust like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a [[rite of passage]]. Physical forms include being forced to wear some sign such as \"donkey ears\" (simulated in paper, as a sign one is\u2014or at least behaved\u2014proverbially stupid), wearing a [[dunce cap]], having to stand, kneel or bend over in a corner, or repeatedly write something on a blackboard (\"I will not spread rumors\", for example). Here different levels of physical discomfort can be added, such as having to hold heavy objects, go [[barefoot]] (see below) or kneeling on an uneven surface. Like physical punishment and harsh hazing, these have become controversial in most modern societies, in many cases leading to legal restrictions and/or (sometimes voluntary) abolishment.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-041-10, Paris, der Kollaboration beschuldigte Franz\u00f6sinnen.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photograph of two women with shaved heads and blank expressions on their face walking down a street in Paris.

At the same time, the [[Russian Empire]] expanded into previously Ottoman-ruled or Ottoman-allied regions of the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Black Sea]] region. Muslims in these countries suffered, with many dying during the conflicts or becoming refugees. The persecution of Muslims was continued during [[World War I]] by the invading Russian troops in the east and during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the west, east, and south of [[Anatolia]]. After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], a [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] took place, and most [[Greek Muslims]] left.

Some of the settlers were [[Y\u00f6r\u00fcks]], nomads who quickly became sedentary, and others were from urban classes. They settled in almost all of the towns, but the majority of them settled in the Eastern Balkans. The main areas of settlement were [[Ludogorie]], [[Dobrudzha]], the Thracian plain, the mountains and plains of northern [[Greece]] and Eastern Macedonia around the [[Vardar]] river.\n\nBetween the 15th and 17th centuries, large numbers of native Balkan peoples converted to [[Islam]].

During this era, the Austrian Empire outlined its position to the Bosnian Muslim population about living within its administration. Two options were offered by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] such as a [[conversion to Christianity]] while retaining property and remaining on Austrian territory, or for a departure of those remaining Muslim to other lands.<ref>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\". ''Journal of Islamic Studies''. '''5'''. (2): 245\u2013246. \"This being the case, the Muslim Bosnians could no longer imagine any existence for Muslims outside the ''devlet'' unless they lived outside the pale of the ''din'', it cannot be denied that the attitude of neighbouring countries had influenced this state of mind. For after two centuries of stability and supremacy ''d\u0101r ar-Isl\u0101m'' was no longer immune from attack. Muslims now faced a new, unexpected, inconceivable situation. The triumph of their Christian enemies meant that, in order to survive, the Muslims had to choose either to Christianize and remain inside the Christian state or to emigrate southwards in order to remain Muslims within the Muslim state. Thus we notice that Austria in particular, when changing from the defensive to the offensive, was concentrating on Bosnia, but without its Muslims. in the war of 1737\u20139 we find Emperor Charles VI, in the edict addressed to the Muslim Bosnians dated June 1737, outlining two options for them: 'whoever of them wishes to adopt Christianity, may be free to stay and retain his property, while those who do not may emigrate to wherever they want' They fared no better in the 1788\u201391 war, although Emperor Joseph I issued a proclamation in which he promised to respect Muslim rights and institutions. However, despite these pledges, the Muslims quickly disappeared from the areas ceded by the Ottoman Empire.\"</ref>\n\n=== Montenegro ===\nAt the beginning of the 18th century (1709 or 1711) Orthodox [[Serbs]] massacred their Muslim neighbors in [[Montenegro]].<ref name=\"Black2007\">{{cite book|last=Black|first=Jeremy|authorlink=Jeremy Black (historian)|title=European Warfare in a Global Context, 1660\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvZ9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|date=12 February 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-15922-2|page=192|quote=The Muslim population of Montenegro was massacred by the Serbs.}}</ref><ref name=\"Kir\u00e1lyRothenberg1982\">{{cite book|last1=Kir\u00e1ly|first1=B\u00e9la K.|authorlink1=B\u00e9la K.

Cambridge University Press. p. 28-29. \" As the characteristically high urbanization of Ottoman Europe reflected institutional structure rather than economic complexity, the dissolution of Ottoman institutions by the successor states could cause rapid deurbanization. This process occurred in its most striking form in Serbia. In the eighteenth century, Ottoman Serbia was highly urbanized, but during the wars and the revolutionary upheaval of 1789\u20141815, the Serbian towns experienced a precipitous decline. In 1777, there were reportedly some 6,000 houses in Belgrade,\" from which a population of 30,000 \u2014 55,000 may be estimated. By about 1800, the town had shrunk to around 3,000 houses with 25,000 inhabitants, and in 1834 the number of houses had fallen further to 769. Late-eighteenth-century U\u017eice had 2,900 Muslim houses; this indicates a population of around 20,000, for when the last 3,834 Muslims were driven from the town in 1862, they vacated 550 houses. Tihomir Dordevi\u0107 put the population of U\u017eice in the late eighteenth century still higher, at 12,000 houses with about 60,000 inhabitants. By 1860, when U\u017eice's population was 4,100, but still overwhelmingly Muslim, the effects of the town's decline were all too visible, the bazaars 'rotting and ruinous', and 'whole streets which stood here before the Servian revolution... turned into orchards'. In 1863, after the expulsions, there remained in the town a population of some 2,490. Valjevo in the 1770s was also a substantial place with 3,000 Muslim and 200 Christian houses. At least 5 other towns had 200 \u2014 500 houses each. Given the low population density of Ottoman Serbia, a remarkably high proportion of its inhabitants were town dwellers. Belgrade ''pa\u0161aluk'' in the late eighteenth century had 376,000 Serbian and 40,000 \u2014 50,000 Turkish inhabitants. On this basis, the two largest towns alone would have accounted for 11\u201427 per cent of the population of the ''pa\u0161aluk''. The urban proportion could have been higher still, for a number of smaller towns dwindled into villages on the departure of the Ottomans.</ref><ref name=gran>{{cite book|last=Grandits|first=Hannes|title=Conflicting Loyalties in the Balkans: The Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire and Nation-Building|year=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848854772|page=208}}</ref> \nSome Muslim families then migrated and resettled in Bosnia, where their descendants today reside in urban centres such as [[\u0160amac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|\u0160amac]], [[Tuzla]], [[Fo\u010da]] and [[Sarajevo]].<ref>Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107, Adil (1998).

In this war the Ottomans were defeated and in the process a large part of the [[Turks of Bulgaria]] fled to [[Anatolia]] and [[Constantinople]]. It was a cold winter and a large part of them died.

(4) : 460\u2013461. \"In consequence of the Russian-Ottoman war, a violent expulsion of nearly the entire Muslim, predominantly Albanian-speaking, population was carried out in the sanjak of Ni\u0161 and Toplica during the winter of 1877\u20141878 by the Serbian troops. This was one major factor encouraging further violence, but also contributing greatly to the formation of the League of Prizren. The league was created in an opposing reaction to the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin and is generally regarded as the beginning of the Albanian national movement. The displaced persons (Alb. ''muhaxhir\u00eb'', Turk. ''muhacir'', Serb. ''muhad\u017eir'') took refuge predominantly in the eastern parts of Kosovo. The Austro-Hungarian consul Jelinek reported in April 1878.... The account shows that these displaced persons (''muhaxhir\u00eb'') were highly hostile to the local Slav population. But also the Albanian peasant population did not welcome the refugees, since they constituted a factor of economic rivalry. As a consequence of these expulsions, the interreligious and interethnic relations worsened. Violent acts of Muslims against Christians, in the first place against Orthodox but also against Catholics, accelerated. This can he explained by the fears of the Muslim population in Kosovo that were stimulated by expulsions of large Muslim population groups in other parts of the Balkans in consequence of the wars in the nineteenth century in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated and new Balkan states were founded. The latter pursued a policy of ethnic homogenisation expelling large Muslim population groups.\"</ref><ref>Stefanovi\u0107. ''Seeing the Albanians''. 2005. p. 470. \"The 'cleansing' of Toplica and Kosanica would have long-term negative effects on Serbian-Albanian relations. The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there. Janji\u0107ije Popovi\u0107, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876\u20138 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo. In 1900 \u017divojin Peri\u0107, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion. The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians. From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks. Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state.\"</ref>\n\n===Bosnia===\nIn 1875 a conflict between Muslims and Christians broke out in Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} After the Ottoman Empire signed the treaty at the 1878 Berlin Congress, Bosnia was occupied by Austria-Hungary.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) perceived this as a betrayal by the Ottomans and left on their own, felt that they were defending their homeland and not the wider Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> From 9 July until 20 October 1878 or for almost three months, Bosnian Muslims resisted Austro-Hungarian forces in nearly 60 military engagements with 5000 casualties either wounded or killed.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Some Bosnian Muslims concerned about their future and well being under the new non-Muslim administration, left Bosnia for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\". ''Journal of Islamic Studies''. '''5'''. (2): 246\u2013247. \"As for Bosnia, the treaty signed at the congress of Berlin in 1878 stunned the Muslims of that country who did not believe that the Ottoman Empire would forsake them so easily, and did not docilely resign themselves to the new Austro-Hungarian rule. They set up a government for their own defence and fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian forces for about three months (29 July-20 October 1878), a period which witnessed nearly sixty military clashes and resulted in 5000 casualties either killed or wounded.\" It may be noted that this stiff resistance was carried out almost exclusively by the Muslims, who were in this instance defending the homeland or ''vatan'' (Bosnia) and not the ''devlet'' (the Ottoman Empire) which forsook them. The Ottoman government had indeed seen in this resistance an opportunity to improve its own position and scored several points in its favour at the Istanbul Convention of 21 April 1879. For example, it was emphasized that the fact of occupation constituted no infringement of the' sovereign rights of the sultan over Bosnia, that the Muslims had the right to maintain their ties with Istanbul, that the name of the sultan could be mentioned in the Friday prayer sermon and on similar occasions, and that the Ottoman flag could be raised on the mosques.\" But this new situation created such a nightmare that some elderly men preferred to confine themselves to their homes rather than see 'infidels' in the streets. The Muslims, who had not yet recovered from the 1878 shock, were taken aback by the new military service law of 1881 which applied to Muslim youths also. This increased dissatisfaction with the new situation and speeded up hijra to the Ottoman Empire.\"</ref> From 1878 until 1918, between 130,000<ref name=Kaser2011>{{cite book|last=Kaser|first=Karl|title=The Balkans and the Near East: Introduction to a Shared History|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=9783643501905|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j3i8muwLf8AC&pg=PA336&dq=bosnia+1878++occupation+130000#v=onepage&q=bosnia%201878%20%20occupation%20130000&f=false}}</ref> and 150,000 Bosnian Muslims departed Bosnia to areas under Ottoman control, some to the [[Balkans]], others to [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Maghreb]].<ref>al-Arnaut.

The official statistics of the Austro-Hungarian administration admit that 61,000 Muslims emigrated, while Bogi\u010devi\u0107 gives 150,000, Smlati\u0107 gives 160,000, and Imamovi\u0107's estimate ranges between 150.000 and 180,000. Newspaper estimates rise to 300,000 and popular accounts put a figure as high as 700,000. Official statistics no doubt reduced the number of emigrants to make them equal the number of settlers who stayed in Bosnia (63,376). If we look at Ottoman data, we will find a wide gap between them and the Austro-Hungarian data. The Istanbul High Commissioners Office for Facilitating Refugee Settlement told Hiviz Bjelevac, the Bosnian writer, that during 1900\u201305 alone 73,000 Muslims left Bosnia, while Austro-Hungarian statistics give the much smaller number of 13,150. From all that has been said above, a figure like 150,000 will probably be more realistic.

McCarthy demonstrates that not all of the ethnic cleansing and ethnic killing in the Ottoman Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries followed the model often posited in the West, whereby all the victims were Christian and all the perpetrators were Muslim. McCarthy has shown that there were mass killings of Muslims and deportations of millions of Muslims from the Balkans and the Caucasus over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. McCarthy, who is labeled (correctly in this author's estimation) as being pro- Turkish by some writers and is a denier of the Armenian genocide, has estimated that about 5.5 million Muslims were killed in the hundred years from 1821\u20131922. Several million more refugees poured out of the Balkans and Russian conquered areas, forming a large refugee (muhajir) community in Istanbul and Anatolia.\"</ref>\n\nHistorian Mark Biondich estimates that from 1878-1912 up to two million Muslims left the Balkans either voluntarily or involuntarily while Muslims casualties in the Balkans during 1912-1923 within the context of those killed and expelled exceeded some three million.<ref name=\"Biondich93\">{{cite book|last=Biondich|first=Mark|title=The Balkans: Revolution, War, and Political Violence Since 1878|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199299058|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gt8SDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA93&dq=Muslims+casualties+millions+Balkans#v=onepage&q=Muslims%20casualties%20millions%20Balkans&f=false|pages=93|ref=harv}} \"In the period between 1878 and 1912, as many as two million Muslims emigrated voluntarily or involuntarily from the Balkans.

At the same time, the [[Russian Empire]] expanded into previously Ottoman-ruled or Ottoman-allied regions of the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Black Sea]] region. Muslims in these countries suffered, with many dying during the conflicts or becoming refugees. The persecution of Muslims was continued during [[World War I]] by the invading Russian troops in the east and during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the west, east, and south of [[Anatolia]]. After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], a [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] took place, and most [[Greek Muslims]] left.

Some of the settlers were [[Y\u00f6r\u00fcks]], nomads who quickly became sedentary, and others were from urban classes. They settled in almost all of the towns, but the majority of them settled in the Eastern Balkans. The main areas of settlement were [[Ludogorie]], [[Dobrudzha]], the Thracian plain, the mountains and plains of northern [[Greece]] and Eastern Macedonia around the [[Vardar]] river.\n\nBetween the 15th and 17th centuries, large numbers of native Balkan peoples converted to [[Islam]].

During this era, the Austrian Empire outlined its position to the Bosnian Muslim population about living within its administration. Two options were offered by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] such as a [[conversion to Christianity]] while retaining property and remaining on Austrian territory, or for a departure of those remaining Muslim to other lands.<ref>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\".

(2): 245\u2013246. \"This being the case, the Muslim Bosnians could no longer imagine any existence for Muslims outside the ''devlet'' unless they lived outside the pale of the ''din'', it cannot be denied that the attitude of neighbouring countries had influenced this state of mind. For after two centuries of stability and supremacy ''d\u0101r ar-Isl\u0101m'' was no longer immune from attack. Muslims now faced a new, unexpected, inconceivable situation. The triumph of their Christian enemies meant that, in order to survive, the Muslims had to choose either to Christianize and remain inside the Christian state or to emigrate southwards in order to remain Muslims within the Muslim state. Thus we notice that Austria in particular, when changing from the defensive to the offensive, was concentrating on Bosnia, but without its Muslims. in the war of 1737\u20139 we find Emperor Charles VI, in the edict addressed to the Muslim Bosnians dated June 1737, outlining two options for them: 'whoever of them wishes to adopt Christianity, may be free to stay and retain his property, while those who do not may emigrate to wherever they want' They fared no better in the 1788\u201391 war, although Emperor Joseph I issued a proclamation in which he promised to respect Muslim rights and institutions.

Cambridge University Press. p. 28-29. \" As the characteristically high urbanization of Ottoman Europe reflected institutional structure rather than economic complexity, the dissolution of Ottoman institutions by the successor states could cause rapid deurbanization. This process occurred in its most striking form in Serbia. In the eighteenth century, Ottoman Serbia was highly urbanized, but during the wars and the revolutionary upheaval of 1789\u20141815, the Serbian towns experienced a precipitous decline. In 1777, there were reportedly some 6,000 houses in Belgrade,\" from which a population of 30,000 \u2014 55,000 may be estimated. By about 1800, the town had shrunk to around 3,000 houses with 25,000 inhabitants, and in 1834 the number of houses had fallen further to 769. Late-eighteenth-century U\u017eice had 2,900 Muslim houses; this indicates a population of around 20,000, for when the last 3,834 Muslims were driven from the town in 1862, they vacated 550 houses. Tihomir Dordevi\u0107 put the population of U\u017eice in the late eighteenth century still higher, at 12,000 houses with about 60,000 inhabitants. By 1860, when U\u017eice's population was 4,100, but still overwhelmingly Muslim, the effects of the town's decline were all too visible, the bazaars 'rotting and ruinous', and 'whole streets which stood here before the Servian revolution... turned into orchards'. In 1863, after the expulsions, there remained in the town a population of some 2,490. Valjevo in the 1770s was also a substantial place with 3,000 Muslim and 200 Christian houses. At least 5 other towns had 200 \u2014 500 houses each. Given the low population density of Ottoman Serbia, a remarkably high proportion of its inhabitants were town dwellers. Belgrade ''pa\u0161aluk'' in the late eighteenth century had 376,000 Serbian and 40,000 \u2014 50,000 Turkish inhabitants. On this basis, the two largest towns alone would have accounted for 11\u201427 per cent of the population of the ''pa\u0161aluk''. The urban proportion could have been higher still, for a number of smaller towns dwindled into villages on the departure of the Ottomans.</ref><ref name=gran>{{cite book|last=Grandits|first=Hannes|title=Conflicting Loyalties in the Balkans: The Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire and Nation-Building|year=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848854772|page=208}}</ref> \nSome Muslim families then migrated and resettled in Bosnia, where their descendants today reside in urban centres such as [[\u0160amac, Bosnia and Herzegovina|\u0160amac]], [[Tuzla]], [[Fo\u010da]] and [[Sarajevo]].<ref>Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107, Adil (1998).

(4) : 460\u2013461. \"In consequence of the Russian-Ottoman war, a violent expulsion of nearly the entire Muslim, predominantly Albanian-speaking, population was carried out in the sanjak of Ni\u0161 and Toplica during the winter of 1877\u20141878 by the Serbian troops. This was one major factor encouraging further violence, but also contributing greatly to the formation of the League of Prizren. The league was created in an opposing reaction to the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin and is generally regarded as the beginning of the Albanian national movement. The displaced persons (Alb. ''muhaxhir\u00eb'', Turk. ''muhacir'', Serb. ''muhad\u017eir'') took refuge predominantly in the eastern parts of Kosovo. The Austro-Hungarian consul Jelinek reported in April 1878.... The account shows that these displaced persons (''muhaxhir\u00eb'') were highly hostile to the local Slav population. But also the Albanian peasant population did not welcome the refugees, since they constituted a factor of economic rivalry. As a consequence of these expulsions, the interreligious and interethnic relations worsened. Violent acts of Muslims against Christians, in the first place against Orthodox but also against Catholics, accelerated. This can he explained by the fears of the Muslim population in Kosovo that were stimulated by expulsions of large Muslim population groups in other parts of the Balkans in consequence of the wars in the nineteenth century in which the Ottoman Empire was defeated and new Balkan states were founded. The latter pursued a policy of ethnic homogenisation expelling large Muslim population groups.\"</ref><ref>Stefanovi\u0107. ''Seeing the Albanians''. 2005. p. 470. \"The 'cleansing' of Toplica and Kosanica would have long-term negative effects on Serbian-Albanian relations. The Albanians expelled from these regions moved over the new border to Kosovo, where the Ottoman authorities forced the Serb population out of the border region and settled the refugees there. Janji\u0107ije Popovi\u0107, a Kosovo Serb community leader in the period prior to the Balkan Wars, noted that after the 1876\u20138 wars, the hatred of the Turks and Albanians towards the Serbs 'tripled'. A number of Albanian refugees from Toplica region, radicalized by their experience, engaged in retaliatory violence against the Serbian minority in Kosovo. In 1900 \u017divojin Peri\u0107, a Belgrade Professor of Law, noted that in retrospect, 'this unbearable situation probably would not have occurred had the Serbian government allowed Albanians to stay in Serbia'. He also argued that conciliatory treatment towards Albanians in Serbia could have helped the Serbian government to gain the sympathies of Albanians of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, while both humanitarian concerns and Serbian political interests would have dictated conciliation and moderation, the Serbian government, motivated by exclusive nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiments, chose expulsion. The 1878 cleansing was a turning point because it was the first gross and large-scale injustice committed by Serbian forces against the Albanians. From that point onward, both ethnic groups had recent experiences of massive victimization that could be used to justify 'revenge' attacks. Furthermore, Muslim Albanians had every reason to resist the incorporation into the Serbian state.\"</ref>\n\n===Bosnia===\nIn 1875 a conflict between Muslims and Christians broke out in Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} After the Ottoman Empire signed the treaty at the 1878 Berlin Congress, Bosnia was occupied by Austria-Hungary.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) perceived this as a betrayal by the Ottomans and left on their own, felt that they were defending their homeland and not the wider Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> From 9 July until 20 October 1878 or for almost three months, Bosnian Muslims resisted Austro-Hungarian forces in nearly 60 military engagements with 5000 casualties either wounded or killed.<ref name=al-Arnaut /> Some Bosnian Muslims concerned about their future and well being under the new non-Muslim administration, left Bosnia for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=al-Arnaut>al-Arnaut, Muhamed Mufaku (1994). \"Islam and Muslims in Bosnia 1878\u20131918: Two Hijras and Two Fatw\u0101s\".

(2): 246\u2013247. \"As for Bosnia, the treaty signed at the congress of Berlin in 1878 stunned the Muslims of that country who did not believe that the Ottoman Empire would forsake them so easily, and did not docilely resign themselves to the new Austro-Hungarian rule. They set up a government for their own defence and fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian forces for about three months (29 July-20 October 1878), a period which witnessed nearly sixty military clashes and resulted in 5000 casualties either killed or wounded.\" It may be noted that this stiff resistance was carried out almost exclusively by the Muslims, who were in this instance defending the homeland or ''vatan'' (Bosnia) and not the ''devlet'' (the Ottoman Empire) which forsook them. The Ottoman government had indeed seen in this resistance an opportunity to improve its own position and scored several points in its favour at the Istanbul Convention of 21 April 1879. For example, it was emphasized that the fact of occupation constituted no infringement of the' sovereign rights of the sultan over Bosnia, that the Muslims had the right to maintain their ties with Istanbul, that the name of the sultan could be mentioned in the Friday prayer sermon and on similar occasions, and that the Ottoman flag could be raised on the mosques.\" But this new situation created such a nightmare that some elderly men preferred to confine themselves to their homes rather than see 'infidels' in the streets. The Muslims, who had not yet recovered from the 1878 shock, were taken aback by the new military service law of 1881 which applied to Muslim youths also. This increased dissatisfaction with the new situation and speeded up hijra to the Ottoman Empire.\"</ref> From 1878 until 1918, between 130,000<ref name=Kaser2011>{{cite book|last=Kaser|first=Karl|title=The Balkans and the Near East: Introduction to a Shared History|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=9783643501905|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j3i8muwLf8AC&pg=PA336&dq=bosnia+1878++occupation+130000#v=onepage&q=bosnia%201878%20%20occupation%20130000&f=false}}</ref> and 150,000 Bosnian Muslims departed Bosnia to areas under Ottoman control, some to the [[Balkans]], others to [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Maghreb]].<ref>al-Arnaut.

The official statistics of the Austro-Hungarian administration admit that 61,000 Muslims emigrated, while Bogi\u010devi\u0107 gives 150,000, Smlati\u0107 gives 160,000, and Imamovi\u0107's estimate ranges between 150.000 and 180,000. Newspaper estimates rise to 300,000 and popular accounts put a figure as high as 700,000. Official statistics no doubt reduced the number of emigrants to make them equal the number of settlers who stayed in Bosnia (63,376). If we look at Ottoman data, we will find a wide gap between them and the Austro-Hungarian data. The Istanbul High Commissioners Office for Facilitating Refugee Settlement told Hiviz Bjelevac, the Bosnian writer, that during 1900\u201305 alone 73,000 Muslims left Bosnia, while Austro-Hungarian statistics give the much smaller number of 13,150. From all that has been said above, a figure like 150,000 will probably be more realistic.

McCarthy demonstrates that not all of the ethnic cleansing and ethnic killing in the Ottoman Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries followed the model often posited in the West, whereby all the victims were Christian and all the perpetrators were Muslim. McCarthy has shown that there were mass killings of Muslims and deportations of millions of Muslims from the Balkans and the Caucasus over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. McCarthy, who is labeled (correctly in this author's estimation) as being pro- Turkish by some writers and is a denier of the Armenian genocide, has estimated that about 5.5 million Muslims were killed in the hundred years from 1821\u20131922.

NASA said it will begin negotiations with Axiom on a firm-fixed-price contract to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port on space station's Harmony module, or Node 2. Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment which would consists of five modules. These modules would include a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\".

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation]] of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/ |title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting |publisher=NASASPaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Mission controls==\nThe components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at [[Mission Control Center|mission control centres]] across the globe, including:\n* Roscosmos's [[Mission Control Center#RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], Moscow Oblast, controls the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control for the entire Station,<ref name=\"Navigation\" /><ref name=\"EsaComputer\" /> in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* ESA's [[ATV Control Centre]], at the [[Toulouse Space Centre]] (CST) in [[Toulouse]], France, controls flights of the uncrewed European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* JAXA's JEM Control Center and HTV Control Center at [[Tsukuba Space Center]] (TKSC) are responsible for operating the ''Kib\u014d'' complex and all flights of the White Stork HTV Cargo spacecraft, respectively.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* NASA's [[Christopher C.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

NASA said it will begin negotiations with Axiom on a firm-fixed-price contract to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port on space station's Harmony module, or Node 2. Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment which would consists of five modules. These modules would include a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\".

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation]] of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/ |title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting |publisher=NASASPaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Mission controls==\nThe components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at [[Mission Control Center|mission control centres]] across the globe, including:\n* Roscosmos's [[Mission Control Center#RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], Moscow Oblast, controls the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control for the entire Station,<ref name=\"Navigation\" /><ref name=\"EsaComputer\" /> in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* ESA's [[ATV Control Centre]], at the [[Toulouse Space Centre]] (CST) in [[Toulouse]], France, controls flights of the uncrewed European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* JAXA's JEM Control Center and HTV Control Center at [[Tsukuba Space Center]] (TKSC) are responsible for operating the ''Kib\u014d'' complex and all flights of the White Stork HTV Cargo spacecraft, respectively.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* NASA's [[Christopher C.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.
