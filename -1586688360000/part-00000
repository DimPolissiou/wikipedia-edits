The album topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and to date holds the record for the longest climb to number one for an album. The project spawned a number of successful singles, and is one of only nine albums to have four singles top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It went on to earn a seven-times platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nAbdul released the ''[[Shut Up and Dance: Mixes]]'' (1990) remix album to a positive commercial reaction, earning a platinum certification from the RIAA. She continued to find success with the release of ''[[Spellbound (Paula Abdul album)|Spellbound]]'' (1991), her second studio album. It debuted at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200, climbing to the top soon after it was released. The album's first two singles both topped the Hot 100 chart with the first, \"[[Rush Rush]]\" becoming first number-one single in six years to spend more than four weeks on top. The third single reached the top ten. Despite the album's achievements, it failed to match the success of its predecessor. Following a musical hiatus while dealing with personal issues, Abdul returned with the release of ''[[Head over Heels (Paula Abdul album)|Head over Heels]]'' (1995), her third and final studio effort. The album and coinciding singles were deemed commercial failures, and were met with a mixed reaction from critics. Following the release of the album, Abdul entered a second musical hiatus.\n\nFollowing multiple attempts at resuming her career, Abdul released the single \"[[Dance Like There's No Tomorrow]]\" (2008) with [[Randy Jackson]]. She later released \"[[I'm Just Here for the Music]]\" (2009) the following year, though neither single gained momentum on the charts. Since the start of her career, Abdul has sold over fifty-three million record worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity/281584/paula-abdul-s-stalker-found-dead.html|title=Paula Abdul's 'stalker' found dead|work=[[Marie Claire]]|at=marieclaire.co.uk|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=2013-02-06|quote=Abdul has sold more than 53 million records.}}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details, chart positions, sales, and certifications\n!

The album topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and to date holds the record for the longest climb to number one for an album. The project spawned a number of successful singles, and is one of only nine albums to have four singles top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It went on to earn a seven-times platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nAbdul released the ''[[Shut Up and Dance: Mixes]]'' (1990) remix album to a positive commercial reaction, earning a platinum certification from the RIAA. She continued to find success with the release of ''[[Spellbound (Paula Abdul album)|Spellbound]]'' (1991), her second studio album. It debuted at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200, climbing to the top soon after it was released. The album's first two singles both topped the Hot 100 chart with the first, \"[[Rush Rush]]\" becoming first number-one single in six years to spend more than four weeks on top. The third single reached the top ten. Despite the album's achievements, it failed to match the success of its predecessor. Following a musical hiatus while dealing with personal issues, Abdul returned with the release of ''[[Head over Heels (Paula Abdul album)|Head over Heels]]'' (1995), her third and final studio effort. The album and coinciding singles were deemed commercial failures, and were met with a mixed reaction from critics. Following the release of the album, Abdul entered a second musical hiatus. \n\nFollowing multiple attempts at resuming her career, Abdul released the single \"[[Dance Like There's No Tomorrow]]\" (2008) with [[Randy Jackson]]. She later released \"[[I'm Just Here for the Music]]\" (2009) the following year, though neither single gained momentum on the charts. Since the start of her career, Abdul has sold over fifty-three million record worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity/281584/paula-abdul-s-stalker-found-dead.html|title=Paula Abdul's 'stalker' found dead|work=[[Marie Claire]]|at=marieclaire.co.uk|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=2013-02-06|quote=Abdul has sold more than 53 million records.}}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details, chart positions, sales, and certifications\n!

These provisions changed the remedies for the circumvention of copy-prevention systems (also called \"technical protection measures\") and required that all analog video recorders have support for a specific form of copy prevention created by Macrovision (now [[Rovi Corporation]]) built in, giving Macrovision an effective monopoly on the analog video-recording copy-prevention market. The section contains a number of specific limitations and exemptions, for such things as government research and [[reverse engineering]] in specified situations. Although, section 1201(c) of the title stated that the section does not change the underlying substantive copyright infringement rights, remedies, or defenses, it did not make those defenses available in circumvention actions. The section does not include a [[fair use]] exemption from criminality nor a [[scienter]] requirement, so criminal liability could attach to even unintended circumvention for legitimate purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Band, Jonathan |author2=Katoh, Masanobu|year=2011|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|location=|publisher=MIT Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFMUBhojiA0C&pg=PA92 92]|isbn=978-0-262-01500-4}}</ref>\n\n===Title II: Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act===\nDMCA Title II, the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]] (\"OCILLA\"), creates a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for [[online service provider]]s (OSPs, including [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements.<ref>Cullins, Ashley [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/music-industry-a-listers-call-879718 Music Industry A-Listers Call on Congress to Reform Copyright Act] ''Hollywood Reporter''.

OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of [[subpoena]]s against OSPs to provide their users' identity.\n\n===Title III: Computer Maintenance Competition Assurance Act===\nDMCA Title III modified [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/117.html section 117] of the copyright title so that those repairing computers could make certain temporary, limited copies while working on a computer. It reversed the precedent set in ''[[MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.]]'', 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n===Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions===\nDMCA Title IV contains an assortment of provisions:\n* Clarified and added to the duties of the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]].\n* Added ephemeral copy for broadcasters provisions, including certain [[statutory license]]s.\n* Added provisions to facilitate [[distance education]].\n* Added provisions to assist libraries with keeping phonorecords of sound recordings.\n* Added provisions relating to collective bargaining and the transfer of movie rights.\n\n===Title V: Vessel Hull Design Protection Act===\n'''DMCA''' Title V added sections [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1301.html 1301] through [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1332.html 1332] to add a ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for boat hull designs. Boat hull designs were not considered covered under copyright law because boats are useful articles whose form cannot be separated from their function.<ref>17 U.S.C. 101 (defining \"Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works\" as \"Such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\")</ref><ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/hr2696.html \"Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1997 (H.R. 2696)\"], Statement of MaryBeth Peters, The Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, Oct. 23, 1997 (\"It is a long-held view of the Office that a gap exists in legal protection for the designs of useful articles. Existing bodies of federal intellectual property law do not provide appropriate and practical coverage for such designs, while state law is largely preempted in this area. Consequently, while considerable investment and creativity may go into the creation of innovative designs, they often can be copied with impunity.\").</ref>\n\n==Anti-circumvention exemptions==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2013}}\nIn addition to the safe harbors and exemptions the statute explicitly provides, [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)] requires that the [[Librarian of Congress]] issue exemptions from the prohibition against circumvention of access-control technology. Exemptions are granted when it is shown that access-control technology has had a substantial adverse effect on the ability of people to make non-infringing uses of copyrighted works.\n\nThe exemption rules are revised every three years. Exemption proposals are submitted by the public to the Registrar of Copyrights, and after a process of hearings and public comments, the final rule is recommended by the Registrar and issued by the Librarian. Exemptions expire after three years and must be resubmitted for the next rulemaking cycle. Consequently, only the most recent rulemaking is valid, and prior exemptions issued (in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2013) are no longer valid. As of 2017 (for the 2018 rulemaking), the Copyright Office is considering re-authorizing such exemptions if no new evidence is submitted to the contrary.\n\n=== Section 1201 Study ===\nAfter much criticism (see [[#Criticisms|below]]), on December 29, 2015, the Copyright Office initiated a study to assess the operation of section 1201 and the triennial rulemaking process. This is different from usual public comments on exemption proposals. It includes the role of the anti-trafficking provisions and permanent exemptions, and the requirements of the rulemaking itself. The Office has issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting public comment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/policy/1201/ |title=Section 1201 Study |work=U.S. Copyright Office |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral comments were posted by individuals and organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=84&so=ASC&sb=docId&po=0&dct=PS&D=COLC-2015-0012&refD=COLC-2015-0012-0088 |title=Docket Browser: Request for Public Comments: Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Access to Copyrighted Works}}</ref>\nAn individual recalls that the [[Copyright Clause]] has limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2015-0012-0014 |title=Initial Comments - David Oster |author=David Oster |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n[[Association of American Publishers]] ''et al.'' hold there is no need to amend the statute or to significantly alter the rulemaking.

First, fair use has been a legal gray area, and subject to opposing interpretations. This has caused inequity in the treatment of individual cases. Second, the DMCA has often been invoked overbearingly, favoring larger copyright holders over smaller ones. This has caused accidental takedowns of legitimate content, such as a record company accidentally removing a music video from their own artist. Third, the lack of consequences for perjury in claims encourages censorship. This has caused temporary takedowns of legitimate content that can be financially damaging to the legitimate copyright holder, who has no recourse for reimbursement. This has been used by businesses to censor competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cobia|first=Jeffrey|year=2008|title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act Takedown Notice Procedure: Misuses, Abuses, and Shortcomings of the Process|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mipr10&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=391|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law Science & Technology|volume=1|pages=391\u2013393|via=Hein Online}}</ref>\n\n===Abuse of the anti-circumvention provision===\n\nIn 2015 [[Volkswagen]] abused the DMCA to hide their vehicles [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|emissions cheat]].<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/researchers-could-have-uncovered-volkswagens-emissions-cheat-if-not-hindered-dmca Researchers Could Have Uncovered Volkswagen's Emissions Cheat If Not Hindered by the DMCA | Electronic Frontier Foundation]</ref> It has been suggested that had the DMCA not prevented access to the software \"..a researcher with legal access to Volkswagen's software could have discovered the code that changed how the cars behave in testing..\"<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/epa-opposes-rules-couldve-exposed-vws-cheating/ Wired]</ref>\n\n=== Effect on analog video equipment ===\n\n[[Analog Copy Protection]] (ACP), the encryption technology created by [[Rovi Corporation]] (formerly Macrovision, now TiVo), is designed to thwart users' attempts to reproduce content via analog cables. When a DVD is played through an analog video cable and recorded using a [[VCR]], Rovi's ACP technology will distort the copy partially or completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|title=ACP|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327214055/http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|archive-date=2010-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe technology works by adding additional lines to the video signal. In the [[NTSC]] video standard, blank lines ([[vertical blanking interval]]s) that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213677,00.html|title=Vertical blanking interval}}</ref>\n\nThe implementation of ACP has been ill-regarded by some video enthusiasts. Many claim that the technology has led to signal issues with VCRs and analog video equipment. Some VCRs misread the encryption used to prevent copying, distorting the video image regardless of whether the recording is original or a copy.\n\nThe DMCA has been criticized for forcing all producers of analog video equipment to support the proprietary copy protection technology of Rovi Corporation, a commercial firm. The producers of video equipment are forced by law to support and implement the corporation's proprietary technology. This benefits Rovi Corporation financially, whereas those forced to implement it receive neither profit nor compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|title=Analog Off|website=Publicknowledge.org|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627184546/http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|archive-date=2010-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Another DMCA Misuse: Macrovision v.

A recently developed TV-streaming product called the [[Slingbox]] uses analog signals to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes. On one or more accounts, students have not been able to cite and record cable sources properly due to ACP restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/analog-hole|title=Analog Hole|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2013-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on research===\n{{Main|Digital rights management}}\n\nThe DMCA has affected the worldwide [[cryptography]] research community, since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA.

It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as [[digital rights management]] or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the [[Internet]].<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf DMCA p7.]</ref><ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title17/html/USCODE-2010-title17-chap5-sec506.htm United States Code (2010) Title 17 CHAPTER 5, COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES, Sec. 506 \u2013 Criminal offenses]</ref> Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the [[United States Senate]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended [[Title 17 of the United States Code|Title 17]] of the [[United States Code]] to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the [[Online service provider|providers of online services]] for [[copyright infringement]] by their users.\n\nThe DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and [[indirect liability]] of [[Internet service provider]]s and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the [[European Union]] in the [[Electronic Commerce Directive]] 2000. The [[Information Society Directive]] 2001 implemented the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] in the EU.\n\n==Provisions==\n\n===Title I: WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act===\nDMCA Title I, the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]], amends U.S. copyright law to comply with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]] and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], adopted at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference in December 1996. The treaties have two major portions. One portion includes works covered by several treaties in U.S. copy prevention laws and gave the title its name. For further analysis of this portion of the Act and of cases under it, see [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]].\n\nThe second portion (17 U.S.C. 1201) is often known as the DMCA [[anti-circumvention]] provisions. These provisions changed the remedies for the circumvention of copy-prevention systems (also called \"technical protection measures\") and required that all analog video recorders have support for a specific form of copy prevention created by Macrovision (now [[Rovi Corporation]]) built in, giving Macrovision an effective monopoly on the analog video-recording copy-prevention market. The section contains a number of specific limitations and exemptions, for such things as government research and [[reverse engineering]] in specified situations. Although, section 1201(c) of the title stated that the section does not change the underlying substantive copyright infringement rights, remedies, or defenses, it did not make those defenses available in circumvention actions. The section does not include a [[fair use]] exemption from criminality nor a [[scienter]] requirement, so criminal liability could attach to even unintended circumvention for legitimate purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Band, Jonathan |author2=Katoh, Masanobu|year=2011|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|location=|publisher=MIT Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFMUBhojiA0C&pg=PA92 92]|isbn=978-0-262-01500-4}}</ref>\n\n===Title II: Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act===\nDMCA Title II, the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]] (\"OCILLA\"), creates a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for [[online service provider]]s (OSPs, including [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements.<ref>Cullins, Ashley [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/music-industry-a-listers-call-879718 Music Industry A-Listers Call on Congress to Reform Copyright Act] ''Hollywood Reporter''. April 5, 2016</ref> OSPs must adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to alleged infringing material (or remove such material from their systems) when they receive [[DMCA takedown notice|notification of an infringement claim]] from a copyright holder or the copyright holder's agent. OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of [[subpoena]]s against OSPs to provide their users' identity.\n\n===Title III: Computer Maintenance Competition Assurance Act===\nDMCA Title III modified [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/117.html section 117] of the copyright title so that those repairing computers could make certain temporary, limited copies while working on a computer. It reversed the precedent set in ''[[MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.]]'', 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n===Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions===\nDMCA Title IV contains an assortment of provisions:\n* Clarified and added to the duties of the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]].\n* Added ephemeral copy for broadcasters provisions, including certain [[statutory license]]s.\n* Added provisions to facilitate [[distance education]].\n* Added provisions to assist libraries with keeping phonorecords of sound recordings.\n* Added provisions relating to collective bargaining and the transfer of movie rights.\n\n===Title V: Vessel Hull Design Protection Act===\n'''DMCA''' Title V added sections [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1301.html 1301] through [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1332.html 1332] to add a ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for boat hull designs. Boat hull designs were not considered covered under copyright law because boats are useful articles whose form cannot be separated from their function.<ref>17 U.S.C. 101 (defining \"Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works\" as \"Such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\")</ref><ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/hr2696.html \"Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1997 (H.R. 2696)\"], Statement of MaryBeth Peters, The Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, Oct. 23, 1997 (\"It is a long-held view of the Office that a gap exists in legal protection for the designs of useful articles. Existing bodies of federal intellectual property law do not provide appropriate and practical coverage for such designs, while state law is largely preempted in this area. Consequently, while considerable investment and creativity may go into the creation of innovative designs, they often can be copied with impunity.\").</ref>\n\n==Anti-circumvention exemptions==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2013}}\nIn addition to the safe harbors and exemptions the statute explicitly provides, [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)] requires that the [[Librarian of Congress]] issue exemptions from the prohibition against circumvention of access-control technology. Exemptions are granted when it is shown that access-control technology has had a substantial adverse effect on the ability of people to make non-infringing uses of copyrighted works.\n\nThe exemption rules are revised every three years. Exemption proposals are submitted by the public to the Registrar of Copyrights, and after a process of hearings and public comments, the final rule is recommended by the Registrar and issued by the Librarian. Exemptions expire after three years and must be resubmitted for the next rulemaking cycle. Consequently, only the most recent rulemaking is valid, and prior exemptions issued (in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2013) are no longer valid. As of 2017 (for the 2018 rulemaking), the Copyright Office is considering re-authorizing such exemptions if no new evidence is submitted to the contrary.\n\n=== Section 1201 Study ===\nAfter much criticism (see [[#Criticisms|below]]), on December 29, 2015, the Copyright Office initiated a study to assess the operation of section 1201 and the triennial rulemaking process. This is different from usual public comments on exemption proposals. It includes the role of the anti-trafficking provisions and permanent exemptions, and the requirements of the rulemaking itself. The Office has issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting public comment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/policy/1201/ |title=Section 1201 Study |work=U.S. Copyright Office |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral comments were posted by individuals and organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=84&so=ASC&sb=docId&po=0&dct=PS&D=COLC-2015-0012&refD=COLC-2015-0012-0088 |title=Docket Browser: Request for Public Comments: Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Access to Copyrighted Works}}</ref>\nAn individual recalls that the [[Copyright Clause]] has limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2015-0012-0014 |title=Initial Comments - David Oster |author=David Oster |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n[[Association of American Publishers]] ''et al.'' hold there is no need to amend the statute or to significantly alter the rulemaking. They are happy with the protection they are being granted, including anti-trafficking provisions, and talk of placing the cart before the horse, when they argue about requiring a proof of the mindset that consumers would have when utilizing circumvention tools\nbefore actual acts of circumvention occur. In their opinion, the meaning of Section 1201 is to ''extend'', not merely duplicate, copyright holder's rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=COLC-2015-0012-0077&amp;attachmentNumber=1&amp;contentType=pdf |title=Reply Comments of: Association of American Publishers, Motion Picture Association of America, Recording Industry Association of America |date=April 1, 2016 |author1=Allan R.

First, fair use has been a legal gray area, and subject to opposing interpretations. This has caused inequity in the treatment of individual cases. Second, the DMCA has often been invoked overbearingly, favoring larger copyright holders over smaller ones. This has caused accidental takedowns of legitimate content, such as a record company accidentally removing a music video from their own artist. Third, the lack of consequences for perjury in claims encourages censorship. This has caused temporary takedowns of legitimate content that can be financially damaging to the legitimate copyright holder, who has no recourse for reimbursement. This has been used by businesses to censor competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cobia|first=Jeffrey|year=2008|title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act Takedown Notice Procedure: Misuses, Abuses, and Shortcomings of the Process|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mipr10&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=391|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law Science & Technology|volume=1|pages=391\u2013393|via=Hein Online}}</ref>\n\n===Abuse of the anti-circumvention provision===\n\nIn 2015 [[Volkswagen]] abused the DMCA to hide their vehicles [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|emissions cheat]].<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/researchers-could-have-uncovered-volkswagens-emissions-cheat-if-not-hindered-dmca Researchers Could Have Uncovered Volkswagen's Emissions Cheat If Not Hindered by the DMCA | Electronic Frontier Foundation]</ref> It has been suggested that had the DMCA not prevented access to the software \"..a researcher with legal access to Volkswagen's software could have discovered the code that changed how the cars behave in testing..\"<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/epa-opposes-rules-couldve-exposed-vws-cheating/ Wired]</ref>\n\n=== Effect on analog video equipment ===\n\n[[Analog Copy Protection]] (ACP), the encryption technology created by [[Rovi Corporation]] (formerly Macrovision, now TiVo), is designed to thwart users' attempts to reproduce content via analog cables. When a DVD is played through an analog video cable and recorded using a [[VCR]], Rovi's ACP technology will distort the copy partially or completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|title=ACP|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327214055/http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|archive-date=2010-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe technology works by adding additional lines to the video signal. In the [[NTSC]] video standard, blank lines ([[vertical blanking interval]]s) that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213677,00.html|title=Vertical blanking interval}}</ref>\n\nThe implementation of ACP has been ill-regarded by some video enthusiasts. Many claim that the technology has led to signal issues with VCRs and analog video equipment. Some VCRs misread the encryption used to prevent copying, distorting the video image regardless of whether the recording is original or a copy.\n\nThe DMCA has been criticized for forcing all producers of analog video equipment to support the proprietary copy protection technology of Rovi Corporation, a commercial firm. The producers of video equipment are forced by law to support and implement the corporation's proprietary technology. This benefits Rovi Corporation financially, whereas those forced to implement it receive neither profit nor compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|title=Analog Off|website=Publicknowledge.org|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627184546/http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|archive-date=2010-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Another DMCA Misuse: Macrovision v. Sima|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2006/08/another-dmca-misuse-macrovision-v-sima|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, some criticize the implementation of ACP as a violation of their [[fair use]] rights. A recently developed TV-streaming product called the [[Slingbox]] uses analog signals to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes. On one or more accounts, students have not been able to cite and record cable sources properly due to ACP restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/analog-hole|title=Analog Hole|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2013-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on research===\n{{Main|Digital rights management}}\n\nThe DMCA has affected the worldwide [[cryptography]] research community, since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybercrime.gov/Sklyarovindictment.htm |title=First Indictment Under Digital Millennium Copyright Act Returned Against Russian National |publisher=Cybercrime.gov |accessdate=2011-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017035005/http://www.cybercrime.gov/Sklyarovindictment.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2011 }}</ref> While working for [[ElcomSoft]] in Russia, he developed ''The Advanced eBook Processor'', a software application allowing users to strip usage restriction information from restricted [[e-book]]s, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200108/elcomsoftqa.html|title=Adobe FAQ: ElcomSoft legal background|publisher=Adobe.com|accessdate=2011-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104031758/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200108/elcomsoftqa.html|archive-date=2011-11-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States to provide such a tool.

[[The Unlocking Technology Act of 2013]] was introduced to attempt to exempt non-infringing uses from the anti-circumvention clause.<ref name=\"Couts\">{{Cite news|author=Couts, Andrew|date=9 May 2013|title=Awesome new bill legalizes cell phone unlocking, 'fixes' the DMCA|newspaper=Digital Trends Newsletter|publisher=Designtechnica Corporation|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/new-bill-legalizes-cell-phone-unlocking-fixes-the-dmca/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703073505/http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/new-bill-legalizes-cell-phone-unlocking-fixes-the-dmca/|archivedate=3 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the bill was not passed by Congress. In 2014, the [[Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act]] was passed, granting a specific exemption for unlocking cell phones, without affecting the other provisions of the DMCA.\n\nBills in 2015 included the Unlocking Technology Act of 2015,<ref>[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1587/text Govtrack.us]</ref> and the Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation Act of 2015.<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/990 Congress.gov]</ref> Republicans are considering legislation as well, as it becomes clear that Section 1201 is impeding the country's security. Facing escalating numbers of cyberthreats, cybersecurity researchers petitioned to conduct research to keep pace with evolving cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, stating: \"Without such an exemption, security risks will lie unaddressed and the public will be substantially less safe.\"<ref>[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=lawfac_reports Engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu]</ref> The bills are intended to address the fact that section 1201 prevents circumvention even when doing so is not copyright infringement. In addition, the section requires exemption proponents to bear the burden of proof every time their exemption comes up for triennial review, instead of there being a presumption of renewal for an exemption whose importance was previously proven.\n\n[[Rick Boucher]], a congressman from Virginia, led previous efforts by introducing the [[Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act]] (DMCRA).\n\nA prominent bill related to the DMCA is the [[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]] (CBDTPA), known in early drafts as the Security Systems and Standards Certification Act (SSSCA). This bill, if it had passed, would have dealt with the devices used to access digital content and would have been even more restrictive than the DMCA.{{vague|date=February 2015}}\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the DMCA, and several times afterwards, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] documented harmful consequences of the anti-circumvention provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca |title=Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years under the DMCA &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> They document that the DMCA:\n\n# Stifles free expression, such as in its use against Russian programmer [[Dmitry Sklyarov]], Princeton Professor [[Edward Felten]], and journalists;\n# Jeopardizes [[fair use]];\n# Impedes competition, such as blocking aftermarket competition in toner cartridges, garage door openers, and enforcing [[walled garden (technology)|walled gardens]] around the [[iPod]];<ref>[[OdioWorks v.

Prior to December 1990, radio stations were simply asked what songs were on their playlists and what songs have recently been added. [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|Nielsen BDS]] was introduced in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in January 1990 and first used on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Country music chart]]. It was adopted for the Hot 100 Airplay on the issue dated December 8, 1990, and on the Hot 100 with the issued dated November 30, 1991.<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 27, 2004 |title=Top 10 Billboard Chart Milestones |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=116 |issue=48 |pages=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBMEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Bronson |first=Fred |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> BDS measures actual airplay by monitoring radios stations continuously with computers that \"listen for the unique 'audio fingerprint' of each song and register a detection every time a song is played.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite journal |date=September 19, 1998 |title=How the Chart Got Its Start |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=38 |pages=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwoEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Bronson |first=Fred |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> One of the first noticeable effects of the change in methodology was that there tended to be less turnover of the top songs. Before the switch, only one song had spent at least ten weeks at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart; from the period of December 1990 until the end of the decade, 16 songs had a minimum ten-week run at the top of the chart. While the BDS technology may have had some impact as to why this was happening, the cause has also been attributed to the trends of the radio industry at the time with stations playing the same songs over longer periods of time.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a new trend began to emerge: singles without being released commercially in an attempt to boost album sales.

Prior to December 1990, radio stations were simply asked what songs were on their playlists and what songs have recently been added. [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|Nielsen BDS]] was introduced in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in January 1990 and first used on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Country music chart]]. It was adopted for the Hot 100 Airplay on the issue dated December 8, 1990, and on the Hot 100 with the issued dated November 30, 1991.<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 27, 2004 |title=Top 10 Billboard Chart Milestones |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=116 |issue=48 |pages=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBMEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Bronson |first=Fred |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> BDS measures actual airplay by monitoring radios stations continuously with computers that \"listen for the unique 'audio fingerprint' of each song and register a detection every time a song is played.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite journal |date=September 19, 1998 |title=How the Chart Got Its Start |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=38 |pages=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwoEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Bronson |first=Fred |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> One of the first noticeable effects of the change in methodology was that there tended to be less turnover of the top songs. Before the switch, only one song had spent at least ten weeks at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart; from the period of December 1990 until the end of the decade, 16 songs had a minimum ten-week run at the top of the chart. While the BDS technology may have had some impact as to why this was happening, the cause has also been attributed to the trends of the radio industry at the time with stations playing the same songs over longer periods of time.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a new trend began to emerge: singles without being released commercially in an attempt to boost album sales. While not a new concept, it started becoming commonplace.<ref name=\"Mayfield\">{{cite journal |date=September 19, 1998 |title=Chart Changes Pondered |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=38 |pages=1, 165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwoEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Geoff |last=Mayfield |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> With the June 17, 1995, issue, \"[[I'll Be There for You (The Rembrandts song)|I'll Be There for You]]\", became the first single to top the Hot 100 Airplay chart without appearing on the Hot 100.<ref name=\"McKenna\">{{cite journal |date=June 17, 1995 |title=Hot 100 Singles Spotlight |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=107 |issue=24 |pages=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=McKenna |first=Jerry |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> (It would later peak at No. 17 on the Hot 100 when released as a B-side to [[the Rembrandts]] follow-up single, \"This House Is Not a Home\", combined with its continued but fading dominance on the radio.) More songs followed with tracks such as \"[[Don't Speak]]\", \"[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]\", \"[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]\", \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\", and \"[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]\", each becoming the most played song on American pop radio, despite being ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 itself due to a lack of a commercially available single. While this practice didn't end, in the ''Billboard'' issue dated December 5, 1998, policy was revised to allow \"airplay-only\" songs to chart on the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 5, 1998

[[Scott Hall]] [[taser]] match, where one must strike the opponent with the taser, regardless of who retrieved the taser first).\n\nLadder matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually \"containing\" a contract for a future championship match) or championship belts hung above the ring.  Ladder matches and their variants (such as [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC matches]] and [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|Full Metal Mayhem]]) are often used in feuds that involve a dispute over possession of an item (such as a stolen title belt or the \"paperwork\" for the contractual services of a manager).  Ladder matches are almost always fought under [[hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] rules.\n\n==Origins==\nThe ladder match could have been invented by either [[Dan Kroffat]] of the [[Stampede Wrestling]] organization out of [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta, Canada]] or British wrestler [[Peter Thornley|Kendo Nagasaki]]. In September 1972, Stampede Wrestling held the first ever ladder match between Dan Kroffat and [[Tor Kamata]], where the object to be grabbed was a wad of money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/history/ladder.html|title=History of the Ladder match|accessdate=|publisher=OnlineWorldofWrestling.com}}</ref> In 1987, Kendo Nagasaki competed in a \"disco challenge\" ladder match against Clive Myers on the popular ''[[World of Sport (UK TV series)|World of Sport]]''. The aim of this match was to retrieve a gold coloured disco record suspended above the ring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/icfyt/it-came-from-youtube-witness-the-disco-ladder-match/ |title=It Came From YouTube: Witness The Disco Ladder Match! - WrestleCrap - The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling! |publisher=WrestleCrap |date= |accessdate=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1983, Stampede Wrestling held a ladder match in which [[Bret Hart]] faced off against [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]]. Hart went on to join the [[World Wrestling Federation]] in 1984, and, in the early 1990s, suggested this type of match to promoter [[Vince McMahon]], years before the gimmick achieved its eventual popularity.\n\nThe first ever ladder match in the WWF, in which Hart defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Intercontinental Title, was held in Portland, ME on July 21, 1992. The match was taped but never aired on television, and remained widely unseen until its inclusion on the 2007 ''The Ladder Match'' DVD and among the bonus material on the 2011 DVD and Blu-ray collection ''WWE's Greatest Rivalries: Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart''. The two performers tell interviewer [[Jim Ross]] how the match was planned along with an intended ladder rematch that never materialized.\n\n== Ladder matches in World Wrestling

The next two nights did not feature Benjamin as he was too injured to participate.\n*Similar to a Stairway to Hell match, during Triple H and Kevin Nash's ladder match, a sledgehammer was hung above the ring. The first participant to retrieve it could use it as a weapon. The only way to have won was by pinfall or submission.\n\n;Participant list\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Wrestler\n!Victories\n!Appearances\n|-\n|[[Jeff Hardy]]\n|7 \n|12 \n|-\n|[[Rob Van Dam]]\n|5\n|6\n|-\n|[[Matt Hardy]]\n|4\n|7\n|-\n|[[Chris Jericho]]\n|3\n|3\n|-\n|[[Triple H]]\n|3\n|3\n|-\n|[[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]\n|3\n|6\n|-\n|[[Dolph Ziggler]]\n|3\n|6\n|-\n|[[Christian Cage|Christian]]\n|3\n|8\n|-\n|[[Kurt Angle]]\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|[[Seth Rollins]]\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|[[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]]\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|[[Kofi Kingston]]\n|2\n|3\n|-\n|[[Shawn Michaels]]\n|2\n|6\n|-\n|[[Bret Hart]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Mr. McMahon]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[The Undertaker]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Yoshihiro Tajiri|Tajiri]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Rey Mysterio]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Paul London]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Brian Kendrick]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Adrian Neville]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Daniel Bryan]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Zack Ryder]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[James Ellsworth (wrestler)|James Ellsworth]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Akam (wrestler)|Akam]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Rezar (wrestler)|Rezar]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Adam Cole]]\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|[[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]]\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|[[Razor Ramon]]\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|[[John Cena]]\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|[[Finn B\u00e1lor]]\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|[[Shane McMahon]]\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|[[Eddie Guerrero]]\n|1\n|3\n|-\n|[[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro/John Morrison]]\n|1\n|3\n|-\n|[[The Miz]]\n|1\n|3\n|-\n|[[Kevin Owens]]\n|1\n|3\n|-\n|[[Goldust]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Bubba Ray Dudley]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[D-Von Dudley]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Mike Haywood\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Big Show]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[William Regal]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Dave Taylor (wrestler)|Dave Taylor]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Joey Mercury]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Jack Swagger]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Kevin Nash]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Bo Dallas]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Randy Orton]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Bray Wyatt]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Roman Reigns]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Bad News Barrett]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[R-Truth]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Jey Uso]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Jimmy Uso]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Sami Zayn]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[AJ Styles]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Luke Gallows]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Karl Anderson]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Enzo Amore]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Big Cass]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Johnny Gargano]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Tommaso Ciampa]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Ethan Carter III|EC3]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Ricochet (wrestler)|Ricochet]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Velveteen Dream]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Killian Dain]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Lars Sullivan]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Samoa Joe]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Bobby Lashley]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Dash Wilder]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]]\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|[[Mick Foley|Mankind]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Chris Benoit]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Charlie Haas]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Alberto Del Rio]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Luke Harper]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Dean Ambrose]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Cody Rhodes|Stardust]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Sin Cara]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]]\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|[[Shelton Benjamin]]\n|0\n|3\n|-\n|[[Sheamus]]\n|0\n|3\n|}\n\n== Ladder matches in World Championship Wrestling ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:1%;\"|#\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:20%;\"|Match\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:20%;\"|Stipulations\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:10%;\"|Event\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:10%;\"|Date\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:10%;\"|Location\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:7%;\"|Time\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:3%;\"|Ref\n|-\n|1\n|[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] (w/[[Barry Windham]]) defeated [[Tully Blanchard]] (w/[[James J.

However, wrestlers cannot go for the belt until they've scored a pinfall, after which the pinned wrestler must spend some time in a penalty box.\n*'''[[Ultimate X match]]''' \u2013 Used in TNA; essentially a ladder match contested by the TNA X-Division. The match features a structure that consists of two wires strung above the ring, forming an 'X'. The wrestlers climb the structure that holds the wires, makes their way across the wires to the center of the structure, and retrieves the 'X' while hanging from the wires. Although very similar to a ladder match, ladders are rarely used as a part of an unwritten rule of sorts, with the on exception of Team 3D in [[Final Resolution (January 2008)|X14]].\n*'''Full Metal Mayhem match'''- same rules apply as Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, but steel chains can also be used.\n*'''Stairway to Hell''' \u2013 Used mainly in ECW; in this variation of the ladder match instead of a title being suspended above the ring there's a weapon, usually a ball of barbed wire or a kendo stick. Once you've taken down the weapon you are then free to use it, you win the match via pin or submission the same as a singles match. The match was contested only thrice between [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Justin Credible]], with Credible winning all the matches.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:1%;\"|#\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:20%;\"|Match\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:20%;\"|Stipulations\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:10%;\"|Event\n!  style=\"background:#e3e3e3; width:10%;\"|Date and location\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|[[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] defeated [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]\n|<small>Stairway to Hell match</small>\n|[[House Party (1998)]]\n|January 10, 1998<br>[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|[[Spike Dudley]], The Sandman and [[Tommy Dreamer]] defeated [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Buh Buh Ray Dudley]], [[D-Von Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]])\n|<small>Stairway to Hell match</small>\n|[[A Matter of Respect (1998)]]\n|May 16, 1998<br>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|[[Justin Credible]] defeated Tommy Dreamer\n|<small>Stairway to Hell match</small>\n|[[Guilty as Charged (1999)]]\n|January 10, 1999<br>[[Kissimmee, Florida]]\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|Justin Credible defeated Tommy Dreamer\n|<small>Stairway to Hell match</small>\n|''[[ECW on TNN]]''\n|January 7, 2000<br>[[White Plains, New York]]\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|Justin Credible (c) defeated Tommy Dreamer\n|<small>Stairway to Hell match for the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]]</small>\n|[[Heat Wave (2000)]]\n|July 16, 2000<br>[[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]\n|}\n*'''[[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]]''' \u2013 Variation of the ladder match where tables and chairs are also permitted (and their use is encouraged). Referred to at times simply as TLC matches.\n*'''[[Money in the Bank ladder match]]''' \u2013 Exclusively used in WWE; a Ladder match where multiple competitors try to climb a ladder to obtain a contract for a future World Title shot anytime within the next 12 months. Challenger chooses time and place. Match took place at every [[WrestleMania]] from [[WrestleMania 21]] to [[WrestleMania XXVI]], after which it was moved to the new annual [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] pay-per-view.\n*'''Tables, Ladders, and Cervezas match''' \u2013 Exclusively used in WSX; variation of the Tables, Ladder, and Chairs match except instead of permitting chairs, cervezas (Spanish for beers) is permitted along with tables and ladders (and their use is encouraged).\n*'''Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Canes match''' - This match is a TLC match with the addition of Singapore Canes.\n*'''Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Stairs match''' - This match is a TLC match with the addition of steel stairs. It was so named because the 2014 TLC event also involved a Steel Stairs match.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/laddermatch WWE.com \u2013 Ladder match description]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ladder Match}}\n[[Category:Professional wrestling match types]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Professional wrestling match type}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Raw MITB match 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' Money in the Bank ladder match at [[Money in the Bank (2011)]].]]\n\nA '''ladder match''' is a type of [[Professional wrestling match types|match in professional wrestling]], most commonly one in which an item (usually a title belt) is hung above the ring, and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item.<ref name=\"WWE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/laddermatch|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches |accessdate=2007-07-17 |publisher=WWE}}</ref> The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match, as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent(s), as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks, and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder.<ref name=\"WWE\"/>  However, there were very few matches in which the hung item must be used in a special manner in order to win the match, such as striking the opponent with the item (see [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] Vs. [[Scott Hall]] [[taser]] match, where one must strike the opponent with the taser, regardless of who retrieved the taser first).\n\nLadder matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases (usually \"containing\" a contract for a future championship match) or championship belts hung above the ring.  Ladder matches and their variants (such as [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC matches]] and [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|Full Metal Mayhem]]) are often used in feuds that involve a dispute over possession of an item (such as a stolen title belt or the \"paperwork\" for the contractual services of a manager).  Ladder matches are almost always fought under [[hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] rules.\n\n==Origins==\nThe ladder match could have been invented by either [[Dan Kroffat]] of the [[Stampede Wrestling]] organization out of [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta, Canada]] or British wrestler [[Peter Thornley|Kendo Nagasaki]]. In September 1972, Stampede Wrestling held the first ever ladder match between Dan Kroffat and [[Tor Kamata]], where the object to be grabbed was a wad of money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/history/ladder.html|title=History of the Ladder match|accessdate=|publisher=OnlineWorldofWrestling.com}}</ref> In 1987, Kendo Nagasaki competed in a \"disco challenge\" ladder match against Clive Myers on the popular ''[[World of Sport (UK TV series)|World of Sport]]''. The aim of this match was to retrieve a gold coloured disco record suspended above the ring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/icfyt/it-came-from-youtube-witness-the-disco-ladder-match/ |title=It Came From YouTube: Witness The Disco Ladder Match! - WrestleCrap - The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling! |publisher=WrestleCrap |date= |accessdate=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1983, Stampede Wrestling held a ladder match in which [[Bret Hart]] faced off against [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]]. Hart went on to join the [[World Wrestling Federation]] in 1984, and, in the early 1990s, suggested this type of match to promoter [[Vince McMahon]], years before the gimmick achieved its eventual popularity.\n\nThe first ever ladder match in the WWF, in which Hart defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Intercontinental Title, was held in Portland, ME on July 21, 1992. The match was taped but never aired on television, and remained widely unseen until its inclusion on the 2007 ''The Ladder Match'' DVD and among the bonus material on the 2011 DVD and Blu-ray collection ''WWE's Greatest Rivalries: Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart''. The two performers tell interviewer [[Jim Ross]] how the match was planned along with an intended ladder rematch that never materialized.\n\n== Ladder matches in World Wrestling

However, wrestlers cannot go for the belt until they've scored a pinfall, after which the pinned wrestler must spend some time in a penalty box.\n*'''[[Ultimate X match]]''' \u2013 Used in TNA; essentially a ladder match contested by the TNA X-Division. The match features a structure that consists of two wires strung above the ring, forming an 'X'. The wrestlers climb the structure that holds the wires, makes their way across the wires to the center of the structure, and retrieves the 'X' while hanging from the wires. Although very similar to a ladder match, ladders are rarely used as a part of an unwritten rule of sorts, with the on exception of Team 3D in [[Final Resolution (January 2008)|X14]].\n*'''Full Metal Mayhem match'''- same rules apply as Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, but steel chains can also be used.\n*'''Stairway to Hell''' \u2013 Used mainly in ECW; in this variation of the ladder match instead of a title being suspended above the ring there's a weapon, usually a ball of barbed wire or a kendo stick. Once you've taken down the weapon you are then free to use it, you win the match via pin or submission the same as a singles match.

It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.\nThe ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.<ref>{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal= European Journal of Mathematics|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 |issue=3| pages=405\u2013440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.</ref> The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the ''abc'' conjecture or its versions. {{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996}} described the ''abc'' conjecture as \"the most important unsolved problem in [[Diophantine analysis]]\".\n\nVarious attempts to prove the abc conjecture have been made, but none are currently accepted by the mainstream mathematical community and the conjecture is still largely recognized to be unproven as of 2020.<ref name=\"nature-2020\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/d41586-020-00998-2 |title=Mathematical proof that rocked number theory will be published |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|first=Davide|last=Castelvecchi |date=3 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Formulations==\nBefore we state the conjecture we introduce the notion of the  [[radical of an integer]]: for a [[positive integer]] ''n'', the radical of ''n'', denoted rad(''n''), is the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n''.

So in this case, it does not matter which concept we use.</ref> positive integers such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', it turns out that \"usually\" ''c'' < rad(''abc''). The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that\n::<math>c > \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nAn equivalent formulation:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exists a constant ''K<sub>\u03b5</sub>'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':\n::<math>c < K_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nA third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as\n\n: <math> q(a, b, c) = \\frac{ \\log(c) }{ \\log\\big(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)\\big) }.</math>\n\nFor example:\n\n:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4\u00b7127\u00b7131)) = log(131) / log(2\u00b7127\u00b7131) = 0.46820...\n:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3\u00b7125\u00b7128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...\n\nA typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' < rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') < 1. Triples with ''q'' > 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.\n\n:'''ABC conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1 + ''\u03b5''.\n\nWhereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' > 1.01 or ''q'' > 1.001 or even ''q'' > 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') that achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .\n\n==Examples of triples with small radical==\nThe condition that ''\u03b5'' > 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. For example, let\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{6n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{6n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nThe integer ''b'' is divisible by 9:\n\n:<math> b = 2^{6n} - 1  =  64^n - 1 = (64 - 1) (\\cdots) = 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (\\cdots).</math>\n\nUsing this fact we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{rad}(abc) &= \\operatorname{rad}(a) \\operatorname{rad}(b) \\operatorname{rad}(c) \\\\\n&= \\operatorname{rad}(1)  \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\operatorname{rad} \\left (2^{6n} \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 9 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\right )  \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\\\\n&= 2 \\tfrac{b}{3} \\\\\n&< \\tfrac{2}{3} c.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' > 2 be a prime and consider\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nNow we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''<sup>2</sup>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb &= 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)}\\right)^n - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)} - 1\\right) (\\cdots) \\\\\n&= p^2 \\cdot r (\\cdots).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe last step uses the fact that ''p''<sup>2</sup> divides 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''\u00a0>\u00a02, 2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''pk''\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''p''<sup>2</sup>(...)\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nAnd now with a similar calculation as above we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rad}(abc) < \\tfrac{2}{p} c.</math>\n\nA list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for\n:''a'' = 2,\n:''b'' = 3<sup>10</sup>\u00b7109 = {{val|6,436,341}},\n:''c'' = 23<sup>5</sup> = {{val|6,436,343}},\n:rad(''abc'') = {{val|15042}}.\n\n==Some consequences==\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' > 2.\n\n==Computational results==\nIn 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Distribution of triples with ''q'' > 1<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{Citation|url=http://www.rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221716/http://rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Synthese resultaten |work=RekenMeeMetABC.nl |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |language=nl }}.</ref>\n|-\n!

It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.\nThe ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.<ref>{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal= European Journal of Mathematics|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 |issue=3| pages=405\u2013440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.</ref> The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the ''abc'' conjecture or its versions. {{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996}} described the ''abc'' conjecture as \"the most important unsolved problem in [[Diophantine analysis]]\".\n\nVarious attempts to prove the abc conjecture have been made, but none are currently accepted by the mainstream mathematical community and the conjecture is still largely recognized to be unproven as of 2020.<ref name=\"nature-2020\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/d41586-020-00998-2 |title=Mathematical proof that rocked number theory will be published |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|first=Davide|last=Castelvecchi |date=3 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Formulations==\nBefore we state the conjecture we introduce the notion of the  [[radical of an integer]]: for a [[positive integer]] ''n'', the radical of ''n'', denoted rad(''n''), is the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n''.

The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that\n::<math>c > \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nAn equivalent formulation:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exists a constant ''K<sub>\u03b5</sub>'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':\n::<math>c < K_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nA third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as\n\n: <math> q(a, b, c) = \\frac{ \\log(c) }{ \\log\\big(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)\\big) }.</math>\n\nFor example:\n\n:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4\u00b7127\u00b7131)) = log(131) / log(2\u00b7127\u00b7131) = 0.46820...\n:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3\u00b7125\u00b7128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...\n\nA typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' < rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') < 1. Triples with ''q'' > 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.\n\n:'''ABC conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1 + ''\u03b5''.\n\nWhereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' > 1.01 or ''q'' > 1.001 or even ''q'' > 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') that achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .\n\n==Examples of triples with small radical==\nThe condition that ''\u03b5'' > 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. For example, let\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{6n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{6n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nThe integer ''b'' is divisible by 9:\n\n:<math> b = 2^{6n} - 1  =  64^n - 1 = (64 - 1) (\\cdots) = 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (\\cdots).</math>\n\nUsing this fact we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{rad}(abc) &= \\operatorname{rad}(a) \\operatorname{rad}(b) \\operatorname{rad}(c) \\\\\n&= \\operatorname{rad}(1)  \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\operatorname{rad} \\left (2^{6n} \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 9 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\right )  \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\\\\n&= 2 \\tfrac{b}{3} \\\\\n&< \\tfrac{2}{3} c.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' > 2 be a prime and consider\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nNow we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''<sup>2</sup>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb &= 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)}\\right)^n - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)} - 1\\right) (\\cdots) \\\\\n&= p^2 \\cdot r (\\cdots).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe last step uses the fact that ''p''<sup>2</sup> divides 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''\u00a0>\u00a02, 2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''pk''\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''p''<sup>2</sup>(...)\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nAnd now with a similar calculation as above we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rad}(abc) < \\tfrac{2}{p} c.</math>\n\nA list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for\n:''a'' = 2,\n:''b'' = 3<sup>10</sup>\u00b7109 = {{val|6,436,341}},\n:''c'' = 23<sup>5</sup> = {{val|6,436,343}},\n:rad(''abc'') = {{val|15042}}.\n\n==Some consequences==\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' > 2.\n\n==Computational results==\nIn 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Distribution of triples with ''q'' > 1<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{Citation|url=http://www.rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221716/http://rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Synthese resultaten |work=RekenMeeMetABC.nl |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |language=nl }}.</ref>\n|-\n!
