One of India's highest-paid and most popular celebrities, Chopra has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Priyanka Chopra|numerous awards]], including one [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and five [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2016, the [[Government of India]] honoured her with the [[Padma Shri]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the [[Time 100#2016|100 most influential people in the world]]. In 2017 and 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed her among the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]].\n\nAlthough Chopra initially aspired to study [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]], she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy]]'' (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits ''[[Andaaz]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mujhse Shaadi Karogi]]'' (2004) and received critical acclaim for her [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]] in the 2004 thriller ''[[Aitraaz]]''. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.\n\nFollowing a brief setback, she garnered success in 2008 for playing a troubled model in the drama ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', which won her the [[National Film Award for Best Actress]], and a glamorous journalist in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]''. Chopra gained wider recognition for portraying a range of characters in the films ''[[Kaminey]]'' (2009), ''[[7 Khoon Maaf]]'' (2011), ''[[Barfi!]]'' (2012), ''[[Mary Kom (film)|Mary Kom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015). From 2015 to 2018, she starred as [[Alex Parrish]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] thriller series ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]''. Chopra has since played supporting roles in the Hollywood comedies ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' (2017) and ''[[Isn't It Romantic (2019 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (2019), and returned to Hindi cinema with a leading role in the biopic ''[[The Sky Is Pink]]'' (2019).\n\nChopra also promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights, and is vocal about gender equality, gender pay gap, and feminism.  She has worked with [[UNICEF]] since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to unprivileged Indian children. As a recording artist, Chopra has released three [[single (music)|singles]] and provided vocals for a number of her film songs. She is also the founder of the production company [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], under which she has produced several [[Cinema of India#Regional cinema|regional Indians films]], including the acclaimed [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] film ''[[Ventilator (2016 film)|Ventilator]]'' (2016).

One of India's highest-paid and most popular celebrities, Chopra has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Priyanka Chopra|numerous awards]], including one [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and five [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2016, the [[Government of India]] honoured her with the [[Padma Shri]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the [[Time 100#2016|100 most influential people in the world]]. In 2017 and 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed her among the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]].\n\nAlthough Chopra initially aspired to study [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]], she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy]]'' (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits ''[[Andaaz]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mujhse Shaadi Karogi]]'' (2004) and received critical acclaim for her [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]] in the 2004 thriller ''[[Aitraaz]]''. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.\n\nFollowing a brief setback, she garnered success in 2008 for playing a troubled model in the drama ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', which won her the [[National Film Award for Best Actress]], and a glamorous journalist in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]''. Chopra gained wider recognition for portraying a range of characters in the films ''[[Kaminey]]'' (2009), ''[[7 Khoon Maaf]]'' (2011), ''[[Barfi!]]'' (2012), ''[[Mary Kom (film)|Mary Kom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015). From 2015 to 2018, she starred as [[Alex Parrish]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] thriller series ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]''. Chopra has since played supporting roles in the Hollywood comedies ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' (2017) and ''[[Isn't It Romantic (2019 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (2019), and returned to Hindi cinema with a leading role in the biopic ''[[The Sky Is Pink]]'' (2019).\n\nChopra also promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights, and is vocal about gender equality, gender pay gap, and feminism.  She has worked with [[UNICEF]] since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to unprivileged Indian children. As a recording artist, Chopra has released three [[single (music)|singles]] and provided vocals for a number of her film songs. She is also the founder of the production company [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], under which she has produced several [[Cinema of India#Regional cinema|regional Indians films]], including the acclaimed [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] film ''[[Ventilator (2016 film)|Ventilator]]'' (2016). Despite maintaining privacy, Chopra's off-screen life, including her marriage to the American singer and actor [[Nick Jonas]], is the subject of substantial media coverage.\n\n==Early life==\nPriyanka Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in [[Jamshedpur]], [[Bihar]] (present-day [[Jharkhand]]), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the [[Indian Army]].<ref name=bday1>{{cite web|title=Birthday Special: 30 Facts About Priyanka Chopra |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-birthday-special-priyanka-chopra/20120718.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926075555/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-birthday-special-priyanka-chopra/20120718.htm |archivedate=26 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=bday2>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Birthday-blast-Priyanka-Chopra-s-Top-30-moments-in-showbiz/Article1-890611.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718055252/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Birthday-blast-Priyanka-Chopra-s-Top-30-moments-in-showbiz/Article1-890611.aspx|archivedate=18 July 2012|title=Birthday blast: Priyanka Chopra's Top 30 moments in showbiz |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=17 July 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Her father was a [[Punjabi Hindu]] from [[Ambala]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"I'll get married six times\" \u2013 Priyanka Chopra |url=http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/ill-get-married-six-times-priyanka-chopra-4412.html |work=[[Filmfare]] |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806083606/http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/ill-get-married-six-times-priyanka-chopra-4412.html |archivedate= 6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priyanka-Chopra-missed-visiting-her-hometown-Ambala/articleshow/47502145.cms |title=Priyanka Chopra missed visiting her hometown Ambala |author=Batra, Ankur |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708160043/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priyanka-Chopra-missed-visiting-her-hometown-Ambala/articleshow/47502145.cms |archivedate= 8 July 2015}}</ref> Her mother Madhu Chopra from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] veteran<ref>{{cite web|title=Much ado about Adieu |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Much-ado-about-Adieu/2016/06/12/article3478145.ece |author=Chandran, Abhilash |work=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=12 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613134407/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Much-ado-about-Adieu/2016/06/12/article3478145.ece |archivedate=13 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyanka-chopra-harassed-by-unknown-man/143892-8-66.html |title=Priyanka Chopra harassed by unknown man |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204003258/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyanka-chopra-harassed-by-unknown-man/143892-8-66.html |archivedate= 4 December 2013}}</ref> and Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri (n\u00e9e Mary John), a former member of [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]].

Some older Rhythm Games that returned in ''Megamix'' (such as ''Karate Man'', ''Glee Club'' and ''Air Rally''), received a prequel version, An easier version with new graphics and an alternated music (to match the music style of the new rhythm games featured in ''Megamix''), while the original Rhythm Games have been labeled as sequels.\n\nSome of the returning games from ''Tengoku'' and ''Heaven (DS)'' have been added new music and redesigned graphics. Outside of the Story Mode, players can attempt Perfect Campaigns, which require players to clear selected stages without making any mistakes, or take on challenges on the Challenge Train, which can be played with up to four players via [[Nintendo DS#Download Play|Download Play]]. The Challenge Mode in the game also has two ''[[WarioWare]]'' crossover challenges named as \"[[Wario]]... Where?\", which replaces some of the rhythm games' main characters with characters from the ''WarioWare'' series (This is due to both the ''WarioWare'' and ''Rhythm Heaven'' franchises being made by the same developers).

While some music pieces from the original ''Rhythm Tengoku'' and ''Rhythm Heaven (DS)'' were re-used, ''Rhythm Heaven Megamix'' re-uses several music themes from the previous game, ''Rhythm Heaven Fever''. For the prequel versions of older rhythm games from previous titles and for the new rhythm games and remixes in the game, most of the music that Tsunku\u2642 had composed for them was given a techno-themed motif.

The new vocal songs for ''Megamix'' are \"Story Of True Love\" (used for the Lush Remix), \"I'm a lady now/Hotzmic\" (used for the Honeybee Remix) and \"In the Big Grain Of Tears\" (used for the Machine Remix).

The [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below-average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter Outlook: Warmer than average for many, wetter in the North: Drought improvement expected in the Southeast|url=https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-warmer-than-average-for-many-wetter-in-north|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 17, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Early November winter storm ===\nRecord breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November.

The [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below-average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter Outlook: Warmer than average for many, wetter in the North: Drought improvement expected in the Southeast|url=https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-warmer-than-average-for-many-wetter-in-north|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 17, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Early November winter storm ===\nRecord breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November.

It is also possible that high degree block can result after cardiac surgery during which the surgeon was in close proximity to the electrical conduction system and accidentally injured it. Reversible causes of Mobitz II and third-degree heart block include untreated [[Lyme disease]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[hyperkalemia]] (high levels of potassium), and drug toxicity. Drugs that slow the conduction of the electrical signal through AV node, such as [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[digoxin]], [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium channel blockers]], and [[amiodarone]], can cause heart block if they are taken in excessive amounts, or the levels in the blood get too high.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Management ==\nManagement is dependent upon the severity, or degree, of the blockage, the consistency of symptoms, as well as the cause of the AV block.\n\nPatients with [[First-degree atrioventricular block|first-degree AV block]] do not have any resulting severe or life-threatening symptoms, such as symptomatic [[bradycardia]] or [[hypotension]], and, thus, do not require treatment.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nSimilarly, patients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz I AV block]] rarely develop life-threatening symptoms, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require treatment.

These patients often respond well to [[atropine]], but make require temporary [[transcutaneous pacing]] or [[transvenous pacing]] until they are not longer symptomatic.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPatients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz II]] and [[Third-degree atrioventricular block|third-degree heart block]] are much more likely to have symptomatic [[bradycardia]] and hemodynamic instability, such as [[hypotension]]. Additionally, there is an increased risk of patients with Mobitz II heart block developing third-degree heart block.

An ECG is used to differentiate between the different types of AV block.\n[[File:Heart block.png|thumb|Representative electrocardiogram recordings of the different degrees of heart block.]]\n\n=== First-degree Atrioventricular Block ===\n[[First-degree atrioventricular block|First-degree AV block]] occurs when there is a delay, but not disruption, as the electrical signal moves between the atrium and the ventricles through the AV node.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hb/types|title=Types of Heart Block - NHLBI, NIH|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>  On ECG, this is defined by a [[PR interval]] greater than 200 msec.

On ECG, this is defined by a progressive prolongation of the PR interval, with a resulting dropped beat (the PR interval gets longer and longer until a beat is finally dropped, or skipped).<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSome patients are asymptomatic; those who have symptoms respond to treatment effectively. There is low risk of a Mobitz I AV block leading to heart attack and complete heart block.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Mobitz II ====\nMobitz II is caused by a sudden, unexpected failure of the His-Purkinje cells to conduct the electrical impulse. On ECG, the PR interval is unchanged from beat to beat, but there is a sudden failure to conduct the signal to the ventricles, and a resulting random skipped beat.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe risks and possible effects of Mobitz II are much more severe than Mobitz I in that it can lead to severe heart attack.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wogan|first=J.

None of the signals from the upper chambers make it to the lower chambers. On ECG, there is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes, meaning the P waves and QRS complexes are not in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThird-degree AV block is the most severe of the AV blocks.

Common causes include [[ischemia]] (lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle) or progressive [[fibrosis]] (excessive scaring) of the heart. It is also possible that high degree block can result after cardiac surgery during which the surgeon was in close proximity to the electrical conduction system and accidentally injured it. Reversible causes of Mobitz II and third-degree heart block include untreated [[Lyme disease]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[hyperkalemia]] (high levels of potassium), and drug toxicity. Drugs that slow the conduction of the electrical signal through AV node, such as [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[digoxin]], [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium channel blockers]], and [[amiodarone]], can cause heart block if they are taken in excessive amounts, or the levels in the blood get too high.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Management ==\nManagement is dependent upon the severity, or degree, of the blockage, the consistency of symptoms, as well as the cause of the AV block.\n\nPatients with [[First-degree atrioventricular block|first-degree AV block]] do not have any resulting severe or life-threatening symptoms, such as symptomatic [[bradycardia]] or [[hypotension]], and, thus, do not require treatment.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nSimilarly, patients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz I AV block]] rarely develop life-threatening symptoms, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require treatment. However, in some cases, patients with Mobtz I block can develop life-threatening symptoms that requires intervention. These patients often respond well to [[atropine]], but make require temporary [[transcutaneous pacing]] or [[transvenous pacing]] until they are not longer symptomatic.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPatients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz II]] and [[Third-degree atrioventricular block|third-degree heart block]] are much more likely to have symptomatic [[bradycardia]] and hemodynamic instability, such as [[hypotension]]. Additionally, there is an increased risk of patients with Mobitz II heart block developing third-degree heart block. Therefore, these patients often require temporary pacing with [[Transcutaneous pacing|transcutaneous]] or [[transvenous pacing]] wires, and many will ultimately require a permanent implanted [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]].<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> \n\nIf the heart block is found to be caused by a reversible condition, such as Lyme disease, the underlying condition should first be treated. Often times, this will lead to resolution of the heart block and the associated symptoms.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|I|44|0|i|30}}-{{ICD10|I|44|3|i|30}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|426.0}}-{{ICD9|426.1}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = med\n| eMedicineTopic  = 189\n| MeshID          = D054537\n| SNOMED CT       = 233917008\n}}\n\n*{{EMedicine|article|161919|Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block}}\n\n{{Circulatory system pathology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atrioventricular Block}}\n[[Category:Cardiac arrhythmia]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4061:210f:baf3::e4e:b0", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFirst-degree Atrioventricular Block)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_block"}
