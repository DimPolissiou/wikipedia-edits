It is located in the district of [[Wesel (district)|Wesel]].\n\nXanten is known for the ''Archaeological Park'', one of the largest [[archaeological open air museum]]s in the world, built at the site of the Roman settlements ''Colonia Ulpia Traiana''. Other attractions include the medieval town centre with [[Xanten Cathedral]], many museums and large man-made lakes for various watersport activities. Xanten is visited by approximately one million tourists a year.\n\n==Geography==\nXanten, the only German town whose name begins with ''X'',<ref>[http://www.mygermancity.com/german-cities-x German Cities \u2014 Letter X]</ref> is made up of three boroughs (''[[Ortsteil]]e''): ''Hochbruch'', ''Niederbruch'', and the ''town centre''. Other localities (''Bezirke'')  belonging to the town of Xanten include ''Birten'', ''L\u00fcttingen'', ''Marienbaum'', ''Vynen'', ''Oberm\u00f6rmter'', ''Wardt'', ''M\u00f6rmter'', ''Willich'', ''Beek'' and ''Ursel''. Parts of a nature reserve called ''Bislicher Insel'' are located in the municipality as well.\n\nThe town borders the [[Lower Rhine]] and the town of [[Rees, Germany|Rees]] to the north, the town of [[Wesel]] to the east, the municipalities of [[Alpen, Germany|Alpen]] and [[Sonsbeck]] to the south, and the towns of [[Uedem]] and [[Kalkar]] to the west.\n\nThe closest international airport is [[Weeze Airport]] (also called Niederrhein Airport; Ryanair hub) in [[Weeze]] (25&nbsp;km); the closest intercontinental airport is [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]] (60&nbsp;km).\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:Silvered-bronze horse trappings from Xanten (BM).JPG|thumb|left|[[Xanten Horse-Phalerae|Set of Roman silvered-bronze horse trappings from Xanten]], now in the [[British Museum]]<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/military_horse_trapping.aspx British Museum Highlights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203083856/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/military_horse_trapping.aspx |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref></blockquote>]]\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[Image:Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten DE.png|thumb|right|Colonia Ulpia Traiana, Tricensimae, Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten]]\n[[Image:Amphitheater Xanten.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed Roman amphitheatre in Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten]]\n\nThe first settlements by isolated tribes can be dated to around the year 2000 BC. Around 15 BC the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[Castra|castrum]]'' or camp ''[[:de:Vetera|Vetera]]'' was created on the F\u00fcrstenberg near modern-day Birten. It was intended as a base for campaigns into [[Germania]] and until its destruction during the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in 70 AD it was occupied by 8,000 to 10,000 legionaries, and was the main base of the [[Roman Navy#Classis Germanica|Classis germanica]].\n\nAfter the destruction of ''Vetera'' a second camp became established at the [[Bislicher Insel]], named ''Castra Vetera II'', which became the base camp of [[Legio VI Victrix]]. A nearby created settlement, which was inhabited by 10,000 to 15,000 former legionaries and others, was given the rights of a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] in 110 AD by the Roman emperor Marcus Ulpius [[Traianus]], who renamed the town ''Colonia Ulpia Traiana''. The colonia was a completely new town with a town wall and other buildings like an amphitheater. For this town the old settlement was completely destroyed. The colonia became the second most important commercial post in the province of [[Germania Inferior]], surpassed only by ''Colonia Agrippinensis'' (today's [[Cologne]]). In 122, ''Vetera II'' became the camp of [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]], replacing VI Victrix which had moved to [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].\n\nIn 275 the colonia was almost destroyed by Germanic tribes. Subsequently, in 310 in the area of the colonia a new town was established, named ''Tricensimae'' (\"of the Thirtieth\"), which was built on the nine central ''[[Insula (building)|insula]]'' of the former colonia but fortified and more easily defended. At the beginning of the 5th century, assaults by Germanic tribes rapidly increased, with the result that ''Tricensimae'' was finally given up.\n\nIn 363, during the reign of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the Christian [[Viktor of Xanten]] is supposed to have been executed together with 360 other members of the [[Theban Legion]] near the modern town of Birten for refusing to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Considered a [[martyr]] and a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Viktor of Xanten is commemorated in [[Xanten Cathedral]], where his [[relic]]s are kept in a shrine embedded in the high altar.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Image:Xanten Klever Tor.jpg|thumb|''Klever Tor'' in Xanten.]] \nIn the 5th century the [[Franks]] began to settle in the area of today's Xanten, but no urban settlements have been found from this time as the Franks did not build in stone, unlike the Romans. Only graves from this time have been discovered.\n\nAccording to the legend of the [[Nibelungs]], the mythical [[Sigurd|Siegfried of Xanten]] was born ''ze Santen an dem Rh\u00eene''.\n\nIn the second half of the 8th century a church was built on the grounds of an old cemetery of the ancient Roman colony and called ''Sanctos (super Rhenum)'' (also mentioned as ''ad Sanctum''). The name of \"place of saints\" was derived from the assumed grave of the martyr [[Viktor of Xanten]] and is the source of today's municipal name of ''Xanten''. After the establishment of a convent to the south, what became today's town centre grew into existence.\n\nIn 939 troops under [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]] defeated rebellious Franconian, Saxon and Lotharingian troops under [[Eberhard of Franconia]] in the Battle of Birten near Xanten. Following the [[Battle of Andernach]] the same year the Rhineland was reaffirmed to the kingdom of Otto I.\n\nWhile Xanten, with its rich ''Viktor Convent'', was still being besieged by [[Norsemen]] in 863, in 1122 the place already appears as part of a trading network at the Lower Rhine. On 15 July 1228, Xanten was given town rights by the [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Heinrich of Molenark]].\n\nXanten had a Jewish community in early medieval times. Two massacres of Jews occurred during the [[First Crusade]], on (1 and 27 June 1096). On the latter occasion some Jews committed suicide in order to escape the fury of the Crusaders.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nIn 1263 the foundation stone for the Gothic [[Xanten Cathedral|St. Victor cathedral]] was laid. After 281 years of construction it was finally completed in 1544. By the end of the 14th century, Xanten was surrounded by a town wall.\n\nIn 1392 the northern part of the town came into the possession of the [[Duchy of Cleves|Dukes of Cleves]], while the southern part remained with the Archbishopric of Cologne. The division of Xanten was a cause of a conflict between Cleves and Cologne, which ended when the whole of Xanten was awarded to the Duchy of Cleves in 1444.\n\n===Early Modern period===\nAfter being taken by the Dukes of Cleves, in the wake of war and crop failure, the number of inhabitants slumped from 5,000 at the beginning of the 16th century to approximately 2,500 by the end of the 18th century. The Rhine had been a basis of Xanten's status as a trading town until the river bed shifted away from the town, causing its economic situation to deteriorate. The river even flooded and destroyed the locality of Birten several times.\n\nThe borough Marienbaum, however, became the main place of pilgrimage on the Lower Rhine between 1430 and 1441. In 1460  a monastery of the [[Bridgettines]] was established, with an abbey church called ''St. Mari\u00e4 Himmelfahrt'' ([[Assumption of Mary]]) which nowadays serves as a parish church.\n\nIn the 17th century Xanten was (along with Cleves) inherited by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. [[Protestantism]] was placed on an equal footing with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as confirmed by the ''[[Treaty of Xanten]]'' on 12 November 1614. Thereupon a church was built at the ''Gro\u00dfer Markt'' (Great Marketplace), which was expanded with a spire in 1622. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 20th century only 5% of the population were of Protestant denomination. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Protestant share of the population had increased to some 20%.\n\n===19th and early 20th century===\nIn 1802, the Viktor-convent was secularized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], and the libraries of closed monasteries and the convent library were merged. After that, the economic situation deteriorated more rapidly. A town gate called the ''Marstor'' was torn down in 1821, and the ''Scharntor'' and parts of the town walls were removed in 1825. The removal of the ''Klever Tor'' and a mill called ''Kriemhildm\u00fchle'' was prevented by a town councillor in 1843. At the same time, the ruins of the ''Colonia Ulpia Traiana'', which had been used as a quarry since the Roman settlement was given up, aroused the interest of archaeologists.\n\nXanten was administered within the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]] from 1822 to 1945. Between 1819 and 1844, excavations were carried out at the Roman ruins. In September 1927, the Catholic Church municipality celebrated its 1,600th&nbsp;anniversary; in 1937 [[Pope Pius XI]] granted the right for the cathedral of ''St. Viktor'' to be called a [[basilica minor]].\n\nIn the later part of the 19th century, there was a high-profile case of alleged ritual murder, also known as [[blood libel]]. On 29 June 1891, Johann Hegemann, the five-year-old son of a local cabinet maker, was found dead in a neighbour's barn, with his throat cut from ear to ear. [[Anti-Semitic]] agitation connected the Jewish butcher and former [[Shechita|sho\u1e25e\u1e6d]] Adolf Buschoff with this crime, and the local priest, Father Bresser, lent support to this rumour by publishing articles on ritual murder in the paper ''Bote f\u00fcr Stadt und Land'', which he edited. The agitation in the anti-Semitic press, as well as at anti-semitic meetings, where it was insinuated that the Jews had bribed or intimidated the authorities in order to prevent the discovery of the truth, compelled the government to arrest Buschoff and his family (14 October 1891). The evidence against the man, who had always borne a good reputation, was so flimsy, however, that he was discharged (20 December). This action aroused the anti-Semites to still stronger agitation, which culminated in a heated debate in the Prussian Diet. In the course of this argument, Stoecker, the ex-court chaplain, repeated the accusation of ritual murder, and hinted at Jewish influence as the cause of the failure to find the murderer (7 February 1892). Under pressure from this agitation, Buschoff was rearrested (8 February), and tried before a jury at Cleves (4\u201314 July 1892). During this trial, it was found that the accusations were based on mere hearsay, and contained impossible assertions. The prosecuting attorney himself moved for the dismissal of the charge, and the jury rendered its verdict accordingly. The real murderer was never discovered, and the possibility that the death of the child was due to an accident was not entirely disproved. The agitation had the effect of reducing the Jewish population of the town, and Buschoff himself had to leave. In 1905, Xanten had about thirty Jews out of a total population of 3,770.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nIn 1933, mayor Heinrich Wagner was locked up in a tower called the ''Meerturm'', accused of alleged nepotism in the loan business. His successor was Friedrich Karl Sch\u00f6neborn, while the post of deputy mayor was given to Heinrich Prang junior. Prang had already created a local group of the [[NSDAP]] in 1925. As the local council of the ''Deutsche Zentrumspartei'' was dissolved, three of formerly eight town council members were group members of the NSDAP. The remaining opposition consisted of [[communists]] and liberal politicians lacking a clear political mandate.\n\nThe following years saw harassment of the Jewish population of Xanten. This included the destruction of the local prayer room and the devastation of several dwellings of Jewish inhabitants on ''[[Reichskristallnacht]]'' of 9 November 1938. After these events, the entire Jewish population fled Xanten. In May 1940, the German 256th infantry division was transferred to Xanten to take part in the forthcoming [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]].  During the [[Second World War]] an ammunition factory of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was established in a small forest close to the town, called ''Die Hees''. While citizens of Xanten worked there at the beginning of the war, women and children, and especially foreigners were forced to perform hard labour at the plant as the war progressed. Incidents in the area of the factory occurred in November 1942 and October 1944, causing the explosion of a portion of the stored ammunition, which cost several workers' lives. \n\nWhen allied troops reached Xanten in February 1945, mayor Sch\u00f6neborn left the town. With him fled almost the entire town administration to areas to the east. In the same month the bombardment of the town had begun, killing civilians and destroying parts of Xanten. In addition, the cathedral was hit by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombs]] and damaged heavily. On 8 March 1945, Xanten was finally taken by Canadian troops. The Canadian military lost, according to their own data, 400 soldiers in the fight against the defending ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroops) under the command of [[Eugen Meindl]]. Thereupon the town, 85% of which had already been destroyed, was occupied by British troops while the population was evacuated to [[Bedburg-Hau]] in preparation for the crossing of the Rhine near the town of Wesel. Artillery projectiles fired by German soldiers from the right bank of the Rhine further devastated Xanten at this time. When the crossing of the Rhine finally succeeded on 24 March 1945, the Second World War was over for Xanten.\n\n===Post-World War II===\nThe reconstruction of the town and the cathedral was influenced particularly by the archaeologist and monument conservationist Walter Bader, and lasted until 1966. [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|Expellees]] from [[East Prussia]] were resettled in Xanten and caused the population to rise by almost 40%. In the course of the local re-organization in 1969, the localities ''Birten'', ''L\u00fcttingen'', ''Marienbaum'', ''Oberm\u00f6rmter'', ''Vynen'' and ''Wardt'' were integrated into Xanten, so that around 16,000 inhabitants lived within the town boundaries. The area of the town increased from 8&nbsp;km\u00b2 to 72&nbsp;km\u00b2. \n[[Image:Xanten.JPG|thumb|left|Reconstructed corner of the ''Hafentempel'' (harbor temple) in ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten'']]\n\nIn 1975, the ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten'' (Xanten Archaeological Park), a partial reconstruction of the ''Roman Colonia Ulpia Traiana'', was established and opened for tourism.\n\nOn 28 November 1988, Xanten was granted the title of a ''Staatlich anerkannter Erholungsort'' (state-recognized leisure town) as the first such town in the [[D\u00fcsseldorf (region)|region of D\u00fcsseldorf]]. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of inhabitants rose from 16,930 to about 22,000.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten'' is built on the site of the Roman town, and it is one of the most frequently visited parks in Germany. In 2012, the Archaeological Park was expanded to nearly the whole area of the Roman colonia after Bundesstra\u00dfe 57 was moved away from the area.\n\nHistorical buildings in the town centre have been restored. At the ''Xantener S\u00fcdsee'' and ''Xantener Nordsee'', two lakes connected by a channel close to the localities Wardt and Vynen, the ''Freizeitzentrum Xanten'' (Xanten Leisure Center) was established in 1982.

It is located in the district of [[Wesel (district)|Wesel]].\n\nXanten is known for the ''Archaeological Park'', one of the largest [[archaeological open air museum]]s in the world, built at the site of the Roman settlements ''Colonia Ulpia Traiana''. Other attractions include the medieval town centre with [[Xanten Cathedral]], many museums and large man-made lakes for various watersport activities. Xanten is visited by approximately one million tourists a year.\n\n==Geography==\nXanten, the only German town whose name begins with ''X'',<ref>[http://www.mygermancity.com/german-cities-x German Cities \u2014 Letter X]</ref> is made up of three boroughs (''[[Ortsteil]]e''): ''Hochbruch'', ''Niederbruch'', and the ''town centre''. Other localities (''Bezirke'')  belonging to the town of Xanten include ''Birten'', ''L\u00fcttingen'', ''Marienbaum'', ''Vynen'', ''Oberm\u00f6rmter'', ''Wardt'', ''M\u00f6rmter'', ''Willich'', ''Beek'' and ''Ursel''. Parts of a nature reserve called ''Bislicher Insel'' are located in the municipality as well.\n\nThe town borders the [[Lower Rhine]] and the town of [[Rees, Germany|Rees]] to the north, the town of [[Wesel]] to the east, the municipalities of [[Alpen, Germany|Alpen]] and [[Sonsbeck]] to the south, and the towns of [[Uedem]] and [[Kalkar]] to the west.\n\nThe closest international airport is [[Weeze Airport]] (also called Niederrhein Airport; Ryanair hub) in [[Weeze]] (25&nbsp;km); the closest intercontinental airport is [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]] (60&nbsp;km).\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:Silvered-bronze horse trappings from Xanten (BM).JPG|thumb|left|[[Xanten Horse-Phalerae|Set of Roman silvered-bronze horse trappings from Xanten]], now in the [[British Museum]]<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/military_horse_trapping.aspx British Museum Highlights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203083856/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/military_horse_trapping.aspx |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref></blockquote>]]\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[Image:Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten DE.png|thumb|right|Colonia Ulpia Traiana, Tricensimae, Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten]]\n[[Image:Amphitheater Xanten.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed Roman amphitheatre in Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten]]\n\nThe first settlements by isolated tribes can be dated to around the year 2000 BC. Around 15 BC the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[Castra|castrum]]'' or camp ''[[:de:Vetera|Vetera]]'' was created on the F\u00fcrstenberg near modern-day Birten. It was intended as a base for campaigns into [[Germania]] and until its destruction during the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in 70 AD it was occupied by 8,000 to 10,000 legionaries, and was the main base of the [[Roman Navy#Classis Germanica|Classis germanica]].\n\nAfter the destruction of ''Vetera'' a second camp became established at the [[Bislicher Insel]], named ''Castra Vetera II'', which became the base camp of [[Legio VI Victrix]]. A nearby created settlement, which was inhabited by 10,000 to 15,000 former legionaries and others, was given the rights of a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] in 110 AD by the Roman emperor Marcus Ulpius [[Traianus]], who renamed the town ''Colonia Ulpia Traiana''. The colonia was a completely new town with a town wall and other buildings like an amphitheater. For this town the old settlement was completely destroyed. The colonia became the second most important commercial post in the province of [[Germania Inferior]], surpassed only by ''Colonia Agrippinensis'' (today's [[Cologne]]). In 122, ''Vetera II'' became the camp of [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]], replacing VI Victrix which had moved to [[Roman Britain|Britannia]].\n\nIn 275 the colonia was almost destroyed by Germanic tribes. Subsequently, in 310 in the area of the colonia a new town was established, named ''Tricensimae'' (\"of the Thirtieth\"), which was built on the nine central ''[[Insula (building)|insula]]'' of the former colonia but fortified and more easily defended. At the beginning of the 5th century, assaults by Germanic tribes rapidly increased, with the result that ''Tricensimae'' was finally given up.\n\nIn 363, during the reign of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the Christian [[Viktor of Xanten]] is supposed to have been executed together with 360 other members of the [[Theban Legion]] near the modern town of Birten for refusing to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Considered a [[martyr]] and a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Viktor of Xanten is commemorated in [[Xanten Cathedral]], where his [[relic]]s are kept in a shrine embedded in the high altar.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[Image:Xanten Klever Tor.jpg|thumb|''Klever Tor'' in Xanten.]] \nIn the 5th century the [[Franks]] began to settle in the area of today's Xanten, but no urban settlements have been found from this time as the Franks did not build in stone, unlike the Romans. Only graves from this time have been discovered.\n\nAccording to the legend of the [[Nibelungs]], the mythical [[Sigurd|Siegfried of Xanten]] was born ''ze Santen an dem Rh\u00eene''.\n\nIn the second half of the 8th century a church was built on the grounds of an old cemetery of the ancient Roman colony and called ''Sanctos (super Rhenum)'' (also mentioned as ''ad Sanctum''). The name of \"place of saints\" was derived from the assumed grave of the martyr [[Viktor of Xanten]] and is the source of today's municipal name of ''Xanten''. After the establishment of a convent to the south, what became today's town centre grew into existence.\n\nIn 939 troops under [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]] defeated rebellious Franconian, Saxon and Lotharingian troops under [[Eberhard of Franconia]] in the Battle of Birten near Xanten. Following the [[Battle of Andernach]] the same year the Rhineland was reaffirmed to the kingdom of Otto I.\n\nWhile Xanten, with its rich ''Viktor Convent'', was still being besieged by [[Norsemen]] in 863, in 1122 the place already appears as part of a trading network at the Lower Rhine. On 15 July 1228, Xanten was given town rights by the [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Heinrich of Molenark]].\n\nXanten had a Jewish community in early medieval times. Two massacres of Jews occurred during the [[First Crusade]], on (1 and 27 June 1096). On the latter occasion some Jews committed suicide in order to escape the fury of the Crusaders.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nIn 1263 the foundation stone for the Gothic [[Xanten Cathedral|St. Victor cathedral]] was laid. After 281 years of construction it was finally completed in 1544. By the end of the 14th century, Xanten was surrounded by a town wall.\n\nIn 1392 the northern part of the town came into the possession of the [[Duchy of Cleves|Dukes of Cleves]], while the southern part remained with the Archbishopric of Cologne. The division of Xanten was a cause of a conflict between Cleves and Cologne, which ended when the whole of Xanten was awarded to the Duchy of Cleves in 1444.\n\n===Early Modern period===\nAfter being taken by the Dukes of Cleves, in the wake of war and crop failure, the number of inhabitants slumped from 5,000 at the beginning of the 16th century to approximately 2,500 by the end of the 18th century. The Rhine had been a basis of Xanten's status as a trading town until the river bed shifted away from the town, causing its economic situation to deteriorate. The river even flooded and destroyed the locality of Birten several times.\n\nThe borough Marienbaum, however, became the main place of pilgrimage on the Lower Rhine between 1430 and 1441. In 1460  a monastery of the [[Bridgettines]] was established, with an abbey church called ''St. Mari\u00e4 Himmelfahrt'' ([[Assumption of Mary]]) which nowadays serves as a parish church.\n\nIn the 17th century Xanten was (along with Cleves) inherited by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. [[Protestantism]] was placed on an equal footing with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as confirmed by the ''[[Treaty of Xanten]]'' on 12 November 1614. Thereupon a church was built at the ''Gro\u00dfer Markt'' (Great Marketplace), which was expanded with a spire in 1622. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 20th century only 5% of the population were of Protestant denomination. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Protestant share of the population had increased to some 20%.\n\n===19th and early 20th century===\nIn 1802, the Viktor-convent was secularized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], and the libraries of closed monasteries and the convent library were merged. After that, the economic situation deteriorated more rapidly. A town gate called the ''Marstor'' was torn down in 1821, and the ''Scharntor'' and parts of the town walls were removed in 1825. The removal of the ''Klever Tor'' and a mill called ''Kriemhildm\u00fchle'' was prevented by a town councillor in 1843. At the same time, the ruins of the ''Colonia Ulpia Traiana'', which had been used as a quarry since the Roman settlement was given up, aroused the interest of archaeologists.\n\nXanten was administered within the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]] from 1822 to 1945. Between 1819 and 1844, excavations were carried out at the Roman ruins. In September 1927, the Catholic Church municipality celebrated its 1,600th&nbsp;anniversary; in 1937 [[Pope Pius XI]] granted the right for the cathedral of ''St. Viktor'' to be called a [[basilica minor]].\n\nIn the later part of the 19th century, there was a high-profile case of alleged ritual murder, also known as [[blood libel]]. On 29 June 1891, Johann Hegemann, the five-year-old son of a local cabinet maker, was found dead in a neighbour's barn, with his throat cut from ear to ear. [[Anti-Semitic]] agitation connected the Jewish butcher and former [[Shechita|sho\u1e25e\u1e6d]] Adolf Buschoff with this crime, and the local priest, Father Bresser, lent support to this rumour by publishing articles on ritual murder in the paper ''Bote f\u00fcr Stadt und Land'', which he edited. The agitation in the anti-Semitic press, as well as at anti-semitic meetings, where it was insinuated that the Jews had bribed or intimidated the authorities in order to prevent the discovery of the truth, compelled the government to arrest Buschoff and his family (14 October 1891). The evidence against the man, who had always borne a good reputation, was so flimsy, however, that he was discharged (20 December). This action aroused the anti-Semites to still stronger agitation, which culminated in a heated debate in the Prussian Diet. In the course of this argument, Stoecker, the ex-court chaplain, repeated the accusation of ritual murder, and hinted at Jewish influence as the cause of the failure to find the murderer (7 February 1892). Under pressure from this agitation, Buschoff was rearrested (8 February), and tried before a jury at Cleves (4\u201314 July 1892). During this trial, it was found that the accusations were based on mere hearsay, and contained impossible assertions. The prosecuting attorney himself moved for the dismissal of the charge, and the jury rendered its verdict accordingly. The real murderer was never discovered, and the possibility that the death of the child was due to an accident was not entirely disproved. The agitation had the effect of reducing the Jewish population of the town, and Buschoff himself had to leave. In 1905, Xanten had about thirty Jews out of a total population of 3,770.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nIn 1933, mayor Heinrich Wagner was locked up in a tower called the ''Meerturm'', accused of alleged nepotism in the loan business. His successor was Friedrich Karl Sch\u00f6neborn, while the post of deputy mayor was given to Heinrich Prang junior. Prang had already created a local group of the [[NSDAP]] in 1925. As the local council of the ''Deutsche Zentrumspartei'' was dissolved, three of formerly eight town council members were group members of the NSDAP. The remaining opposition consisted of [[communists]] and liberal politicians lacking a clear political mandate.\n\nThe following years saw harassment of the Jewish population of Xanten. This included the destruction of the local prayer room and the devastation of several dwellings of Jewish inhabitants on ''[[Reichskristallnacht]]'' of 9 November 1938. After these events, the entire Jewish population fled Xanten. In May 1940, the German 256th infantry division was transferred to Xanten to take part in the forthcoming [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]].  During the [[Second World War]] an ammunition factory of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was established in a small forest close to the town, called ''Die Hees''. While citizens of Xanten worked there at the beginning of the war, women and children, and especially foreigners were forced to perform hard labour at the plant as the war progressed. Incidents in the area of the factory occurred in November 1942 and October 1944, causing the explosion of a portion of the stored ammunition, which cost several workers' lives. \n\nWhen allied troops reached Xanten in February 1945, mayor Sch\u00f6neborn left the town. With him fled almost the entire town administration to areas to the east. In the same month the bombardment of the town had begun, killing civilians and destroying parts of Xanten. In addition, the cathedral was hit by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombs]] and damaged heavily. On 8 March 1945, Xanten was finally taken by Canadian troops. The Canadian military lost, according to their own data, 400 soldiers in the fight against the defending ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroops) under the command of [[Eugen Meindl]]. Thereupon the town, 85% of which had already been destroyed, was occupied by British troops while the population was evacuated to [[Bedburg-Hau]] in preparation for the crossing of the Rhine near the town of Wesel. Artillery projectiles fired by German soldiers from the right bank of the Rhine further devastated Xanten at this time. When the crossing of the Rhine finally succeeded on 24 March 1945, the Second World War was over for Xanten.\n\n===Post-World War II===\nThe reconstruction of the town and the cathedral was influenced particularly by the archaeologist and monument conservationist Walter Bader, and lasted until 1966. [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|Expellees]] from [[East Prussia]] were resettled in Xanten and caused the population to rise by almost 40%. In the course of the local re-organization in 1969, the localities ''Birten'', ''L\u00fcttingen'', ''Marienbaum'', ''Oberm\u00f6rmter'', ''Vynen'' and ''Wardt'' were integrated into Xanten, so that around 16,000 inhabitants lived within the town boundaries. The area of the town increased from 8&nbsp;km\u00b2 to 72&nbsp;km\u00b2. \n[[Image:Xanten.JPG|thumb|left|Reconstructed corner of the ''Hafentempel'' (harbor temple) in ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten'']]\n\nIn 1975, the ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten'' (Xanten Archaeological Park), a partial reconstruction of the ''Roman Colonia Ulpia Traiana'', was established and opened for tourism.\n\nOn 28 November 1988, Xanten was granted the title of a ''Staatlich anerkannter Erholungsort'' (state-recognized leisure town) as the first such town in the [[D\u00fcsseldorf (region)|region of D\u00fcsseldorf]]. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of inhabitants rose from 16,930 to about 22,000.\n\n==Attractions==\nThe ''Arch\u00e4ologischer Park Xanten'' is built on the site of the Roman town, and it is one of the most frequently visited parks in Germany. In 2012, the Archaeological Park was expanded to nearly the whole area of the Roman colonia after Bundesstra\u00dfe 57 was moved away from the area.\n\nHistorical buildings in the town centre have been restored. At the ''Xantener S\u00fcdsee'' and ''Xantener Nordsee'', two lakes connected by a channel close to the localities Wardt and Vynen, the ''Freizeitzentrum Xanten'' (Xanten Leisure Center) was established in 1982. Today, it is a popular destination for sailors.\n\n==Culture==\nBig events include the ''Xantener Sommerfestspiele'' (a prestigious classical music festival lasting two weeks every summer from 1993 to 2012), the annual ''KleinMontMartre'' where artists from all over the world show their latest works as well as the annual German sandcastle-building championship.\n\n==Education==\nAmong other schools there is one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (grammar school), the ''Stiftsgymnasium Xanten'', and a private school for girls, the ''Marienschule'', in Xanten.\n\n==Governance==\n===Council===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Seat distribution in the town council after the elections 2014\n|-\n| Party|| Number of seats \n|-\n| [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] ||16\n|-\n|[[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]] || 8\n|-\n|Local initiative || 5\n|-\n|[[Alliance '90/The Greens]] || 3\n|-\n|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || 1\n|-\n|[[Left-wing politics|The Left]] || 1\n|-\n|BBX || 2\n|}\n\n===Town twinning===\nXanten is twinned with [[Geel]] in Belgium, [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] in France, [[Salisbury]] in the United Kingdom and [[Beit Sahour]] in the Palestinian National Authority.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Johannes Janssen.jpg|thumb|150px|Johannes Janssen in his later years]]\n\nThe following persons were born in Xanten or in the local boroughs of Xanten:\n* c. 1075, [[Norbert of Xanten]] (died 1134), Catholic bishop and founder of the [[Premonstratensians]]\n* 1230, [[Gottfried Hagen]] (died 1299), Cologne city writer\n* 1794, [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]] (died 1866), botanist\n* 1828, [[Georg Bleibtreu]] (died 1892), battle painter\n* 1829, [[Johannes Janssen]] (died 1891), historian\n* 1935, [[Reinhart Maurer]], philosopher\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{ill|Julius Aronius|de}}, \"Regesten\", p.&nbsp;89, No. 188; p.&nbsp;92, No. 195).

While much is unknown about the spies, documents  from the mid 19th century (1840-1845) show that the spies made weekly reports for the local police. These reports were shared with individuals as powerful as the [[Sultan]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Spies were also assigned to surveil barber shops, [[Mosque|mosques]], private baths, and hotel rooms.<ref name=\":22\" /> But because coffeehouses were key locations for discourse and information exchange, the majority of spy reports included these types of conversations.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main objective of the spies was to collect public opinion, including everything from neighborhood gossip to planned political riots.<ref name=\":22\" />  These reports were not used to persecute individuals or accuse them of crimes. Instead, the reports constituted a form of micro [[surveillance]] where the government could quickly gather a range of public opinion on an different topics.\nhello\n\n==Protestantism and temperance==\n[[File:Cyrus Hamlin (2).jpg|thumb|upright=.8|[[Cyrus Hamlin]], co-founder of [[Robert College]] in [[Istanbul]]]]\nIn the 19th century Protestant missionaries set up several schools in the Ottoman Empire, including one in [[Istanbul]] that would later become [[Robert College]]. [[Cyrus Hamlin]], who was President of the College until 1877 wrote: \"Steam made Constantinople a commercial city and brought civilization, the arts and the vices of the West and East together in the Ottoman capital\". He felt values were Christian rather than \"Western\" and both he and his successor [[George Washburn (educator)|George Washburn]] supported [[Temperance movement|temperance]] in the Ottoman Empire. According to Mary Neuberger, \"This inculcation of the Protestant work ethic was part of a more general assault on Balkan drunkenness and idleness.\" She writes that \"many British and Americans writings celebrated the coffeehouse and even smoking as acceptable and regenerative forms of leisure, a sober foil to the drunken Balkan kr\u016dchma\" and that \"the kafene was a presumed improvement for drunken and 'subjugated' Christian men.\"<ref name=neuberger>{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press| last = Mary C.

She has written that some Greek writers \"tend to underestimate the Ottoman element in smyrneika\", explaining that \"The nationalist point of view in Greek writing on music which stresses the domestic origins of cultural, political and social factors can be called [[hellenocentrism]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 48| issue = 1| pages = 1\u201325| last = Pennanen| first=Risto Pekka |title = The Nationalization of Ottoman Popular Music in Greece| journal = Ethnomusicology| date = 2004| jstor = 30046238}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison with European coffeehouses==\n[[Coffee]] and [[tobacco]] were common to both European and Ottoman coffeehouses, but they also had some differences. Unlike the English and French coffeehouses, Ottoman coffeehouses did not serve alcohol or meals, and were not patronized by women. Some authors have written that \"when a young man gazed through the window of a coffeehouse, he was aspriring to adulthood, and his admission to the institution was a communally recognized transition to adult life\". Western European coffeehouses were also \"masculine spaces\", but women would sometimes go to coffeehouses despite social conventions, because no formal rules prohibited their attendance. Though women's participation in coffeehouse culture was not socially acceptable at first, it gradually became more acceptable in Western Europe throughout the 19th century. The traditional culture endured at Ottoman coffeehouses until the introduction of \"caf\u00e9s' in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-7190-8969-5| last1 = Borsay| first1 = Peter| last2 = Furn\u00e9e| first2 = Jan Hein| title = Leisure Cultures in Urban Europe, C. 1700-1870: A Transnational Perspective| date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\nBeeley, Brian W. \u201cThe Turkish Village Coffeehouse as a Social Institution.\u201d ''Geographical Review'' 60, no. 4 (1970): 475\u201393. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/213769</nowiki>.\n\nBrummett, Palmira.

Without modern forms of communication and the limited accessibility of print news, coffeehouses enabled citizens to verbally update one another on news.<ref name=\":4\" /> News was often broken in these shops and political rumors started.<ref name=\":5\" /> Speculative conversations discussed cabinet changes, corruption scandals, and possibly initiations of war.<ref name=\":7\" /> In addition to information exchange, mutinies, coups, and other acts of political resistance were planned in coffeehouses. In particular, impassioned [[janissaries]] made coffeehouses their headquarters for meetings and discussions about political acts.<ref name=\":22\" /> Some janissaries even had their own coffeehouses which they marked with their insignia, the orta.<ref name=\":7\" /> Non-janissaries and janissaries would come together in these coffeehouses to plan rebellions to check the power of the Sultan and prevent absolutism.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> As hubs of discussion on the state, coffeehouses were opposed by the Ottoman government. They believed coffeehouses were locations of vice and disorder.<ref name=\":3\" /> Despite their efforts to burn or ban coffeehouses, these establishments persisted in popularity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Surveillance in coffeehouses ==\nThe Ottoman government was interested in coffeehouses, and they employed spies to visit them and collect public sentiment.<ref name=\":6\" /> These spies were often locals or recruited coffeehouse owners that answered to the police. While much is unknown about the spies, documents  from the mid 19th century (1840-1845) show that the spies made weekly reports for the local police. These reports were shared with individuals as powerful as the [[Sultan]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Spies were also assigned to surveil barber shops, [[Mosque|mosques]], private baths, and hotel rooms.<ref name=\":22\" /> But because coffeehouses were key locations for discourse and information exchange, the majority of spy reports included these types of conversations.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main objective of the spies was to collect public opinion, including everything from neighborhood gossip to planned political riots.<ref name=\":22\" />  These reports were not used to persecute individuals or accuse them of crimes. Instead, the reports constituted a form of micro [[surveillance]] where the government could quickly gather a range of public opinion on an different topics.\n\n==Protestantism and temperance==\n[[File:Cyrus Hamlin (2).jpg|thumb|upright=.8|[[Cyrus Hamlin]], co-founder of [[Robert College]] in [[Istanbul]]]]\nIn the 19th century Protestant missionaries set up several schools in the Ottoman Empire, including one in [[Istanbul]] that would later become [[Robert College]]. [[Cyrus Hamlin]], who was President of the College until 1877 wrote: \"Steam made Constantinople a commercial city and brought civilization, the arts and the vices of the West and East together in the Ottoman capital\". He felt values were Christian rather than \"Western\" and both he and his successor [[George Washburn (educator)|George Washburn]] supported [[Temperance movement|temperance]] in the Ottoman Empire. According to Mary Neuberger, \"This inculcation of the Protestant work ethic was part of a more general assault on Balkan drunkenness and idleness.\" She writes that \"many British and Americans writings celebrated the coffeehouse and even smoking as acceptable and regenerative forms of leisure, a sober foil to the drunken Balkan kr\u016dchma\" and that \"the kafene was a presumed improvement for drunken and 'subjugated' Christian men.\"<ref name=neuberger>{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press| last = Mary C.

She has written that some Greek writers \"tend to underestimate the Ottoman element in smyrneika\", explaining that \"The nationalist point of view in Greek writing on music which stresses the domestic origins of cultural, political and social factors can be called [[hellenocentrism]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 48| issue = 1| pages = 1\u201325| last = Pennanen| first=Risto Pekka |title = The Nationalization of Ottoman Popular Music in Greece| journal = Ethnomusicology| date = 2004| jstor = 30046238}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison with European coffeehouses==\n[[Coffee]] and [[tobacco]] were common to both European and Ottoman coffeehouses, but they also had some differences. Unlike the English and French coffeehouses, Ottoman coffeehouses did not serve alcohol or meals, and were not patronized by women. Some authors have written that \"when a young man gazed through the window of a coffeehouse, he was aspriring to adulthood, and his admission to the institution was a communally recognized transition to adult life\". Western European coffeehouses were also \"masculine spaces\", but women would sometimes go to coffeehouses despite social conventions, because no formal rules prohibited their attendance. Though women's participation in coffeehouse culture was not socially acceptable at first, it gradually became more acceptable in Western Europe throughout the 19th century. The traditional culture endured at Ottoman coffeehouses until the introduction of \"caf\u00e9s' in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-7190-8969-5| last1 = Borsay| first1 = Peter| last2 = Furn\u00e9e| first2 = Jan Hein| title = Leisure Cultures in Urban Europe, C. 1700-1870: A Transnational Perspective| date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\nBeeley, Brian W. \u201cThe Turkish Village Coffeehouse as a Social Institution.\u201d ''Geographical Review'' 60, no. 4 (1970): 475\u201393. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2307/213769</nowiki>.\n\nBrummett, Palmira.

''Ioannis Ganassos'' assisted Eugenia Manolidou in writing the lyrics.\n* '''2003 to 2009 \u2013 ''Hercules: The real face of the great hero'', ''Alexander the Great: The living legend'', ''Iliad-Odyssey''''': A series of educational recordings for children with her husband depicting Greek history and mythology as fairytales with the use of music, narration and sound effects.\n\n==TV career==\nFollowing her grand approval in 2008 Beijing Olympic Concert Eugenia Manolidou decided to start a TV career. She was originally supposed to participate either as a judge for the 1st season of [[The X Factor (Greek TV series)]] or as the hostess of the legendary morning show ''\u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2'' i.e. \"Morning Coffee\". However the broadcasting channel [[ANT1]] thought it would be more intriguing for her to be hostess of the Greek version of [[The Moment of Truth (U.S. game show)]] reality show.\n\nThey turned to be right as ''Moment of Truth'' in 2009 made a huge impact on Greek audience and caused a lot of debate on how moral is for such programmes to be televised. As a matter of fact, political rivals of Eugenia's husband, Adonis Georgiades, took advantage of her media inexperience aiming at her and Adonis' ethics. Consequently, the National Radio & Television Broadcasting Council after the end of 1st season, disallowed the show to carry on for a 2nd one. There is a major percentage of civilians criticizing her personality since then.\n\nIn first semester of 2010 Eugenia came back participating in 2 shows. She was the female judge of ''[[Ellada Eheis Talento (season 3)]] (Greece Got Talent)'' along with male judges [[Ilias Psinakis]] and ''Vangelis Perris''. The host of the show was ''Hristos Ferentinos''. Her different point of view on what is considered to be a talent, resulted in numerous arguments between the judges and heavy criticism from TV critics. In the end, it proved to be the most successful season of the show.\n\nAt the same time, Eugenia competed in the ''1st season of [[Dancing with the Stars (Greek TV series)]]'' with pro-partner ''Elias Ladas''. The intriguing part there was that she had to compete with ''Matthildi Maggira'' who replaced in ''Greece Got Talent''. She performed remarkably well, gaining audience's interest. Eugenia and Elias eventually got eliminated in the semi-final (3rd place). There were rumors that she was denied final spot because she had already signed for her next step with rival TV channel [[Mega Channel]]. After 5 seasons of ''Dancing With The Stars'' in Greece, Eugenia is still considered to be in top-5 overall contestants, with several guest appearances in the show.\n\nSo, in second semester of 2010, Eugenia Manolidou presented the ''1st season of cooking show [[MasterChef Greece]]'' broadcast from [[Mega Channel]], an adaptation of the original [[MasterChef (UK TV series)]] BBC show. The 3 judges were chefs [[Lefteris Lazarou]], ''Giannis Loukakos'' and ''Dimitris Skarmoutsos''. Although many predicted failure, ''MasterChef'' proved to be the most successful cooking show ever in Greek TV. Anticipation for next episode grew larger and larger and the Big Final on December 28, 2010 has been an audience's measurement milestone. \"\"Master Chef\"\" was declared contestant ''[[Akis Petretzikis]]'' and he remains unique since 2nd season of [[MasterChef Greece]] never ended. Eugenia's spontaneous reaction on winner announcement was never cut on editing and thus an urban slogan emerged: ''\u0398\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03c9'' i.e. ''I am about to collapse''. She opted not to present either Junior version or 2nd season despite proposals for both.\n\nIn 2011, Eugenia returned to \"\"ANT1\" for the ''4th season of Greece Got Talent'', but due to financial reasons, the show was postponed for the next year. Meanwhile, she accepted to present ''Dancing With the Stars Daily'', a programme based upon [[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two]] from BBC that followed action of ''2nd season of [[Dancing with the Stars (Greek TV series)]]''. ''DWTS Daily'' eventually embedded in morning infotainment programme of ANT1.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Ellada Eheis Talento (season 4)]]'' was finally aired and Eugenia kept her position as the female judge. Unlike her, [[Ilias Psinakis]] could not return and ''Haris Hristopoulos'' took his place. There were not any arguments except some nasty contestants and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It was the final edition of the show till now as well as Eugenia's most recent job on TV.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170629195058/http://www.eugeniamanolides.com/ EugeniaManolides.com]\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/pvcrs/2015/manolidou Eugenia Manolidou | Practitioners' Voices in Classical Reception Studies | Open University]\n* {{IMDb name|3360833}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manolidou, Eugenia}}\n[[Category:1975 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century classical composers]]\n[[Category:21st-century classical composers]]\n[[Category:20th-century conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:21st-century conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:20th-century Greek musicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century Greek musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Greek women]]\n[[Category:21st-century Greek women]]\n[[Category:20th-century women musicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century women musicians]]\n[[Category:Greek classical composers]]\n[[Category:Greek conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Greek female classical composers]]\n[[Category:Greek female composers]]\n[[Category:Greek female musicians]]\n[[Category:Greek television presenters]]\n[[Category:Juilliard School alumni]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Athens]]\n[[Category:Spouses of Greek politicians]]\n[[Category:Women conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Women television personalities]]\n[[Category:Women television presenters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name        = Eugenia Manolidou\n| image       =\n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| birth_name  = Eugenia Karagiannidou\n| birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|1975|02|27}}\n| birth_place = [[Athens, Greece]]\n| death_place = \n| nationality = [[Greece|Greek]]\n| other_names = Eugenia Manolidou, Eugenia Manolides\n| occupation  = [[Composer]] and [[Conducting|conductor]], entertainment [[television presenter]]\n| known_for   = \n}}\n'''Eugenia Karagiannidou''' ({{lang-el|\u0395\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5}}), better known as '''Eugenia Manolidou''' (\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5) or '''Manolides''', is a Greek classical [[composer]], [[Conducting|conductor]], entertainment [[television presenter]] and the wife of politician and Minister for Development and Investment [[Adonis Georgiadis]].\n\n==Personal life==\nBorn on February 27, 1975 as Eugenia Karagiannidou in Athens, Greece.

It was recorded in 2005 in Athens with members of ''Athens State Orchestra'', soprano ''Hara Kefala'', tenor ''Konstantinos Paliatsaras'', bass-baritone ''Tassos Apostolou'', alto ''Nona Voudouri'', baritone ''Theodoros Efstratiades'', narrator ''George Spanopoulos'' and ''Polymnia'' vocalis as chorus. ''Ioannis Ganassos'' assisted Eugenia Manolidou in writing the lyrics.\n* '''2003 to 2009 \u2013 ''Hercules: The real face of the great hero'', ''Alexander the Great: The living legend'', ''Iliad-Odyssey''''': A series of educational recordings for children with her husband depicting Greek history and mythology as fairytales with the use of music, narration and sound effects.\n\n==TV career==\nFollowing her grand approval in 2008 Beijing Olympic Concert Eugenia Manolidou decided to start a TV career. She was originally supposed to participate either as a judge for the 1st season of [[The X Factor (Greek TV series)]] or as the hostess of the legendary morning show ''\u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2'' i.e. \"Morning Coffee\". However the broadcasting channel [[ANT1]] thought it would be more intriguing for her to be hostess of the Greek version of [[The Moment of Truth (U.S. game show)]] reality show.\n\nThey turned to be right as ''Moment of Truth'' in 2009 made a huge impact on Greek audience and caused a lot of debate on how moral is for such programmes to be televised. As a matter of fact, political rivals of Eugenia's husband, Adonis Georgiades, took advantage of her media inexperience aiming at her and Adonis' ethics. Consequently, the National Radio & Television Broadcasting Council after the end of 1st season, disallowed the show to carry on for a 2nd one. There is a major percentage of civilians criticizing her personality since then.\n\nIn first semester of 2010 Eugenia came back participating in 2 shows. She was the female judge of ''[[Ellada Eheis Talento (season 3)]] (Greece Got Talent)'' along with male judges [[Ilias Psinakis]] and ''Vangelis Perris''. The host of the show was ''Hristos Ferentinos''. Her different point of view on what is considered to be a talent, resulted in numerous arguments between the judges and heavy criticism from TV critics. In the end, it proved to be the most successful season of the show.\n\nAt the same time, Eugenia competed in the ''1st season of [[Dancing with the Stars (Greek TV series)]]'' with pro-partner ''Elias Ladas''. The intriguing part there was that she had to compete with ''Matthildi Maggira'' who replaced in ''Greece Got Talent''. She performed remarkably well, gaining audience's interest. Eugenia and Elias eventually got eliminated in the semi-final (3rd place). There were rumors that she was denied final spot because she had already signed for her next step with rival TV channel [[Mega Channel]]. After 5 seasons of ''Dancing With The Stars'' in Greece, Eugenia is still considered to be in top-5 overall contestants, with several guest appearances in the show.\n\nSo, in second semester of 2010, Eugenia Manolidou presented the ''1st season of cooking show [[MasterChef Greece]]'' broadcast from [[Mega Channel]], an adaptation of the original [[MasterChef (UK TV series)]] BBC show. The 3 judges were chefs [[Lefteris Lazarou]], ''Giannis Loukakos'' and ''Dimitris Skarmoutsos''. Although many predicted failure, ''MasterChef'' proved to be the most successful cooking show ever in Greek TV. Anticipation for next episode grew larger and larger and the Big Final on December 28, 2010 has been an audience's measurement milestone. \"\"Master Chef\"\" was declared contestant ''[[Akis Petretzikis]]'' and he remains unique since 2nd season of [[MasterChef Greece]] never ended. Eugenia's spontaneous reaction on winner announcement was never cut on editing and thus an urban slogan emerged: ''\u0398\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03c9'' i.e. ''I am about to collapse''. She opted not to present either Junior version or 2nd season despite proposals for both.\n\nIn 2011, Eugenia returned to \"\"ANT1\" for the ''4th season of Greece Got Talent'', but due to financial reasons, the show was postponed for the next year. Meanwhile, she accepted to present ''Dancing With the Stars Daily'', a programme based upon [[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two]] from BBC that followed action of ''2nd season of [[Dancing with the Stars (Greek TV series)]]''. ''DWTS Daily'' eventually embedded in morning infotainment programme of ANT1.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Ellada Eheis Talento (season 4)]]'' was finally aired and Eugenia kept her position as the female judge. Unlike her, [[Ilias Psinakis]] could not return and ''Haris Hristopoulos'' took his place. There were not any arguments except some nasty contestants and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It was the final edition of the show till now as well as Eugenia's most recent job on TV.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170629195058/http://www.eugeniamanolides.com/ EugeniaManolides.com]\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/pvcrs/2015/manolidou Eugenia Manolidou | Practitioners' Voices in Classical Reception Studies | Open University]\n* {{IMDb name|3360833}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manolidou, Eugenia}}\n[[Category:1975 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century classical composers]]\n[[Category:21st-century classical composers]]\n[[Category:20th-century conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:21st-century conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:20th-century Greek musicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century Greek musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Greek women]]\n[[Category:21st-century Greek women]]\n[[Category:20th-century women musicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century women musicians]]\n[[Category:Greek classical composers]]\n[[Category:Greek conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Greek female classical composers]]\n[[Category:Greek female composers]]\n[[Category:Greek female musicians]]\n[[Category:Greek television presenters]]\n[[Category:Juilliard School alumni]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Athens]]\n[[Category:Spouses of Greek politicians]]\n[[Category:Women conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Women television personalities]]\n[[Category:Women television presenters]]\n", "name_user": "SucreRouge", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e{{Infobox person", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenia_Manolidou"}
