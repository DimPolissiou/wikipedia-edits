The gas emerging from the \"hot\" end can reach temperatures of 200 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]&nbsp;(392 [[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]]), and the gas emerging from the \"cold end\" can reach {{convert|\u221250|C|F}}.<ref name=\"Circus\">{{Cite book|title = The Flying Circus of Physics|work = |last = Walker|first = Jearl|publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year = 1975|isbn = 0-471-91808-3|page = [https://archive.org/details/flyingcircusofph0000walk_u4t8/page/97 97]|chapter = The madness of stirring tea|url = https://archive.org/details/flyingcircusofph0000walk_u4t8/page/97}}</ref> It has no [[moving parts]].\n\nPressurised gas is injected tangentially into a ''swirl chamber'' and [[acceleration|accelerated]] to a high rate of [[rotation]]. Due to the [[cone (geometry)|conical]] [[nozzle]] at the end of the tube, only the outer shell of the compressed gas is allowed to escape at that end. The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex.\n\n== Method of operation ==\n\nTo explain the temperature separation in a vortex tube, there are two main approaches:\n\n=== Fundamental approach: the physics  ===\n\nThis approach is based on first-principles physics alone and is not limited to vortex tubes only, but applies to moving gas in general. It shows that temperature separation in a moving gas is due only to enthalpy conservation in a moving frame of reference.\n\nThe thermal process in the vortex tube can be estimated in the following way: 1) The adiabatic expansion of the incoming gas, which cools the gas and turns its heat content into the kinetic energy of rotation. The total enthalpy, which is the sum of the [[enthalpy]] and the kinetic energy, is conserved. 2) The peripheric rotating gas flow moves towards the hot outlet. Here the [[Recuperator|heat recuperation]] effect takes place between the quickly rotating peripheric flow and the opposite slowly rotating axial flow. Here the heat transfers from axial flow to the peripheric one. 3) The kinetic energy of rotation turns into the heat by the means of the viscous dissipation. The temperature of the gas rises. As the total enthalpy has been increased during the heat recuperation process, this temperature is higher than the incoming gas. 4) Some of the hot gas leaves the hot outlet, carrying away the excess heat. 5) The rest of the gas turns towards the cold outlet. As it passes its way to the cold outlet, its heat energy is transferred to the peripheric flow. Although the temperature at the axis and at the periphery is about the same everywhere, the rotation is slower at the axis, so the total enthalpy is lower as well. 6) The low total enthalpy cooled gas from the axial flow leaves the cold outlet.\n\nThe main physical phenomenon of the vortex tube is the temperature separation between the cold vortex core and the warm vortex periphery. The \"vortex tube effect\" is fully explained with the work equation of Euler,<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node91.html] - Z.S. Spakovszky. Unified: thermodynamics and propulsion (Lecture notes), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. 2007. ch. 12.3.</ref> also known as Euler's turbine equation, which can be written in its most general vectorial form as:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = Jeliazko G. | last2 = Straatman | first2 = Anthony G. | year = 2012| title = Thermodynamics of angular propulsion in fluids | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 054504-1\u2013054504-4 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.054504 | bibcode=2012PhRvL.109e4504P | pmid=23006180}}</ref>\n\n:<math> T - \\frac{ \\vec v \\cdot \\vec \\omega \\times  \\vec r}{c_p}=\\mbox{const} </math>,\n\nwhere <math> T </math> is the total, or [[stagnation temperature]] of the rotating gas at radial position <math>\\vec r</math>, the absolute gas velocity as observed from the stationary frame of reference is denoted with <math>\\vec v</math>; the angular velocity of the system is <math>\\vec \\omega </math> and <math> c_p </math> is the isobaric heat capacity of the gas. This equation was published in 2012; it explains the fundamental operating principle of vortex tubes. The search for this explanation began in 1933 when the vortex tube was discovered and continued for more than 80 years.\n\nThe above equation is valid for an adiabatic turbine passage; it clearly shows that while gas moving towards the center is getting colder the peripheral gas in the passage is \"getting faster\". Therefore, vortex cooling is due to angular propulsion. The more the gas cools by reaching the center, the more rotational energy it delivers to the vortex and thus the vortex rotates even faster. This explanation stems directly from the law of energy conservation. Compressed gas at room temperature is expanded in order to gain speed through a nozzle; it then climbs the centrifugal barrier of rotation during which energy is also lost. The lost energy is delivered to the vortex, which speeds its rotation. In a vortex tube, the cylindrical surrounding wall confines the flow at periphery and thus forces conversion of kinetic into internal energy, which produces hot air at the hot exit.\n\nTherefore, the vortex tube is a rotorless [[turboexpander]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = Jeliazko G. | last2 =  Straatman | first2 = Anthony G. | year = 2015 | title = Vortex tube effect without walls | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Physics | volume = 93| issue = 8| pages = 850\u2013854| doi = 10.1139/cjp-2014-0227 | bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..850P}}</ref> It consists of a rotorless radial inflow turbine (cold end, center) and a rotorless centrifugal compressor (hot end, periphery). The work output of the turbine is converted into heat by the compressor at the hot end.\n\n=== Phenomenological approach ===\nThis approach relies on observation and experimental data. It is specifically tailored to the geometrical shape of the vortex tube and the details of its flow and is designed to match the particular observables of the complex vortex tube flow, namely turbulence, acoustic phenomena, pressure fields, air velocities and many others. The earlier published models of the vortex tube are phenomenological. They are:\n\n# Radial pressure difference: centrifugal compression and air expansion\n# Radial transfer of angular momentum\n# Radial acoustic streaming of energy\n# Radial heat pumping\n\nMore on these models can be found in recent review articles on vortex tubes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xue | first1 = Y. |display-authors=etal | year = 2010 | title = A critical review of temperature separation in a vortex tube | journal = Exper.

Phenomenological studies of the vortex tube in the past have been useful in presenting empirical data. However, due to the complexity of the vortex flow this empirical approach was able to show only aspects of the effect but was unable to explain its operating principle. Dedicated to empirical details, for a long time the empirical studies made the vortex tube effect appear enigmatic and its explanation \u2013 a matter of debate.\n\n==History==\nThe vortex tube was invented in 1931 by French physicist [[Georges J.

With no moving parts, no electricity, and no refrigerant, a vortex tube can produce refrigeration up to {{convert|6000|BTU/h|abbr=on}} using only filtered compressed air at 100 PSI (6.9 bar).

The vortex tube is well-matched to this application: machine shops generally already use compressed air, and  a fast jet of cold air provides both cooling and removal of the \"chips\" produced by the tool. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the need for liquid coolant, which is messy, expensive, and environmentally hazardous.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Helikon vortex separation process]]\n* [[Maxwell's demon]]\n* [[Windhexe]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*G.

The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex.\n\n== Method of operation ==\n\nTo explain the temperature separation in a vortex tube, there are two main approaches:\n\n=== Fundamental approach: the physics  ===\n\nThis approach is based on first-principles physics alone and is not limited to vortex tubes only, but applies to moving gas in general. It shows that temperature separation in a moving gas is due only to enthalpy conservation in a moving frame of reference.\n\nThe thermal process in the vortex tube can be estimated in the following way: 1) The adiabatic expansion of the incoming gas, which cools the gas and turns its heat content into the kinetic energy of rotation. The total enthalpy, which is the sum of the [[enthalpy]] and the kinetic energy, is conserved. 2) The peripheric rotating gas flow moves towards the hot outlet. Here the [[Recuperator|heat recuperation]] effect takes place between the quickly rotating peripheric flow and the opposite slowly rotating axial flow. Here the heat transfers from axial flow to the peripheric one. 3) The kinetic energy of rotation turns into the heat by the means of the viscous dissipation. The temperature of the gas rises. As the total enthalpy has been increased during the heat recuperation process, this temperature is higher than the incoming gas. 4) Some of the hot gas leaves the hot outlet, carrying away the excess heat. 5) The rest of the gas turns towards the cold outlet. As it passes its way to the cold outlet, its heat energy is transferred to the peripheric flow. Although the temperature at the axis and at the periphery is about the same everywhere, the rotation is slower at the axis, so the total enthalpy is lower as well. 6) The low total enthalpy cooled gas from the axial flow leaves the cold outlet.\n\nThe main physical phenomenon of the vortex tube is the temperature separation between the cold vortex core and the warm vortex periphery. The \"vortex tube effect\" is fully explained with the work equation of Euler,<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node91.html] - Z.S. Spakovszky. Unified: thermodynamics and propulsion (Lecture notes), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. 2007. ch. 12.3.</ref> also known as Euler's turbine equation, which can be written in its most general vectorial form as:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = Jeliazko G. | last2 = Straatman | first2 = Anthony G. | year = 2012| title = Thermodynamics of angular propulsion in fluids | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 054504-1\u2013054504-4 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.054504 | bibcode=2012PhRvL.109e4504P | pmid=23006180}}</ref>\n\n:<math> T - \\frac{ \\vec v \\cdot \\vec \\omega \\times  \\vec r}{c_p}=\\mbox{const} </math>,\n\nwhere <math> T </math> is the total, or [[stagnation temperature]] of the rotating gas at radial position <math>\\vec r</math>, the absolute gas velocity as observed from the stationary frame of reference is denoted with <math>\\vec v</math>; the angular velocity of the system is <math>\\vec \\omega </math> and <math> c_p </math> is the isobaric heat capacity of the gas. This equation was published in 2012; it explains the fundamental operating principle of vortex tubes. The search for this explanation began in 1933 when the vortex tube was discovered and continued for more than 80 years.\n\nThe above equation is valid for an adiabatic turbine passage; it clearly shows that while gas moving towards the center is getting colder the peripheral gas in the passage is \"getting faster\". Therefore, vortex cooling is due to angular propulsion. The more the gas cools by reaching the center, the more rotational energy it delivers to the vortex and thus the vortex rotates even faster. This explanation stems directly from the law of energy conservation. Compressed gas at room temperature is expanded in order to gain speed through a nozzle; it then climbs the centrifugal barrier of rotation during which energy is also lost. The lost energy is delivered to the vortex, which speeds its rotation. In a vortex tube, the cylindrical surrounding wall confines the flow at periphery and thus forces conversion of kinetic into internal energy, which produces hot air at the hot exit.\n\nTherefore, the vortex tube is a rotorless [[turboexpander]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = Jeliazko G. | last2 =  Straatman | first2 = Anthony G. | year = 2015 | title = Vortex tube effect without walls | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Physics | volume = 93| issue = 8| pages = 850\u2013854| doi = 10.1139/cjp-2014-0227 | bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..850P}}</ref> It consists of a rotorless radial inflow turbine (cold end, center) and a rotorless centrifugal compressor (hot end, periphery). The work output of the turbine is converted into heat by the compressor at the hot end.\n\n=== Phenomenological approach ===\nThis approach relies on observation and experimental data. It is specifically tailored to the geometrical shape of the vortex tube and the details of its flow and is designed to match the particular observables of the complex vortex tube flow, namely turbulence, acoustic phenomena, pressure fields, air velocities and many others. The earlier published models of the vortex tube are phenomenological. They are:\n\n# Radial pressure difference: centrifugal compression and air expansion\n# Radial transfer of angular momentum\n# Radial acoustic streaming of energy\n# Radial heat pumping\n\nMore on these models can be found in recent review articles on vortex tubes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xue | first1 = Y. |display-authors=etal | year = 2010 | title = A critical review of temperature separation in a vortex tube | journal = Exper.

Phenomenological studies of the vortex tube in the past have been useful in presenting empirical data. However, due to the complexity of the vortex flow this empirical approach was able to show only aspects of the effect but was unable to explain its operating principle. Dedicated to empirical details, for a long time the empirical studies made the vortex tube effect appear enigmatic and its explanation \u2013 a matter of debate.\n\n==History==\nThe vortex tube was invented in 1931 by French physicist [[Georges J.

With no moving parts, no electricity, and no refrigerant, a vortex tube can produce refrigeration up to {{convert|6000|BTU/h|abbr=on}} using only filtered compressed air at 100 PSI (6.9 bar).

The vortex tube is well-matched to this application: machine shops generally already use compressed air, and  a fast jet of cold air provides both cooling and removal of the \"chips\" produced by the tool. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the need for liquid coolant, which is messy, expensive, and environmentally hazardous.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Helikon vortex separation process]]\n* [[Maxwell's demon]]\n* [[Windhexe]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*G.

The name of the facility is an acronym for '''I'''sotope '''S'''eparator '''O'''n '''L'''ine '''DE'''vice.<ref name=\"isolde-web-history\">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://isolde.web.cern.ch/history |website=ISOLDE The Radioactive Ion Beam Facility |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Created in 1964, the ISOLDE facility started delivering radioactive ion beams to users in 1967. Originally located at the [[Synchro-Cyclotron (CERN)|SynchroCyclotron accelerator]] (CERN's first ever particle accelerator), the facility has been upgraded several times most notably in 1992 when the whole facility was moved to be connected to CERN's [[Proton Synchrotron|ProtonSynchroton Booster]] (PSB). Entering its 6th decade of existence, ISOLDE is currently the oldest facility still in operation at CERN. From the first pioneering ISOL beams to the latest technical advances allowing for the production of the most exotic species, ISOLDE benefits a wide range of physics communities with applications covering nuclear, atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, but also biophysics and astrophysics, as well as high-precision experiments looking for physics beyond the Standard Model. The facility is operated by the ISOLDE Collaboration, comprising CERN and fifteen (mostly) European countries. As of 2019, more than 800 experimentalists around the world (including all continents) are coming to ISOLDE to perform typically 45 different experiments per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Active experiments |url=http://isolde.web.cern.ch/active-experiments |website=ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Radioactive nuclei]] are produced at ISOLDE by shooting a high-energy (1.4GeV) beam of [[protons]] delivered by CERN's PSBooster accelerator on a 20 cm thick target. Several target materials are used depending on the desired final [[isotope]]s that are requested by the experimentalists. The interaction of the proton beam with the target material produces radioactive species through [[spallation]], [[wikt:fragmentation|fragmentation]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]] reactions. They are subsequently extracted from the bulk of the target material through thermal diffusion processes by heating the target to about 2000 degrees.  The cocktail of produced isotopes is ultimately filtered using one of ISOLDE's two [[magnetic dipole]] mass separators to yield the desired isobar of interest. The time required for the extraction process to occur is dictated by the nature of the desired [[isotope]] and/or that of the target material and places a lower limit on the [[half-life]] of isotopes which can be produced by this method, and is typically of the order of a few milliseconds. Once extracted, the isotopes are directed either to one of several low-energy [[nuclear physics]] experiments or an isotope-harvesting area. An upgrade of the pre-existing REX post-accelerator, the latest addition to the ISOLDE facility is the HIE-ISOLDE [[superconducting]] linac which allows the re-acceleration of the radioisotopes to higher energies.\n\n==Background==\nThe number of [[proton]]s in a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] determine what element it belongs to: to have a neutral atom, the same number of electrons circulate around the atomic nucleus and these define the chemical properties of the element. However, a specific [[Chemical element|element]] can occur with different \u2018nuclei\u2019, each having the same number of [[proton]]s but a different number of [[neutron]]s. These variations of the element are called its [[isotope]]s. For example, three isotopes of the element [[carbon]] are called carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14; which have 6, 7, 8 neutrons respectively. The numbers added after the element name are the [[mass number]] of the isotope i.e. the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. \n\n[[File:NuclideMap stitched small preview.png|thumb|[[Table of nuclides]]]]\n\nEach isotope of an element has different stability depending on their numbers of protons and neutrons. The word nuclide is used to refer to the isotopes with respect to their stability and nuclear [[energy state]]. [[Stable nuclide]]s can be found in nature but [[Radionuclide|unstable (i.e. radioactive) ones]] cannot because they spontaneously [[Radioactive_decay|decay]] into more stable nuclides. Scientists use [[Particle_accelerator|accelerator]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s to product and examine radioactive nuclides. The neutron-to-proton ratio has a strong impact on the properties of the isotope in question. Most notably, as this ratio strongly departs from unity the isotopes usually become ever increasingly short-lived. The time required to loose half of a population of a given nuclide through radioactive decays, the called [[half-life]], is a measure of how stable an isotope is. <ref name=\"courier-7-2\" />\n\nSimilar to the periodic table of elements for atoms, nuclides are usually visually represented on a table (the so-called Segr\u00e9 chart or chart of nuclides) where the proton number is represented on the y-axis while the x-axis represents the neutron number. <ref>{{cite web |title=ISOLDE Exploring exotic nuclei |url=http://isolde.web.cern.ch/sites/isolde.web.cern.ch/files/ISOLDE_English-H_0.pdf |website=ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Isolde Excavation.jpg|thumb|Excavation of underground experimental area for ISOLDE]]\n\nIn 1950, two Danish physicists Otto Kofoed-Hansen and Karl-Ove Nielsen discovered a new technique for producing radioisotopes which enabled producing isotopes with shorter half-lives than earlier methods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kofoed-Hansen and Nielsen produce short-lived radioactive isotopes |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/kofoed-hansen-and-nielsen-produce-short-lived-radioactive-isotopes |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Ten years later, in [[Vienna]], at a symposium about separating radioisotopes, plans for an \u2018on-line\u2019 isotope separator were published. Using these plans, CERN's Nuclear Chemistry Group (NCG) built a prototype on-line mass separator coupled to target and ion source, which was bombarded by a proton beam delivered by CERN's [[Synchro-Cyclotron_(CERN)|the Synchro-Cyclotron]]. The test was a success and showed that the Synchro-Cyclotron was an appropriate machine for on-line rare isotope production.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plans for an isotope separator are published |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/plans-isotope-separator-are-published |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> In 1964, a proposal for an isotope separator on-line project was accepted by the CERN Director-General and the ISOLDE project began.<ref>{{cite web |title=CERN approves the online separator project |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/cern-approves-online-separator-project |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Finance Committee\" for the project set up with five members, then extended to 12.

In 1972 the SC shut down to upgrade its [[Particle_beam|beam]] intensity by changing its [[radiofrequency]] system. The SC improvement program increased the primary proton beam intensity by about a factor of 100. To be able to handle this high-intensity ISOLDE facility also needed some modifications. After necessary modifications, the new ISOLDE facility also known as ISOLDE 2 was launched in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plans to shut down the Synchrocyclotron |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/plans-shut-down-synchrocyclotron |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> Its new target design combined with the increased beam intensity from the SC led to significant enhancements in the number of nuclides produced.

In ISOLDE, from the production to the measurements all the processes are connected, or in other words, they're \"on-line\". Radioactive nuclides are produced by bombarding a target with protons from a particle accelerator. Then they are ionized using surface, plasma or laser ion sources before being separated according to their masses by using magnetic dipole mass separators. After producing the beam of the preferred isotope, the beam can be cooled and/or bunched to reduce the emittance and energy spreads of the beam. Then the beam is directed to either low-energy experiments or a post-accelerator to increase its energy.<ref name=\"courier-7-2\">{{cite journal |title=ISOLDE isotope separator on-line project |journal=CERN Courier |date=February 1967 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=22\u201327 |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1728851 |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Higher energies for ISOLDE's radioactive ion beams |url=http://hie-isolde-project.web.cern.ch/higher-energies-isoldes-radioactive-ion-beams |website=HIE-ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt THE ISOLDE facility, the main beam for reactions comes from the [[Proton Synchrotron]].

The other separator is called the high resolution separator (HRS) is made from two C-type dipole magnets. Their bending radii are 1m and bending angles are 90\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.

The general purpose separator sends beams to an electronic switchyard which allows scientists to conduct up to three simultaneous experiments. The high resolution separator with two magnets and beam-correcting elements, can be used for experiments that require higher mass resolution values. One branch from the GPS switchyard and HRS are connected to a common central beamline which is used to provide beam to various experimental setups dedicated to [[nuclear spectroscopy]] and [[nuclear orientation]], [[laser spectroscopy]], high-precision mass spectrometry, [[Solid-state_physics|solid-state]] and [[Surface_science#Surface_physics|surface]] studies.<ref name=\"isolde-web-tas\">{{cite web |title=Targets and Separators |url=http://isolde.web.cern.ch/targets-and-separators |website=ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional ion source units at ISOLDE are based on [[Surface_ionization|surface]] or [[Ion_source#Plasma_desorption_ionization|plasma ionization]] techniques. In addition to those techniques a laser based ion source called RILIS, which allows an element sensitive selection of isotopes, is also being used for some elements. To be able to deliver beams with higher quality and increased sensitivity an ion cooler and buncher called ISCOOL, is being used in the HRS separator. All in all, the ISOLDE facility provides 1300 isotopes from 75 elements in the periodic table.<ref name=isolde-ppf />\n\nThe project CERN-MEDICIS, which is a part of the ISOLDE facility, is running to supply radioactive isotopes for medical applications. The experiments at ISOLDE facility use about half of the protons in the beams from PS Booster. The beams preserve 90% of their intensities after hitting a standard target in the facility. CERN-MEDICIS project uses the remaining protons on a target that is placed behind the HRS target to produce radioisotopes for medical purposes. The irradiated target is then being carried to MEDICIS building by using an automated conveyor to separate and collect the isotopes of interest.<ref name=isolde-ppf />\n\nAccelerating them to higher energy levels is a good technique to be able to examine radioactive isotopes further. For this purpose, a post-accelerator called REX-ISOLDE, which accelerates the newly produced radioisotopes up to 3 MeV, is being used at ISOLDE facility. The accelerated isotopes are being directed to the target setup of a [[nuclear spectroscopy]] experiment, which includes charged-particle detectors and the MINIBALL [[gamma ray]] detector. Originally intended to accelerate light isotopes, REX-ISOLDE project has passed this goal and provided post-accelerated beams of a wider mass range, namely from <sup>6</sup>He up to <sup>224</sup>Ra. REX-ISOLDE has delivered accelerated beams of more than 100 isotopes of more than 30 elements since its commissioning.\n\nTo be able to satisfy the ever-increasing needs of higher quality, intensity, and energy of the production beam is very important for facilities such as ISOLDE. As the latest response to satisfy these needs, HIE-ISOLDE upgrade project has been started. Due to its phased planning, the upgrade project will be carried out with the least impact on the experiments continuing in the facility. The project includes an energy increase for the REX-ISOLDE up to 10 MeV as well as [[resonator]] and cooler upgrades, enhancement of the input beam from PS Booster, improvements on targets, ion sources, and mass separators. As of 2018 most of the energy upgrades, including increasing REX-ISOLDE energy to 10MeV, completed and phase two is concluded. Upgrades about intensity are planned to be done in phase three. As a state-of-the-art project, HIE-ISOLDE is expected to expand the research opportunities in ISOLDE facility to the next level. When completed, the upgraded facility will be able to host advanced experiments in fields like [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear astrophysics]].\n\n==Solid state physics laboratory==\nAttached to ISOLDE is in building 508 one of the largest solid sate physics laboratory for [[perturbed angular correlation]] that receive its major funding from [[BMBF]]. It uses about 20-25% of ISOLDE's beam time. Its major focus is the study of functional materials, such as metals, semiconductors, insulators and bio-molecules. The main use of exotic PAC-isotopes, such as <sup>111m</sup>Cd, <sup>199m</sup>Hg, <sup>204m</sup>Pb as well as transition metal isotopes are important for materials research. Because many isotopes have half-lives that are in the range of minutes and hours, experiments need to be performed on-site.

The name of the facility is an acronym for '''I'''sotope '''S'''eparator '''O'''n '''L'''ine '''DE'''vice.<ref name=\"isolde-web-history\">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://isolde.web.cern.ch/history |website=ISOLDE The Radioactive Ion Beam Facility |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Created in 1964, the ISOLDE facility started delivering radioactive ion beams to users in 1967. Originally located at the [[Synchro-Cyclotron (CERN)|SynchroCyclotron accelerator]] (CERN\u2019s first ever particle accelerator), the facility has been upgraded several times most notably in 1992 when the whole facility was moved to be connected to CERN\u2019s [[Proton Synchrotron|ProtonSynchroton Booster]] (PSB). Entering its 6th decade of existence, ISOLDE is currently the oldest facility still in operation at CERN. From the first pioneering ISOL beams to the latest technical advances allowing for the production of the most exotic species, ISOLDE benefits a wide range of physics communities with applications covering nuclear, atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, but also biophysics and astrophysics, as well as high-precision experiments looking for physics beyond the Standard Model. The facility is operated by the ISOLDE Collaboration, comprising CERN and fifteen (mostly) European countries. As of 2019, more than 800 experimentalists around the world (including all continents) are coming to ISOLDE to perform typically 45 different experiments per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Active experiments |url=http://isolde.web.cern.ch/active-experiments |website=ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Radioactive nuclei]] are produced at ISOLDE by shooting a high-energy (1.4GeV) beam of [[protons]] delivered by CERN\u2019s PSBooster accelerator on a 20 cm thick target. Several target materials are used depending on the desired final [[isotope]]s that are requested by the experimentalists. The interaction of the proton beam with the target material produces radioactive species through [[spallation]], [[wikt:fragmentation|fragmentation]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]] reactions. They are subsequently extracted from the bulk of the target material through thermal diffusion processes by heating the target to about 2000 degrees.  The cocktail of produced isotopes is ultimately filtered using one of ISOLDE\u2019s two [[magnetic dipole]] mass separators to yield the desired isobar of interest. The time required for the extraction process to occur is dictated by the nature of the desired [[isotope]] and/or that of the target material and places a lower limit on the [[half-life]] of isotopes which can be produced by this method, and is typically of the order of a few milliseconds. Once extracted, the isotopes are directed either to one of several low-energy [[nuclear physics]] experiments or an isotope-harvesting area. An upgrade of the pre-existing REX post-accelerator, the latest addition to the ISOLDE facility is the HIE-ISOLDE [[superconducting]] linac which allows the re-acceleration of the radioisotopes to higher energies.\n\n==Background==\nThe number of [[proton]]s in a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] determine what element it belongs to: to have a neutral atom, the same number of electrons circulate around the atomic nucleus and these define the chemical properties of the element. However, a specific [[Chemical element|element]] can occur with different \u2018nuclei\u2019, each having the same number of [[proton]]s but a different number of [[neutron]]s. These variations of the element are called its [[isotope]]s. For example, three isotopes of the element [[carbon]] are called carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14; which have 6, 7, 8 neutrons respectively. The numbers added after the element name are the [[mass number]] of the isotope i.e. the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. \n\n[[File:NuclideMap stitched small preview.png|thumb|[[Table of nuclides]]]]\n\nEach isotope of an element has different stability depending on their numbers of protons and neutrons. The word nuclide is used to refer to the isotopes with respect to their stability and nuclear [[energy state]]. [[Stable nuclide]]s can be found in nature but [[Radionuclide|unstable (i.e. radioactive) ones]] cannot because they spontaneously [[Radioactive_decay|decay]] into more stable nuclides. Scientists use [[Particle_accelerator|accelerator]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s to product and examine radioactive nuclides. The neutron-to-proton ratio has a strong impact on the properties of the isotope in question. Most notably, as this ratio strongly departs from unity the isotopes usually become ever increasingly short-lived. The time required to loose half of a population of a given nuclide through radioactive decays, the called [[half-life]], is a measure of how stable an isotope is. <ref name=\"courier-7-2\" />\n\nSimilar to the periodic table of elements for atoms, nuclides are usually visually represented on a table (the so-called Segr\u00e9 chart or chart of nuclides) where the proton number is represented on the y-axis while the x-axis represents the neutron number. <ref>{{cite web |title=ISOLDE Exploring exotic nuclei |url=http://isolde.web.cern.ch/sites/isolde.web.cern.ch/files/ISOLDE_English-H_0.pdf |website=ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Isolde Excavation.jpg|thumb|Excavation of underground experimental area for ISOLDE]]\n\nIn 1950, two Danish physicists Otto Kofoed-Hansen and Karl-Ove Nielsen discovered a new technique for producing radioisotopes which enabled producing isotopes with shorter half-lives than earlier methods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kofoed-Hansen and Nielsen produce short-lived radioactive isotopes |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/kofoed-hansen-and-nielsen-produce-short-lived-radioactive-isotopes |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref> Ten years later, in [[Vienna]], at a symposium about separating radioisotopes, plans for an \u2018on-line\u2019 isotope separator were published.

In 1972 the SC shut down to upgrade its [[Particle_beam|beam]] intensity by changing its [[radiofrequency]] system. The SC improvement program increased the primary proton beam intensity by about a factor of 100. To be able to handle this high-intensity ISOLDE facility also needed some modifications. After necessary modifications, the new ISOLDE facility also known as ISOLDE 2 was launched in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plans to shut down the Synchrocyclotron |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/plans-shut-down-synchrocyclotron |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> Its new target design combined with the increased beam intensity from the SC led to significant enhancements in the number of nuclides produced.

Radioactive nuclides are produced by bombarding a target with protons from a particle accelerator. Then they are ionized using surface, plasma or laser ion sources before being separated according to their masses by using magnetic dipole mass separators. After producing the beam of the preferred isotope, the beam can be cooled and/or bunched to reduce the emittance and energy spreads of the beam. Then the beam is directed to either low-energy experiments or a post-accelerator to increase its energy.<ref name=\"courier-7-2\">{{cite journal |title=ISOLDE isotope separator on-line project |journal=CERN Courier |date=February 1967 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=22\u201327 |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1728851 |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Higher energies for ISOLDE's radioactive ion beams |url=http://hie-isolde-project.web.cern.ch/higher-energies-isoldes-radioactive-ion-beams |website=HIE-ISOLDE Web |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt THE ISOLDE facility, the main beam for reactions comes from the [[Proton Synchrotron]].

In addition to those techniques a laser based ion source called RILIS, which allows an element sensitive selection of isotopes, is also being used for some elements. To be able to deliver beams with higher quality and increased sensitivity an ion cooler and buncher called ISCOOL, is being used in the HRS separator.

The experiments at ISOLDE facility use about half of the protons in the beams from PS Booster. The beams preserve 90% of their intensities after hitting a standard target in the facility. CERN-MEDICIS project uses the remaining protons on a target that is placed behind the HRS target to produce radioisotopes for medical purposes. The irradiated target is then being carried to MEDICIS building by using an automated conveyor to separate and collect the isotopes of interest.<ref name=isolde-ppf />\n\nAccelerating them to higher energy levels is a good technique to be able to examine radioactive isotopes further. For this purpose, a post-accelerator called REX-ISOLDE, which accelerates the newly produced radioisotopes up to 3 MeV, is being used at ISOLDE facility. The accelerated isotopes are being directed to the target setup of a [[nuclear spectroscopy]] experiment, which includes charged-particle detectors and the MINIBALL [[gamma ray]] detector. Originally intended to accelerate light isotopes, REX-ISOLDE project has passed this goal and provided post-accelerated beams of a wider mass range, namely from <sup>6</sup>He up to <sup>224</sup>Ra. REX-ISOLDE has delivered accelerated beams of more than 100 isotopes of more than 30 elements since its commissioning.\n\nTo be able to satisfy the ever-increasing needs of higher quality, intensity, and energy of the production beam is very important for facilities such as ISOLDE. As the latest response to satisfy these needs, HIE-ISOLDE upgrade project has been started. Due to its phased planning, the upgrade project will be carried out with the least impact on the experiments continuing in the facility. The project includes an energy increase for the REX-ISOLDE up to 10 MeV as well as [[resonator]] and cooler upgrades, enhancement of the input beam from PS Booster, improvements on targets, ion sources, and mass separators. As of 2018 most of the energy upgrades, including increasing REX-ISOLDE energy to 10MeV, completed and phase two is concluded. Upgrades about intensity are planned to be done in phase three. As a state-of-the-art project, HIE-ISOLDE is expected to expand the research opportunities in ISOLDE facility to the next level. When completed, the upgraded facility will be able to host advanced experiments in fields like [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear astrophysics]].\n\n==Solid state physics laboratory==\nAttached to ISOLDE is in building 508 one of the largest solid sate physics laboratory for [[perturbed angular correlation]] that receive its major funding from [[BMBF]]. It uses about 20-25% of ISOLDE's beam time. Its major focus is the study of functional materials, such as metals, semiconductors, insulators and bio-molecules. The main use of exotic PAC-isotopes, such as <sup>111m</sup>Cd, <sup>199m</sup>Hg, <sup>204m</sup>Pb as well as transition metal isotopes are important for materials research. Because many isotopes have half-lives that are in the range of minutes and hours, experiments need to be performed on-site. Additional methods are [[Diffusion#Tracerdiffusion|tracer diffusion]], online-[[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]] (<sup>57</sup>Mn) and [[photoluminescence]] with radioaktive nuclei.\n\n==Results and Discoveries==\nBelow is the list of some physics activities done at ISOLDE facility.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jonson |first1=Bj\u00f6rn |last2=Riisager |first2=Karsten |title=The ISOLDE facility |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/The_ISOLDE_facility |website=Scholarpedia |accessdate=12 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ISODLE Timeline |url=https://timeline.web.cern.ch/timeline-header/140 |website=Timelines |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=12 September 2019}}</ref>\n* Extension of the [[table of nuclides]] by discovering new isotopes\n* High precision measurements of nuclear masses\n* Discovery of shape staggering in light Hg isotopes\n* Production of [[Nuclear isomer|isomeric beams]]\n* Discovery of beta-delayed multi particle emission\n* Studies on nuclear resonance systems beyond the [[Nuclear drip line|dripline]]\n* Proofs of existence of nuclear halo structure\n* Synthesis of waiting-point nuclei\n* Atomic spectroscopy of [[francium]]\n* Studies on beta-neutrino correlations\n* First observations of short-lived pear-shaped atomic nuclei\n* Measurement of the mass and charge radii of exotic [[calcium]] nuclei\n* Discovery of new [[Magic_number_(chemistry)|magic number]]s and disappearance of some well established shell closures\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |title=Focus on Exotic Beams at ISOLDE: A Laboratory Portrait |journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics |date=2017 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=010301 |doi=10.1088/1361-6471/aa990f |last1=Borge |first1=Mar\u00eda J G. |last2=Blaum |first2=Klaus }}\n* {{cite journal |title=ISOLDE \u2013 a laboratory portrait |journal=Hyperfine Interactions |date=December 2000 |volume=129 |issue=1\u20134 |doi=10.1023/A:1012690327194 |url=https://link.springer.com/journal/10751/129/1/page/1 |accessdate=9 August 2019|last1=Forkel\u2010Wirth |first1=Doris |last2=Bollen |first2=Georg }}\n* {{cite web |last1=Jonson |first1=Bj\u00f6rn |last2=Riisager |first2=Karsten |title=The ISOLDE facility |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/The_ISOLDE_facility |website=Scholarpedia |accessdate=11 September 2019}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Van Duppen |first1=Piet |title=Isotope Separation On Line and Post Acceleration |journal=The Euroschool Lectures on Physics with Exotic Beams |date=2006 |volume=2 |pages=37\u201377 |doi=10.1007/3-540-33787-3_2|series=Lecture Notes in Physics |isbn=978-3-540-33786-7 |bibcode=2006LNP...700...37V }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Jonson |first1=Bj\u00f6rn |title=ISOLDE and its contributions to nuclear physics in Europe |journal=Physics Reports |date=April 1993 |volume=225 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=137\u2013155 |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(93)90165-A |bibcode=1993PhR...225..137J }}\n* {{cite journal |title=ISOLDE isotope separator on-line project |journal=CERN Courier |date=February 1967 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=22\u201327 |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1728851 |accessdate=13 September 2019}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://isolde.web.cern.ch/|ISOLDE - official website}}\n* [http://home.web.cern.ch/about/experiments/isolde ISOLDE page within CERN website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAk-9e5KQYEqdW9xuRMYPgnlz0RFsoyDK A mini documentary series about ISOLDE by CERN (YouTube playlist)]\n* [http://isolde.web.cern.ch/sites/isolde.web.cern.ch/files/ISOLDE_English-H_0.pdf A poster about ISOLDE from ISOLDE website]\n* [http://isolde.web.cern.ch/sites/isolde.web.cern.ch/files/HIE-ISOLDE-poster-Sep11-print_quality.pdf A poster about HIE-ISOLDE and some other upgrades from ISOLDE website]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Eurisol]]\n*[[Total absorption spectroscopy]]\n*[[Facility for Rare Isotope Beams]]\n*[[RAON|Rare Isotope Science Project]]\n\n{{CERN}}\n\n[[Category:Particle physics facilities]]\n[[Category:CERN facilities]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n\n\n{{particle-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Furthermore \u2192 Furthermore,, \u2019s \u2192 's (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Isotope_Mass_Separator"}
