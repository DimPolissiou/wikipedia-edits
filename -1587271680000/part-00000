When the character debuted in ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', Clarence Nash (best known as the voice of [[Donald Duck]]) provided the screeches and meows for Tom. He would continue to do so until ''Sufferin Cats'' (1943). Beginning with the short ''The Night Before Christmas'' (1941), co-creator William Hanna provided the vocal effects for the character until the last Hanna-Barbera short ''[[Tot Watchers]]'' (1958). During this time period, voice actor Harry E. Lang also did some vocal noises for Tom between 1941\u20131953. Billy Bletcher also voiced him in a few shorts between 1944\u20131947. Stepin Fetchit also voiced him in a sequence in the short ''Mouse Cleaning'' (1948). In 1961\u20131962, when [[Gene Deitch]] took over as director after the [[MGM cartoon studio]] shut down in 1957, he did vocal effects for Tom throughout that time period. When [[Chuck Jones]] took over during 1963\u20131967, he and Mel Blanc (best known for voicing [[Bugs Bunny]] and other characters) voiced Tom.\n\nIn ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975), Tom was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in ''The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show'' in 1980\u20131982. Frank Welker voiced him in ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' in 1990\u20131993. Other voice actors include Richard Kind (in ''Tom and Jerry: The Movie''), Jeff Bennett (in ''Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring''), Bill Kopp (in ''Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars'' and ''Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry''),  Spike Brandt (in ''The Karate Guard'', ''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'', ''Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse'', ''Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure'', ''Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon'', ''Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest'', and ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory''), Billy West (in ''Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes'',''Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz'', and ''Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz''), Don Brown (in ''Tom and Jerry Tales''), Alan Marriott (in ''Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry''), and Marc Silk (in ''Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers''). In ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (2014), his vocal effects are provided by show's sound designer Rich Danhakl and archival recordings of William Hanna from the original theatrical shorts.\n\n==In popular culture==\nTom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\" from the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/see-the-toons-who-would-have-appeared-in-roger-rabbits-1575259454|title=See The Toons Who Would Have Appeared In Roger Rabbit's Deleted Funeral|last=Davis|first=Lauren|date=May 12, 2014|website=io9|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tom and Jerry]]\n*[[List of Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n*[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoons}}\n{{Tom and Jerry}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n[[Category:Tom and Jerry characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic cats]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1940]]\n[[Category:MGM cartoon characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional mute characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Tomcat (disambiguation){{!}}Tomcat}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Tom\n| series             = [[Tom and Jerry]]\n| image              = Tom Tom and Jerry.png\n| caption            = Tom's design in the [[Hanna-Barbera]] shorts\n| first              = {{nowrap|''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]''}} (as Jasper) (1940)<br>{{nowrap|''[[The Midnight Snack]]''}} (as Tom) (1941)\n| creator            = [[William Hanna]]<br />[[Joseph Barbera]]\n| voice              = '''English'''<br />[[Clarence Nash]] (1940\u20131943)<br />[[Harry E.

When the character debuted in ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', Clarence Nash (best known as the voice of [[Donald Duck]]) provided the screeches and meows for Tom. He would continue to do so until ''Sufferin Cats'' (1943). Beginning with the short ''The Night Before Christmas'' (1941), co-creator William Hanna provided the vocal effects for the character until the last Hanna-Barbera short ''[[Tot Watchers]]'' (1958). During this time period, voice actor Harry E. Lang also did some vocal noises for Tom between 1941\u20131953. Billy Bletcher also voiced him in a few shorts between 1944\u20131947. Stepin Fetchit also voiced him in a sequence in the short ''Mouse Cleaning'' (1948). In 1961\u20131962, when [[Gene Deitch]] took over as director after the [[MGM cartoon studio]] shut down in 1957, he did vocal effects for Tom throughout that time period. When [[Chuck Jones]] took over during 1963\u20131967, he and Mel Blanc (best known for voicing [[Bugs Bunny]] and other characters) voiced Tom.\n\nIn ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975), Tom was voiced by John Stephenson. Lou Scheimer voiced him in ''The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show'' in 1980\u20131982. Frank Welker voiced him in ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' in 1990\u20131993. Other voice actors include Richard Kind (in ''Tom and Jerry: The Movie''), Jeff Bennett (in ''Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring''), Bill Kopp (in ''Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars'' and ''Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry''),  Spike Brandt (in ''The Karate Guard'', ''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'', ''Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse'', ''Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure'', ''Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon'', ''Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest'', and ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory''), Billy West (in ''Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes'',''Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz'', and ''Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz''), Don Brown (in ''Tom and Jerry Tales''), Alan Marriott (in ''Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry''), and Marc Silk (in ''Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers''). In ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (2014), his vocal effects are provided by show's sound designer Rich Danhakl and archival recordings of William Hanna from the original theatrical shorts.\n\n==In popular culture==\nTom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\" from the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/see-the-toons-who-would-have-appeared-in-roger-rabbits-1575259454|title=See The Toons Who Would Have Appeared In Roger Rabbit's Deleted Funeral|last=Davis|first=Lauren|date=May 12, 2014|website=io9|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tom and Jerry]]\n*[[List of Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n*[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoons}}\n{{Tom and Jerry}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n[[Category:Tom and Jerry characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic cats]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1940]]\n[[Category:MGM cartoon characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional mute characters]]\n", "name_user": "49.146.46.219", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eVoice actors)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cat"}

In the aftermath of the controversy, Dolezal was dismissed from her position as an instructor in [[Africana Studies]] at [[Eastern Washington University]] and was removed from her post as chair of the Police Ombudsman Commission in Spokane over \"a pattern of misconduct\". Later in 2015, Dolezal acknowledged that she had been \"born white to white parents\", but maintained that she self-identified as black.\n\nThe Dolezal controversy fueled a national debate in the United States about racial identity.

In the aftermath of the controversy, Dolezal was dismissed from her position as an instructor in [[Africana Studies]] at [[Eastern Washington University]] and was removed from her post as chair of the Police Ombudsman Commission in Spokane over \"a pattern of misconduct\". Later in 2015, Dolezal acknowledged that she had been \"born white to white parents\", but maintained that she self-identified as black.\n\nThe Dolezal controversy fueled a national debate in the United States about racial identity. Dolezal's critics stated that she committed [[cultural appropriation]] and fraud; Dolezal and her defenders asserted that her self-identification is genuine, even though it is not based on ancestry. In 2017, Dolezal released a memoir on her racial identity entitled ''In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World''.\n\nDolezal was charged by the State of Washington with felony [[theft]] by [[welfare fraud]] and second degree [[perjury]] in May 2018.

The publishing for this song is controlled by Memory Lane Music Group, [[Carlin America|Carlin Music Corp.]] and [[BMG Rights Management]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe song was written by producer Bob Thiele (as \"George Douglas\") and composer and performer George David Weiss.<ref name=PopHistoryDig>{{cite web|url=https://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/wonderful-world-armstrong |title=What A Wonderful World|publisher=The Pop History Dig |accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne source claims the song was first offered to [[Tony Bennett]], who turned it down,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/videos/230330900 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107105522/http://www.sundancechannel.com/videos/230330900 |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |title=Sundance Channel : Video: : SPECTACLE: Season 1 \u2013 Episode 5 (clip) |publisher=SundanceChannel.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> although Louis Armstrong biographer Ricky Riccardi disputes this claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/nolajazzmuseum/videos/947138725493034/ |title=Ricky Riccardi: Video Pops What a Wonderful World\": The First Fifty Years |accessdate=4 August 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}}</ref> George Weiss recounts in the book ''Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting'' by [[Graham Nash]] that he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong. Weiss was inspired by Armstrong's ability to bring people of different races together. \n\nBecause he was gigging at the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana Hotel]], Armstrong recorded the song in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] at [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]]\u2019s United Recording studio. The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong's midnight show, and by 2&nbsp;am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling. Arranger [[Artie Butler]] was there with songwriters Weiss and Theile, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra. Armstrong had recently signed to [[ABC Records]], and ABC president [[Larry Newton]] showed up to photograph Armstrong. Newton wanted a swingy pop song like \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with [[Kapp Records]], so when Newton heard the slow pace of \"What a Wonderful World\", he tried to stop the session. Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over. Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 [[Pay scale|musicians union scale]] for his work.<ref name=PopHistoryDig/>\n\nThe song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Singles:  Six Decades of Hot Hits & Classic Cuts|last = Black|first = Johnny|publisher = Thunder Bay Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1592236510|location = |page = 97}}</ref> but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> In the United States, the song hit No. 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|Bubbling Under]] Chart. It was also the biggest-selling single of 1968 in the UK where it was among the last pop singles issued by HMV Records before becoming an exclusive classical music label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldogproductions.info/h/hmv-pop1001-1617.html |title=45 Discography for HMV Records \u2013 UK \u2013 POP series 1001\u20131617 |publisher=Globaldogproductions.info |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> The song made Armstrong the oldest male to top the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> Armstrong's record was broken in 2009 when a remake of \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" recorded for [[Comic Relief]]\u2014which included the 68-year-old [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]\u2014reached number one in that chart. [[Tony Bennett]] did go on to record \"What A Wonderful World\" several times, as in 2003 with [[k.d. lang]], paying homage to Bennett's friend, Armstrong.\n\nABC Records' European distributor [[EMI Records|EMI]] forced ABC to issue a ''What a Wonderful World'' album in 1968 (catalogue number ABCS-650). It did not chart in the United States, due to ABC not promoting it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/abc/abc600.html |title=ABC-Paramount Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> but charted in the UK where it was issued by [[Stateside Records]] with catalogue number SSL 10247 and peaked on the British chart at No. 37.\n\nThe song gradually became something of a standard and reached a new level of popularity. In 1978, it was featured in the closing scenes of BBC radio's, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and was repeated for BBC's 1981 [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|TV adaptation of the series]]. In 1988, Armstrong's recording appeared in the film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (despite the film being set in 1965 \u2013 two years before it was recorded) and was re-released as a single, hitting No. 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in February 1988. The single charted at number one for the fortnight ending June 27, 1988 on the [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s|Australian chart]]. It is also the closing song for the 1995 movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]''.\n\nIn 2001, rappers [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Raekwon]] and [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]] released \"The Forest,\" a song that begins with three lines of lyric adapted from \"What a Wonderful World\", altered to become \"an invitation to get high\" on marijuana.<ref name=Ghostface>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 |page=22 |title=Court: Ghostface Rap Was 'Fair Use' |last=Chang |first=Samantha |work=Billboard |date=November 1, 2003 |volume=115 |issn=0006-2510 |issue=44}}</ref> The rappers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, were sued by the owners of \"What a Wonderful World,\" Abilene Music.

Weiss was inspired by Armstrong's ability to bring people of different races together. \n\nBecause he was gigging at the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana Hotel]], Armstrong recorded the song in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] at [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]]\u2019s United Recording studio. The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong's midnight show, and by 2&nbsp;am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling. Arranger [[Artie Butler]] was there with songwriters Weiss and Theile, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra. Armstrong had recently signed to [[ABC Records]], and ABC president [[Larry Newton]] showed up to photograph Armstrong. Newton wanted a swingy pop song like \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with [[Kapp Records]], so when Newton heard the slow pace of \"What a Wonderful World\", he tried to stop the session. Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over. Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 [[Pay scale|musicians union scale]] for his work.<ref name=PopHistoryDig/>\n\nThe song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Singles:  Six Decades of Hot Hits & Classic Cuts|last = Black|first = Johnny|publisher = Thunder Bay Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1592236510|location = |page = 97}}</ref> but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\"/> In the United States, the song hit No. 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|Bubbling Under]] Chart.

{"title_page": "Commitment scheme", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n\nA '''commitment scheme''' is a [[cryptographic primitive]] that allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later.<ref name=Goldreich>[[Oded Goldreich]] (2001). Foundations of Cryptography: Volume 1, Basic Tools, ([http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PSBookFrag/part2N.ps draft available] from author's site). Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-79172-3}}. (see also http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/foc-book.html) {{rp|224}}</ref> Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are ''binding''. Commitment schemes have important applications in a number of [[cryptographic protocol]]s including secure [[coin flipping#Telecommunications|coin flipping]], [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, and [[secure computation]].\n\nA way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changed&mdash;merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time.\n\nInteractions in a commitment scheme take place in two phases:\n\n# the ''commit phase'' during which a value is chosen and specified\n# the ''reveal phase'' during which the value is revealed and checked\n\nIn simple protocols, the commit phase consists of a single message from the sender to the receiver. This message is called ''the commitment''. It is essential that the specific value chosen cannot be known by the receiver at that time (this is called the ''hiding'' property). A simple reveal phase would consist of a single message, ''the opening'', from the sender to the receiver, followed by a check performed by the receiver. The value chosen during the commit phase must be the only one that the sender can compute and that validates during the reveal phase (this is called the ''binding'' property).\n\nThe concept of commitment schemes was perhaps first formalized by [[Gilles Brassard]], [[David Chaum]], and [[Claude Crepeau]] in 1988,<ref name=\"BCC\">Gilles Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crepeau, ''[http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/PDF/BCC88-jcss.pdf Minimum Disclosure Proofs of Knowledge]'', Journal of Computer and System Sciences, vol. 37, pp. 156\u2013189, 1988.</ref> as part of various Zero-Knowledge protocols for ''NP'', based on various types of commitment schemes (see also: <ref>{{cite journal |first=Oded |last=Goldreich |first2=Silvio |last2=Micali |first3=Avi |last3=Wigderson |title=Proofs that yield nothing but their validity |journal=Journal of the ACM |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=690\u2013728 |doi=10.1145/116825.116852 |year=1991 |citeseerx=10.1.1.420.1478 }}</ref><ref> Russell Impagliazzo, Moti Yung: Direct Minimum-Knowledge Computations. CRYPTO 1987: 40-51 </ref>). But the concept was used without being treated formally prior to that.<ref name=\"Naor\" /><ref name=\"Crepeau\">Claude Cr\u00e9peau, ''Commitment'', [http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/PDF/Commit.pdf MCgill.ca], accessed April 11, 2008</ref> The notion of commitments appeared earliest in works by [[Manuel Blum]],<ref name=\"Blum\" /> [[Shimon Even]],<ref name=\"Even\">Shimon Even.  ''Protocol for signing contracts.''  In [[Allen Gersho]], ed., ''Advances in Cryptography'' (proceedings of CRYPTO '82), pp. 148\u2013153, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, 1982.</ref> and [[Adi Shamir|Shamir]] et al.<ref name=\"SRA81\">A. Shamir, [[R. L. Rivest]], and L. Adleman, ''[[Mental Poker]].''  In [[David A. Klarner]], ed., ''The Mathematical Gardner'', pp. 37\u201343.  Wadsworth, Belmont, California, 1981.</ref> The terminology seems to have been originated by Blum,<ref name=\"Crepeau\" /> although commitment schemes can be interchangeably called '''bit commitment schemes'''\u2014sometimes reserved for the special case where the committed value is a [[bit]]. Earlier to that, commitment via one-way hash functions was considered, e.g., as part of, say, [[Lamport signature]], the original  one-time one-bit signature scheme.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Coin flipping===\n\nSuppose [[Alice and Bob]] want to resolve some dispute via [[coin flipping]]. If they are physically in the same place, a typical procedure might be:\n\n# Alice \"calls\" the coin flip\n# Bob flips the coin\n# If Alice's call is correct, she wins, otherwise Bob wins\n\nIf Alice and Bob are not in the same place a problem arises. Once Alice has \"called\" the coin flip, Bob can stipulate the flip \"results\" to be whatever is most desirable for him. Similarly, if Alice doesn't announce her \"call\" to Bob, after Bob flips the coin and announces the result, Alice can report that she called whatever result is most desirable for her. Alice and Bob can use commitments in a procedure that will allow both to trust the outcome:\n\n# Alice \"calls\" the coin flip but only tells Bob a ''commitment'' to her call,\n# Bob flips the coin and reports the result,\n# Alice reveals what she committed to,\n# Bob verifies that Alice's call matches her commitment,\n# If Alice's revelation matches the coin result Bob reported, Alice wins\n\nFor Bob to be able to skew the results to his favor, he must be able to understand the call hidden in Alice's commitment. If the commitment scheme is a good one, Bob cannot skew the results.

Commitments are used in zero-knowledge proofs for two main purposes: first, to allow the prover to participate in \"cut and choose\" proofs where the verifier will be presented with a choice of what to learn, and the prover will reveal only what corresponds to the verifier's choice. Commitment schemes allow the prover to specify all the information in advance, and only reveal what should be revealed later in the proof.<ref name=\"GMW\">[[Oded Goldreich]], [[Silvio Micali]], and [[Avi Wigderson]], ''[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=116825.116852 Proofs that yield nothing but their validity, or all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems],'' [[Journal of the ACM]], 38: 3, pp. 690\u2013728, 1991</ref> Commitments are also used in zero-knowledge proofs by the verifier, who will often specify their choices ahead of time in a commitment.

In this way, the prior public commitment to the secret values becomes a critical part of the functioning of the system.\n\nBecause the [[Lamport signature]] system cannot be used more than once (see the [[Lamport signature|relevant article]] for details), a system to combine many Lamport Key-sets under a single public value that can be tied to a person and verified by others was developed. This system uses trees of [[Cryptographic hash function|hashes]] to compress many published lamport-key-commitments sets into a single hash value that can be associated with the prospective author of later verified data.\n\n===Verifiable secret sharing ===\nAnother important application of commitments is in [[verifiable secret sharing]], a critical building block of [[secure multiparty computation]]. In a [[secret sharing]] scheme, each of several parties receive \"shares\" of a value that is meant to be hidden from everyone. If enough parties get together, their shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but even a malicious [[cabal]] of insufficient size should learn nothing. Secret sharing is at the root of many protocols for [[secure computation]]: in order to securely compute a function of some shared input, the secret shares are manipulated instead. However, if shares are to be generated by malicious parties, it may be important that those shares can be checked for correctness. In a verifiable secret sharing scheme, the distribution of a secret is accompanied by commitments to the individual shares. The commitments reveal nothing that can help a dishonest cabal, but the shares allow each individual party to check to see if their shares are correct.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gennaro|last2=Rosario|last3=Rabin|first3=Michael O.|last4=Rabin|first4=Tal|title=Simplified VSS and fast-track multiparty computations with applications to threshold cryptography|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing.|volume=1998, June}}</ref>\n\n==Defining the security==\n\nFormal definitions of commitment schemes vary strongly in notation and in flavour. The first such flavour is whether the commitment scheme provides perfect or computational security with respect to the hiding or binding properties.  Another such flavour is whether the commitment is interactive, i.e. whether both the commit phase and the reveal phase can be seen as being executed by a [[cryptographic protocol]] or whether they are non-interactive, consisting of two algorithms ''Commit'' and ''CheckReveal''. In the latter case ''CheckReveal'' can often be seen as a derandomised version of ''Commit'', with the randomness used by ''Commit'' constituting the opening information.\n\nIf the commitment ''C'' to a value ''x'' is computed as ''C:=Commit(x,open)'' with ''open'' the randomness used for computing the commitment, then ''CheckReveal (C,x,open)'' simply consists in verifying the equation ''C=Commit (x,open)''.\n\nUsing this notation and some knowledge about [[mathematical function]]s and [[probability theory]] we formalise different versions of the binding and hiding properties of commitments. The two most important combinations of these properties are perfectly binding and computationally hiding commitment schemes and computationally binding and perfectly hiding commitment schemes. Note that no commitment scheme can be at the same time perfectly binding and perfectly hiding \u2013 a computationally unbounded adversary can simply generate ''Commit(x,open)'' for every value of ''x'' and ''open'' until finding a pair that outputs ''C'', and in a perfectly binding scheme this uniquely identifies ''x''.\n\n===Computational binding===\nLet ''open'' be chosen from a set of size <math>2^k</math>, i.e., it can be represented as a ''k'' bit string, and let  <math>Commit_k</math> be the corresponding commitment scheme. As the size of ''k'' determines the security of the commitment scheme it is called the security parameter.\n\nThen for all [[Uniformity (complexity)|non-uniform]] probabilistic polynomial time algorithms that output <math>x,x'</math> and <math>open, open'</math> of increasing length ''k'', the probability that <math>x \\neq x'</math> and <math>Commit_k(x,open)=Commit_k(x',open')</math> is a [[negligible function]] in ''k''.\n\nThis is a form of [[asymptotic analysis]]. It is also possible to state the same requirement using [[concrete security]]: A commitment scheme ''Commit'' is <math>(t,\\epsilon)</math> secure, if for all algorithms that run in time ''t'' and output <math>x,x',open,open'</math> the probability that <math>x \\neq x'</math> and <math>Commit(x,open)=Commit(x',open')</math> is at most <math>\\epsilon</math>.\n\n===Perfect, statistical, and computational hiding===\n\nLet <math>U_k</math> be the uniform distribution over the <math>2^k</math> opening values for security parameter ''k''. A commitment scheme is respectively perfect, statistical, or computational hiding, if for all <math>x\\neq x'</math> the [[probability ensemble]]s <math>\\{Commit_k(x,U_k)\\}_{k\\in\\N}</math> and <math>\\{Commit_k(x',U_k)\\}_{k\\in\\N}</math> are equal, [[statistically close]], or [[computationally indistinguishable]].\n\n===Impossibility of universally composable commitment schemes===\n\nIt is impossible to realize commitment schemes in the [[universal composability]]\n(UC) framework. The reason is that UC commitment has to be ''extractable'', as shown by Canetti and Fischlin<ref>R. Canetti and M. Fischlin. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/055 Universally Composable Commitments.]</ref> and explained below.\n\nThe ideal commitment functionality, denoted here by ''F'', works roughly as follows. Committer ''C'' sends value ''m'' to ''F'', which\nstores it and sends \"receipt\" to receiver ''R''. Later, ''C'' sends \"open\" to\n''F'', which sends ''m'' to ''R''.\n\nNow, assume we have a protocol ''&pi;'' that realizes this functionality. Suppose that the committer ''C'' is corrupted. In the UC framework, that essentially means that ''C'' is now controlled by the environment, which attempts to distinguish protocol execution from the ideal process. Consider an environment that chooses a message ''m'' and then tells ''C'' to act as prescribed by ''&pi;'', as if it has committed to ''m''. Note here that in order to realize ''F'', the receiver must, after receiving a commitment, output a message \"receipt\". After the environment sees this message, it tells ''C'' to open the commitment.\n\nThe protocol is only secure if this scenario is indistinguishable from the ideal case, where the functionality interacts with a simulator ''S''. Here, ''S'' has control of ''C''. In particular, whenever ''R'' outputs \"receipt\", ''F'' has to do likewise. The only way to do that is for ''S'' to tell ''C'' to send a value to ''F''. However, note\nthat by this point, ''m'' is not known to ''S''. Hence, when the commitment is opened during protocol execution, it is unlikely that ''F'' will open to ''m'', unless ''S'' can extract ''m'' from the messages it received from the environment before ''R'' outputs the receipt.\n\nHowever a protocol that is extractable in this sense cannot be statistically hiding. Suppose such a simulator ''S'' exists. Now consider an\nenvironment that, instead of corrupting ''C'', corrupts ''R'' instead. Additionally it runs a copy of ''S''. Messages received from ''C'' are fed into ''S'', and replies from ''S'' are forwarded to ''C''.\n\nThe environment initially tells ''C'' to commit to a message ''m''. At some point in the interaction, ''S'' will commit to a value ''m'''; this message is handed to ''R'', who outputs ''m'''. Note that by assumption we have ''m' = m'' with high probability. Now in the ideal process the simulator has to come up with ''m''. But this is impossible, because at this point the commitment has not been opened yet, so the only message ''R'' can have received in the ideal process is a \"receipt\" message. We thus have a contradiction.\n\n==Construction==\n\nA commitment scheme can either be perfectly binding (it is impossible for Alice to alter her commitment after she has made it, even if she has unbounded computational resources) or perfectly concealing (it is impossible for Bob to find out the commitment without Alice revealing it, even if he has unbounded computational resources) but not both.\n\n===Bit-commitment in the random oracle model===\n\nBit-commitment schemes are trivial to construct in the [[random oracle]] model. Given a [[cryptographic hash function|hash function]] H with a 3''k'' bit output, to commit the ''k''-bit message ''m'', Alice generates a random ''k'' bit string ''R'' and sends Bob H(''R''||''m''). The probability that any ''R''{{'}}, ''m''{{'}} exist where ''m''{{'}} \u2260 ''m'' such that H(''R''{{'}}||''m''{{'}}) = H(''R''||''m'') is \u2248 2<sup>\u2212''k''</sup>, but to test any guess at the message ''m'' Bob will need to make 2<sup>''k''</sup> (for an incorrect guess) or 2<sup>''k''-1</sup> (on average, for a correct guess) queries to the random oracle.<ref>{{Citation\n| last       = Wagner\n| first      = David\n| year       = 2006\n| title      = Midterm Solution\n| page       = 2\n| url        = http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/teaching/cs276-s06/mtsol.ps\n| accessdate = 26 October 2015\n}}</ref> We note that earlier schemes based on hash functions, essentially can be thought of schemes based on idealization of these hash functions as random oracle.\n\n===Bit-commitment from any one-way permutation===\n\nOne can create a bit-commitment scheme from any [[one-way function]] that is injective. The scheme relies on the fact that every one-way function can be modified (via the [[Goldreich-Levin theorem]]) to possess a computationally [[hard-core predicate]] (while retaining the injective property). Let ''f'' be an injective one-way function, with ''h'' a hard-core predicate. Then to commit to a bit ''b'' Alice picks a random input ''x'' and sends the triple\n:<math>(h,f(x),b \\oplus h(x))</math>\nto Bob, where <math>\\oplus</math> denotes XOR, ''i.e.'', bitwise addition modulo 2. To decommit, Alice simply sends ''x'' to Bob. Bob verifies by computing ''f''(''x'') and comparing to the committed value. This scheme is concealing because for Bob to recover ''b'' he must recover ''h''(''x''). Since ''h'' is a computationally hard-core predicate, recovering ''h''(''x'') from  ''f''(''x'') with probability greater than one-half is as hard as inverting ''f''. Perfect binding follows from the fact that ''f'' is injective and thus ''f''(''x'') has exactly one preimage.\n\n===Bit-commitment from a pseudo-random generator===\n\nNote that since we do not know how to construct a one-way permutation from any one-way function, this section reduces the strength of the cryptographic assumption necessary to construct a bit-commitment protocol.\n\nIn 1991 Moni Naor showed how to create a bit-commitment scheme from a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/22544/0 |title=Citations: Bit Commitment using Pseudorandom Generators - Naor (ResearchIndex) |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate=2014-06-07 |url-access=registration}}</ref> The construction is as follows. If ''G'' is pseudo-random generator such that ''G'' takes ''n'' bits to 3''n'' bits, then if Alice wants to commit to a bit ''b'':\n\n*Bob selects a random 3''n''-bit vector ''R'' and sends ''R'' to Alice.\n*Alice selects a random ''n''-bit vector ''Y'' and computes the 3''n''-bit vector ''G''(''Y'').\n*If ''b''=1 Alice sends ''G''(''Y'') to Bob, otherwise she sends the bitwise [[Exclusive disjunction|exclusive-or]] of ''G''(''Y'') and ''R'' to Bob.\n\nTo decommit Alice sends ''Y'' to Bob, who can then check whether he initially received ''G''(''Y'') or ''G''(''Y'') <math>\\oplus</math> ''R''.\n\nThis scheme is statistically binding, meaning that even if Alice is computationally unbounded she cannot cheat with probability greater than 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. For Alice to cheat, she would need to find a ''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>'', such that ''G''(''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>'') = ''G''(''Y'') <math>\\oplus</math> ''R''. If she could find such a value, she could decommit by sending the truth and ''Y'', or send the opposite answer and ''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>''. However, ''G''(''Y'') and ''G''(''Y''') are only able to produce 2<sup>''n''</sup> possible values each (that's 2<sup>2''n''</sup>) while ''R'' is picked out of 2<sup>3''n''</sup> values. She does not pick ''R'', so there is a 2<sup>2''n''</sup>/2<sup>3''n''</sup> = 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> probability that a ''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>'' satisfying the equation required to cheat will exist.\n\nThe concealing property follows from a standard reduction, if Bob can tell whether Alice committed to a zero or one, he can also distinguish the output of the pseudo-random generator ''G'' from true-random, which contradicts the cryptographic security of ''G''.\n\n===A perfectly binding scheme based on the discrete log problem and beyond===\n\nAlice chooses a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of prime order ''p'', with generator ''g''.\n\nAlice randomly picks a secret value ''x'' from ''0'' to ''p''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 to commit to and calculates ''c'' = ''g''<sup>''x''</sup> and publishes ''c''. The [[discrete logarithm problem]] dictates that from ''c'', it is computationally infeasible to compute ''x'', so under this assumption, Bob cannot compute ''x''. On the other hand, Alice cannot compute a ''x&#39;'' <> ''x'', such that ''g''<sup>''x&#39;''</sup> = ''c'', so the scheme is binding.\n\nThis scheme isn't perfectly concealing as someone could find the commitment if he manages to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]]. In fact, this scheme isn't hiding at all with respect to the standard hiding game, where an adversary should be unable to guess which of two messages he chose were committed to - similar to the [[IND-CPA]] game. One consequence of this is that if the space of possible values of ''x'' is small, then an attacker could simply try them all and the commitment would not be hiding.\n\nA better example of a perfectly binding commitment scheme is one where the commitment is the encryption of ''x'' under a [[semantically secure]], public-key encryption scheme with perfect completeness, and the decommitment is the string of random bits used to encrypt ''x''. An example of an information-theoretically hiding commitment scheme is the Pedersen commitment scheme, which is binding under the discrete logarithm assumption. Additionally to the scheme above, it uses another generator ''h'' of the prime group and a random number ''r''. The commitment is set <math>c=g^x h^r</math>.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tang |first1=Chunming |last2=Pei |first2=Dingyi |last3=Liu |first3=Zhuojun |last4=He |first4=Yong |title=Pedersen: Non-interactive and information-theoretic secure verifiable secret sharing |url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/201.pdf |website=Cryptology ePrint Archive |publisher=Advances in Cryptology CRYPTO 1991 Springer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811001441/https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/201.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2017 |url-status=dead |language=English |date=16 August 2004 |access-date=2 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThese constructions are tightly related to and  based on the algebraic properties of the underlying groups, and the notion originally seemed to be very much related to the algebra. However, it was shown that basing statistically binding commitment schemes on general unstructured assumption is possible, via the notion of interactive hashing \nfor commitments from general complexity assumptions (specifically and originally, based on any one way permutation) as in  <ref>Moni Naor, Rafail Ostrovsky, Ramarathnam Venkatesan, Moti Yung:\nPerfect Zero-Knowledge Arguments for NP Using Any One-Way Permutation.

Cryptology 11(2): 87-108 (1998)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs001459900037]</ref>.\n\n==Quantum bit commitment==\nIt is an interesting question in [[quantum cryptography]] if ''unconditionally secure'' bit commitment protocols exist on the quantum level, that is, protocols which are (at least asymptotically) binding and concealing even if there are no restrictions on the computational resources. One could hope that there might be a way to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanics, as in the protocols for [[Quantum key distribution|unconditionally secure key distribution]].\n\nHowever, this is impossible, as Dominic Mayers showed in 1996 (see <ref>Brassard, Cr\u00e9peau, Mayers, Salvail: [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9712023 A brief review on the impossibility of quantum bit commitment]</ref> for the original proof). Any such protocol can be reduced to a protocol where the system is in one of two pure states after the commitment phase, depending on the bit Alice wants to commit. If the protocol is unconditionally concealing, then Alice can unitarily transform these states into each other using the properties of the [[Schmidt decomposition]], effectively defeating the binding property.\n\nOne subtle assumption of the proof is that the commit phase must be finished at some point in time. This leaves room for protocols that require a continuing information flow until the bit is unveiled or the protocol is cancelled, in which case it is not binding anymore.<ref>A. Kent: [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9906103 Secure classical Bit Commitment using Fixed Capacity Communication Channels]</ref> More generally,  Mayers' proof applies only to protocols that exploit [[quantum physics]] but not [[special relativity]].

Commitment schemes have important applications in a number of [[cryptographic protocol]]s including secure [[coin flipping#Telecommunications|coin flipping]], [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, and [[secure computation]].\n\nA way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changed&mdash;merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time.\n\nInteractions in a commitment scheme take place in two phases:\n\n# the ''commit phase'' during which a value is chosen and specified\n# the ''reveal phase'' during which the value is revealed and checked\n\nIn simple protocols, the commit phase consists of a single message from the sender to the receiver. This message is called ''the commitment''. It is essential that the specific value chosen cannot be known by the receiver at that time (this is called the ''hiding'' property). A simple reveal phase would consist of a single message, ''the opening'', from the sender to the receiver, followed by a check performed by the receiver. The value chosen during the commit phase must be the only one that the sender can compute and that validates during the reveal phase (this is called the ''binding'' property).\n\nThe concept of commitment schemes was perhaps first formalized by [[Gilles Brassard]], [[David Chaum]], and [[Claude Crepeau]] in 1988,<ref name=\"BCC\">Gilles Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crepeau, ''[http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/PDF/BCC88-jcss.pdf Minimum Disclosure Proofs of Knowledge]'', Journal of Computer and System Sciences, vol. 37, pp. 156\u2013189, 1988.</ref> as part of various Zero-Knowledge protocols for ''NP'', based on various types of commitment schemes (see also: <ref>{{cite journal |first=Oded |last=Goldreich |first2=Silvio |last2=Micali |first3=Avi |last3=Wigderson |title=Proofs that yield nothing but their validity |journal=Journal of the ACM |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=690\u2013728 |doi=10.1145/116825.116852 |year=1991 |citeseerx=10.1.1.420.1478 }}</ref><ref> Russell Impagliazzo, Moti Yung: Direct Minimum-Knowledge Computations.

Earlier to that, commitment via one-way hash functions was considered, e.g., as part of, say, [[Lamport signature]], the original  one-time one-bit signature scheme.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Coin flipping===\n\nSuppose [[Alice and Bob]] want to resolve some dispute via [[coin flipping]]. If they are physically in the same place, a typical procedure might be:\n\n# Alice \"calls\" the coin flip\n# Bob flips the coin\n# If Alice's call is correct, she wins, otherwise Bob wins\n\nIf Alice and Bob are not in the same place a problem arises. Once Alice has \"called\" the coin flip, Bob can stipulate the flip \"results\" to be whatever is most desirable for him. Similarly, if Alice doesn't announce her \"call\" to Bob, after Bob flips the coin and announces the result, Alice can report that she called whatever result is most desirable for her. Alice and Bob can use commitments in a procedure that will allow both to trust the outcome:\n\n# Alice \"calls\" the coin flip but only tells Bob a ''commitment'' to her call,\n# Bob flips the coin and reports the result,\n# Alice reveals what she committed to,\n# Bob verifies that Alice's call matches her commitment,\n# If Alice's revelation matches the coin result Bob reported, Alice wins\n\nFor Bob to be able to skew the results to his favor, he must be able to understand the call hidden in Alice's commitment. If the commitment scheme is a good one, Bob cannot skew the results.  Similarly, Alice cannot affect the result if she cannot change the value she commits to.<ref name=\"Naor\">Moni Naor, ''[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/naor91bit.html Bit Commitment Using Pseudorandomness]'', Journal of Cryptology 4: 2 pp. 151\u2013158, 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Blum\">Manuel Blum, ''[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/coin/in4.html Coin Flipping by Telephone]'', Proceedings of [[CRYPTO]] 1981, pp. 11\u201315, 1981, reprinted in SIGACT News vol. 15, pp. 23\u201327, 1983.</ref>\n\nA real-life application of this problem exists, when people (often in media) commit to a decision or give an answer in a \"sealed envelope\", which is then opened later. \"Let's find out if that's what the candidate answered\", for example on a game show, can serve as a model of this system.\n\n===Zero-knowledge proofs===\n\nOne particular motivating example is the use of commitment schemes in [[zero-knowledge proof]]s.

Commitment schemes allow the prover to specify all the information in advance, and only reveal what should be revealed later in the proof.<ref name=\"GMW\">[[Oded Goldreich]], [[Silvio Micali]], and [[Avi Wigderson]], ''[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=116825.116852 Proofs that yield nothing but their validity, or all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems],'' [[Journal of the ACM]], 38: 3, pp. 690\u2013728, 1991</ref> Commitments are also used in zero-knowledge proofs by the verifier, who will often specify their choices ahead of time in a commitment. This allows zero-knowledge proofs to be composed in parallel without revealing additional information to the prover.<ref name=\"GK\">Oded Goldreich and [[Hugo Krawczyk]], ''[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/goldreich90composition.html On the Composition of Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems]'', [[SIAM Journal on Computing]], 25: 1, pp. 169\u2013192, 1996</ref>\n\n===Signature schemes===\nThe [[Lamport signature|Lamport signature scheme]] is a [[digital signature]] system that relies on maintaining two sets of secret data packets, publishing [[Cryptographic hash function|verifiable hashes]] of the data packets, and then selectively revealing partial secret data packets in a manner that conforms specifically to the data to be signed. In this way, the prior public commitment to the secret values becomes a critical part of the functioning of the system.\n\nBecause the [[Lamport signature]] system cannot be used more than once (see the [[Lamport signature|relevant article]] for details), a system to combine many Lamport Key-sets under a single public value that can be tied to a person and verified by others was developed. This system uses trees of [[Cryptographic hash function|hashes]] to compress many published lamport-key-commitments sets into a single hash value that can be associated with the prospective author of later verified data.\n\n===Verifiable secret sharing ===\nAnother important application of commitments is in [[verifiable secret sharing]], a critical building block of [[secure multiparty computation]]. In a [[secret sharing]] scheme, each of several parties receive \"shares\" of a value that is meant to be hidden from everyone. If enough parties get together, their shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but even a malicious [[cabal]] of insufficient size should learn nothing. Secret sharing is at the root of many protocols for [[secure computation]]: in order to securely compute a function of some shared input, the secret shares are manipulated instead. However, if shares are to be generated by malicious parties, it may be important that those shares can be checked for correctness. In a verifiable secret sharing scheme, the distribution of a secret is accompanied by commitments to the individual shares. The commitments reveal nothing that can help a dishonest cabal, but the shares allow each individual party to check to see if their shares are correct.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gennaro|last2=Rosario|last3=Rabin|first3=Michael O.|last4=Rabin|first4=Tal|title=Simplified VSS and fast-track multiparty computations with applications to threshold cryptography|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing.|volume=1998, June}}</ref>\n\n==Defining the security==\n\nFormal definitions of commitment schemes vary strongly in notation and in flavour. The first such flavour is whether the commitment scheme provides perfect or computational security with respect to the hiding or binding properties.  Another such flavour is whether the commitment is interactive, i.e. whether both the commit phase and the reveal phase can be seen as being executed by a [[cryptographic protocol]] or whether they are non-interactive, consisting of two algorithms ''Commit'' and ''CheckReveal''. In the latter case ''CheckReveal'' can often be seen as a derandomised version of ''Commit'', with the randomness used by ''Commit'' constituting the opening information.\n\nIf the commitment ''C'' to a value ''x'' is computed as ''C:=Commit(x,open)'' with ''open'' the randomness used for computing the commitment, then ''CheckReveal (C,x,open)'' simply consists in verifying the equation ''C=Commit (x,open)''.\n\nUsing this notation and some knowledge about [[mathematical function]]s and [[probability theory]] we formalise different versions of the binding and hiding properties of commitments. The two most important combinations of these properties are perfectly binding and computationally hiding commitment schemes and computationally binding and perfectly hiding commitment schemes. Note that no commitment scheme can be at the same time perfectly binding and perfectly hiding \u2013 a computationally unbounded adversary can simply generate ''Commit(x,open)'' for every value of ''x'' and ''open'' until finding a pair that outputs ''C'', and in a perfectly binding scheme this uniquely identifies ''x''.\n\n===Computational binding===\nLet ''open'' be chosen from a set of size <math>2^k</math>, i.e., it can be represented as a ''k'' bit string, and let  <math>Commit_k</math> be the corresponding commitment scheme. As the size of ''k'' determines the security of the commitment scheme it is called the security parameter.\n\nThen for all [[Uniformity (complexity)|non-uniform]] probabilistic polynomial time algorithms that output <math>x,x'</math> and <math>open, open'</math> of increasing length ''k'', the probability that <math>x \\neq x'</math> and <math>Commit_k(x,open)=Commit_k(x',open')</math> is a [[negligible function]] in ''k''.\n\nThis is a form of [[asymptotic analysis]]. It is also possible to state the same requirement using [[concrete security]]: A commitment scheme ''Commit'' is <math>(t,\\epsilon)</math> secure, if for all algorithms that run in time ''t'' and output <math>x,x',open,open'</math> the probability that <math>x \\neq x'</math> and <math>Commit(x,open)=Commit(x',open')</math> is at most <math>\\epsilon</math>.\n\n===Perfect, statistical, and computational hiding===\n\nLet <math>U_k</math> be the uniform distribution over the <math>2^k</math> opening values for security parameter ''k''. A commitment scheme is respectively perfect, statistical, or computational hiding, if for all <math>x\\neq x'</math> the [[probability ensemble]]s <math>\\{Commit_k(x,U_k)\\}_{k\\in\\N}</math> and <math>\\{Commit_k(x',U_k)\\}_{k\\in\\N}</math> are equal, [[statistically close]], or [[computationally indistinguishable]].\n\n===Impossibility of universally composable commitment schemes===\n\nIt is impossible to realize commitment schemes in the [[universal composability]]\n(UC) framework. The reason is that UC commitment has to be ''extractable'', as shown by Canetti and Fischlin<ref>R. Canetti and M. Fischlin. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/055 Universally Composable Commitments.]</ref> and explained below.\n\nThe ideal commitment functionality, denoted here by ''F'', works roughly as follows. Committer ''C'' sends value ''m'' to ''F'', which\nstores it and sends \"receipt\" to receiver ''R''. Later, ''C'' sends \"open\" to\n''F'', which sends ''m'' to ''R''.\n\nNow, assume we have a protocol ''&pi;'' that realizes this functionality. Suppose that the committer ''C'' is corrupted. In the UC framework, that essentially means that ''C'' is now controlled by the environment, which attempts to distinguish protocol execution from the ideal process. Consider an environment that chooses a message ''m'' and then tells ''C'' to act as prescribed by ''&pi;'', as if it has committed to ''m''. Note here that in order to realize ''F'', the receiver must, after receiving a commitment, output a message \"receipt\". After the environment sees this message, it tells ''C'' to open the commitment.\n\nThe protocol is only secure if this scenario is indistinguishable from the ideal case, where the functionality interacts with a simulator ''S''. Here, ''S'' has control of ''C''. In particular, whenever ''R'' outputs \"receipt\", ''F'' has to do likewise. The only way to do that is for ''S'' to tell ''C'' to send a value to ''F''. However, note\nthat by this point, ''m'' is not known to ''S''. Hence, when the commitment is opened during protocol execution, it is unlikely that ''F'' will open to ''m'', unless ''S'' can extract ''m'' from the messages it received from the environment before ''R'' outputs the receipt.\n\nHowever a protocol that is extractable in this sense cannot be statistically hiding. Suppose such a simulator ''S'' exists. Now consider an\nenvironment that, instead of corrupting ''C'', corrupts ''R'' instead. Additionally it runs a copy of ''S''. Messages received from ''C'' are fed into ''S'', and replies from ''S'' are forwarded to ''C''.\n\nThe environment initially tells ''C'' to commit to a message ''m''. At some point in the interaction, ''S'' will commit to a value ''m'''; this message is handed to ''R'', who outputs ''m'''. Note that by assumption we have ''m' = m'' with high probability. Now in the ideal process the simulator has to come up with ''m''. But this is impossible, because at this point the commitment has not been opened yet, so the only message ''R'' can have received in the ideal process is a \"receipt\" message. We thus have a contradiction.\n\n==Construction==\n\nA commitment scheme can either be perfectly binding (it is impossible for Alice to alter her commitment after she has made it, even if she has unbounded computational resources) or perfectly concealing (it is impossible for Bob to find out the commitment without Alice revealing it, even if he has unbounded computational resources) but not both.\n\n===Bit-commitment in the random oracle model===\n\nBit-commitment schemes are trivial to construct in the [[random oracle]] model. Given a [[cryptographic hash function|hash function]] H with a 3''k'' bit output, to commit the ''k''-bit message ''m'', Alice generates a random ''k'' bit string ''R'' and sends Bob H(''R''||''m''). The probability that any ''R''{{'}}, ''m''{{'}} exist where ''m''{{'}} \u2260 ''m'' such that H(''R''{{'}}||''m''{{'}}) = H(''R''||''m'') is \u2248 2<sup>\u2212''k''</sup>, but to test any guess at the message ''m'' Bob will need to make 2<sup>''k''</sup> (for an incorrect guess) or 2<sup>''k''-1</sup> (on average, for a correct guess) queries to the random oracle.<ref>{{Citation\n| last       = Wagner\n| first      = David\n| year       = 2006\n| title      = Midterm Solution\n| page       = 2\n| url        = http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/teaching/cs276-s06/mtsol.ps\n| accessdate = 26 October 2015\n}}</ref> We note that earlier schemes based on hash functions, essentially can be thought of schemes based on idealization of these hash functions as random oracle.\n\n===Bit-commitment from any one-way permutation===\n\nOne can create a bit-commitment scheme from any [[one-way function]] that is injective. The scheme relies on the fact that every one-way function can be modified (via the [[Goldreich-Levin theorem]]) to possess a computationally [[hard-core predicate]] (while retaining the injective property). Let ''f'' be an injective one-way function, with ''h'' a hard-core predicate. Then to commit to a bit ''b'' Alice picks a random input ''x'' and sends the triple\n:<math>(h,f(x),b \\oplus h(x))</math>\nto Bob, where <math>\\oplus</math> denotes XOR, ''i.e.'', bitwise addition modulo 2. To decommit, Alice simply sends ''x'' to Bob. Bob verifies by computing ''f''(''x'') and comparing to the committed value. This scheme is concealing because for Bob to recover ''b'' he must recover ''h''(''x''). Since ''h'' is a computationally hard-core predicate, recovering ''h''(''x'') from  ''f''(''x'') with probability greater than one-half is as hard as inverting ''f''. Perfect binding follows from the fact that ''f'' is injective and thus ''f''(''x'') has exactly one preimage.\n\n===Bit-commitment from a pseudo-random generator===\n\nNote that since we do not know how to construct a one-way permutation from any one-way function, this section reduces the strength of the cryptographic assumption necessary to construct a bit-commitment protocol.\n\nIn 1991 Moni Naor showed how to create a bit-commitment scheme from a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/22544/0 |title=Citations: Bit Commitment using Pseudorandom Generators - Naor (ResearchIndex) |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate=2014-06-07 |url-access=registration}}</ref> The construction is as follows. If ''G'' is pseudo-random generator such that ''G'' takes ''n'' bits to 3''n'' bits, then if Alice wants to commit to a bit ''b'':\n\n*Bob selects a random 3''n''-bit vector ''R'' and sends ''R'' to Alice.\n*Alice selects a random ''n''-bit vector ''Y'' and computes the 3''n''-bit vector ''G''(''Y'').\n*If ''b''=1 Alice sends ''G''(''Y'') to Bob, otherwise she sends the bitwise [[Exclusive disjunction|exclusive-or]] of ''G''(''Y'') and ''R'' to Bob.\n\nTo decommit Alice sends ''Y'' to Bob, who can then check whether he initially received ''G''(''Y'') or ''G''(''Y'') <math>\\oplus</math> ''R''.\n\nThis scheme is statistically binding, meaning that even if Alice is computationally unbounded she cannot cheat with probability greater than 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. For Alice to cheat, she would need to find a ''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>'', such that ''G''(''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>'') = ''G''(''Y'') <math>\\oplus</math> ''R''. If she could find such a value, she could decommit by sending the truth and ''Y'', or send the opposite answer and ''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>''. However, ''G''(''Y'') and ''G''(''Y''') are only able to produce 2<sup>''n''</sup> possible values each (that's 2<sup>2''n''</sup>) while ''R'' is picked out of 2<sup>3''n''</sup> values. She does not pick ''R'', so there is a 2<sup>2''n''</sup>/2<sup>3''n''</sup> = 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> probability that a ''<nowiki>Y'</nowiki>'' satisfying the equation required to cheat will exist.\n\nThe concealing property follows from a standard reduction, if Bob can tell whether Alice committed to a zero or one, he can also distinguish the output of the pseudo-random generator ''G'' from true-random, which contradicts the cryptographic security of ''G''.\n\n===A perfectly binding scheme based on the discrete log problem and beyond===\n\nAlice chooses a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of prime order ''p'', with generator ''g''.\n\nAlice randomly picks a secret value ''x'' from ''0'' to ''p''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 to commit to and calculates ''c'' = ''g''<sup>''x''</sup> and publishes ''c''. The [[discrete logarithm problem]] dictates that from ''c'', it is computationally infeasible to compute ''x'', so under this assumption, Bob cannot compute ''x''. On the other hand, Alice cannot compute a ''x&#39;'' <> ''x'', such that ''g''<sup>''x&#39;''</sup> = ''c'', so the scheme is binding.\n\nThis scheme isn't perfectly concealing as someone could find the commitment if he manages to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]]. In fact, this scheme isn't hiding at all with respect to the standard hiding game, where an adversary should be unable to guess which of two messages he chose were committed to - similar to the [[IND-CPA]] game. One consequence of this is that if the space of possible values of ''x'' is small, then an attacker could simply try them all and the commitment would not be hiding.\n\nA better example of a perfectly binding commitment scheme is one where the commitment is the encryption of ''x'' under a [[semantically secure]], public-key encryption scheme with perfect completeness, and the decommitment is the string of random bits used to encrypt ''x''. An example of an information-theoretically hiding commitment scheme is the Pedersen commitment scheme, which is binding under the discrete logarithm assumption. Additionally to the scheme above, it uses another generator ''h'' of the prime group and a random number ''r''. The commitment is set <math>c=g^x h^r</math>.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tang |first1=Chunming |last2=Pei |first2=Dingyi |last3=Liu |first3=Zhuojun |last4=He |first4=Yong |title=Pedersen: Non-interactive and information-theoretic secure verifiable secret sharing |url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/201.pdf |website=Cryptology ePrint Archive |publisher=Advances in Cryptology CRYPTO 1991 Springer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811001441/https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/201.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2017 |url-status=dead |language=English |date=16 August 2004 |access-date=2 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThese constructions are tightly related to and  based on the algebraic properties of the underlying groups, and the notion originally seemed to be very much related to the algebra. However, it was shown that basing statistically binding commitment schemes on general unstructured assumption is possible, via the notion of interactive hashing \nfor commitments from general complexity assumptions (specifically and originally, based on any one way permutation) as in  <ref>Moni Naor, Rafail Ostrovsky, Ramarathnam Venkatesan, Moti Yung:\nPerfect Zero-Knowledge Arguments for NP Using Any One-Way Permutation. J. Cryptology 11(2): 87-108 (1998)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs001459900037]</ref>.\n\n==Quantum bit commitment==\nIt is an interesting question in [[quantum cryptography]] if ''unconditionally secure'' bit commitment protocols exist on the quantum level, that is, protocols which are (at least asymptotically) binding and concealing even if there are no restrictions on the computational resources. One could hope that there might be a way to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanics, as in the protocols for [[Quantum key distribution|unconditionally secure key distribution]].\n\nHowever, this is impossible, as Dominic Mayers showed in 1996 (see <ref>Brassard, Cr\u00e9peau, Mayers, Salvail: [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9712023 A brief review on the impossibility of quantum bit commitment]</ref> for the original proof). Any such protocol can be reduced to a protocol where the system is in one of two pure states after the commitment phase, depending on the bit Alice wants to commit. If the protocol is unconditionally concealing, then Alice can unitarily transform these states into each other using the properties of the [[Schmidt decomposition]], effectively defeating the binding property.\n\nOne subtle assumption of the proof is that the commit phase must be finished at some point in time. This leaves room for protocols that require a continuing information flow until the bit is unveiled or the protocol is cancelled, in which case it is not binding anymore.<ref>A. Kent: [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9906103 Secure classical Bit Commitment using Fixed Capacity Communication Channels]</ref> More generally,  Mayers' proof applies only to protocols that exploit [[quantum physics]] but not [[special relativity]]. Kent has shown that there exist unconditionally secure protocols for bit commitment that exploit the principle of [[special relativity]] stating that information cannot travel faster than light.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kent|first=A.|date= 1999|title=Unconditionally Secure Bit Commitment|journal=Phys.
