Following [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s successful introduction of [[Constitution Act, 1867|federation in Canada]], it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] in South Africa. In 1874, [[Henry Bartle Frere|Sir Henry Bartle Frere]] was sent to South Africa as [[High Commissioner]] for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the [[South African Republic]] and the Kingdom of [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] and its army.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 8.</ref>\n\nFrere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government{{sfn|Spiers|2006|p=41}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=9}} states \"By late 1878 Frere had manipulated a diplomatic crisis with the Zulus...\" }} and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an [[Anglo-Zulu War#Terms of the Ultimatum|ultimatum]] on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king [[Cetshwayo]] with which the Zulu king could not comply, including disbanding his army and abandoning key cultural traditions.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=261\u201362}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=11}} notes \"... an ultimatum with which, Frere knew, they could not possibly comply\". }} Bartle Frere then sent [[Frederic Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] to invade Zululand after this ultimatum was not met.{{sfn|Morris|1998|pp= 291\u201392}} The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at [[Rorke's Drift]] by a small force of British troops. The war eventually resulted in a British victory and the end of the Zulu nation's dominance of the region.\n\n==Background==\npeneeee\nBy the 1850s the British Empire had colonies in southern Africa bordering on various [[Boer]] settlements, native African kingdoms such as the Zulus, the [[Basotho]] and numerous indigenous tribal areas and states. Various interactions with these followed an expansionist policy. [[Cape Colony]] had been formed after the [[Anglo\u2013Dutch Treaty of 1814]] permanently ceded the Dutch colony of [[Cape Town]] to Britain, and its territory expanded very substantially through the 19th century. [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in south-eastern Africa was proclaimed a British colony on 4 May 1843 after the British government had annexed the [[Boer]] [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]]. Matters were brought to a head when three sons and a brother of the Zulu chief Sirayo organized a raid into Natal and carried off two women who were under British protection.\n\nThe discovery of diamonds in 1867 near the [[Vaal River]], some {{convert|550|mi}} northeast of [[Cape Town]], ended the isolation of the Boers in the interior and changed South African history. The discovery triggered a [[diamond rush]] that attracted people from all over the world, which turned [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] into a town of 50,000 within five years and drew the attention of British imperial interests. In the 1870s, the British annexed [[West Griqualand]], site of the Kimberley diamond discoveries.\n\nIn 1874 [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], who had successfully brought about federation in Canada in 1867, thought that a similar scheme might work in South Africa. The South African plan called for a ruling white minority over a black majority, which would provide a large pool of cheap labour for the British sugar plantations and mines.{{sfn|Gump|1996|pp=73\u201393}} Carnarvon, in an attempt to extend British influence in 1875, approached the Boer states of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[Transvaal Republic]] and tried to organize a federation of the British and Boer territories, but the Boer leaders turned him down.\n\nIn 1877, Sir [[Bartle Frere]] was made [[High Commissioner]] for [[Southern Africa]] by Lord Carnarvon. Carnarvon appointed Frere to the position on the understanding that he would work to enforce Carnarvon's confederation plan and, in return, Frere could then become the first British governor of a federated southern African [[dominion]]. Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner to bring this plan about. One of the obstacles to such a scheme was the presence of the independent states of the [[South African Republic]], informally known as the Transvaal Republic, and the Kingdom of [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]]. Bartle Frere wasted no time in putting the scheme forward and manufacturing a [[casus belli]] against the Zulu by exaggerating the significance of a number of recent incidents.{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=91}}\n[[File:BartleFrere.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Bartle Frere]]]]\nBy 1877, Sir [[Theophilus Shepstone]], the British Secretary for Native Affairs in Natal, annexed the Transvaal Republic for Britain using a special warrant. The Transvaal Boers objected but as long as the Zulu threat remained, found themselves between two threats; they feared that if they took up arms to resist the British annexation actively, King [[Cetshwayo]] and the Zulus would take the opportunity to attack. However, the successive British annexations, and in particular the annexation of West Griqualand, caused a climate of simmering unease for the Boer republics.\n\nShepstone railed against the disruptive effect of allowing Cetshwayo's regime to remain in place. \"Zulu power\", he said, \"is the root and real strength of all native difficulties in South Africa\". In December 1877, he wrote to Carnarvon \"Cetshwayo is the secret hope of every petty independent chief hundreds of miles from him who feels a desire that his color shall prevail, and it will not be until this hope is destroyed that they will make up their minds to submit to the rule of civilization\". Earlier in October 1877, Shepstone had attended a meeting with Zulu leaders near the Blood River to resolve the land dispute between the Zulus and the Boers. He suggested a compromise with the Boers and the meeting broke up without clear resolutions. He turned against the Zulus with vengeance, saying he had come into possession of \"the most incontrovertible, overwhelming and clear evidence\" never previously disclosed, for supporting the claims of the Boers. He rejected Zulu claims as \"characterized by lying and treachery to an extent that I could not have believed even savages are capable of\". {{snf|Meredith|2007|p=89}} \n\nShepstone, in his capacity as British governor of Natal, had expressed concerns about the Zulu army under King Cetshwayo and the potential threat to Natal \u2014 especially given the adoption by some of the Zulus of old muskets and other out-of-date firearms. In his new role of Administrator of the Transvaal, he was now responsible for protecting the Transvaal and had direct involvement in the Zulu border dispute from the side of the Transvaal. Persistent Boer representations and [[Paul Kruger]]'s diplomatic manoeuvrings added to the pressure. There were incidents involving Zulu paramilitary actions on either side of the Transvaal/Natal border, and Shepstone increasingly began to regard King Cetshwayo, as having permitted such \"outrages\", and to be in a \"defiant mood\". King Cetshwayo now found no defender in Natal save the bishop of Natal, [[John Colenso]].\n\nColenso advocated for native Africans in Natal and Zululand who had been unjustly treated by the colonial regime in Natal. In 1874 he took up the cause of [[Langalibalele]] and the Hlubi and Ngwe tribes in representations to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon. Langalibalele had been falsely accused of rebellion in 1873 and, following a charade of a trial, was found guilty and imprisoned on [[Robben Island]]. In taking the side of Langalibalele against the colonial regime in Natal and Theophilus Shepstone, the Secretary for Native Affairs, Colenso found himself even further estranged from colonial society in Natal.\n\nBishop Colenso's concern about the misleading information that was being provided to the Colonial Secretary in London by Shepstone and the Governor of Natal prompted him to champion the cause of the Zulus against Boer oppression and official encroachments. He was a prominent critic of Sir Bartle Frere's efforts to depict the Zulu kingdom as a threat to Natal. Colenso's campaigns revealed the racialist foundation underpinning the colonial regime in Natal and made him enemies among the colonists.\n\n[[British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s Tory administration in London did not want a war with the Zulus. \"The fact is,\" wrote [[Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn|Sir Michael Hicks Beach]], who would replace Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies, in November 1878, \"that matters in Eastern Europe and India&nbsp;... wore so serious an aspect that we cannot have a Zulu war in addition to other greater and too possible troubles.\" However, Sir Bartle Frere had already been into the [[Cape Colony]] as governor and High Commissioner since 1877 with the brief of creating a Confederation of South Africa from the various British colonies, Boer Republics and native states and his plans were well advanced. He had concluded that the powerful Zulu kingdom stood in the way of this, and so was receptive to Shepstone's arguments that King Cetshwayo and his Zulu army posed a threat to the peace of the region. Preparations for a British invasion of the Zulu kingdom had been underway for months. In December 1878, notwithstanding the reluctance of the British government to start yet another colonial war, Frere presented Cetshwayo with an ultimatum that the Zulu army be disbanded and the Zulus accept a British resident. This was unacceptable to the Zulus as it effectively meant that Cetshwayo, had he agreed, would have lost his throne.\n\n===Zulu Kingdom===\n[[File:Cetshwayo-c1875.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of [[Cetshwayo kaMpande]], c.&nbsp;1875]]\n[[Shaka Zulu]], the first Zulu king, had, through war and conquest, built the small Zulu tribe into the Zulu Kingdom which by 1825 encompassed an area of around {{convert|11500|sqmi}}. In 1828 he was assassinated at [[Shaka Memorial|Dukuza]] by one of his [[Induna|inDunas]] and two of his half-brothers, one of whom, [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]], succeeded him as king. By the 1830s  migrating Boers came into conflict with the Zulu Kingdom, then ruled by Dingane. Dingane suffered a crushing defeat on 16 December 1838, when he attacked a group of 470 Voortrekker settlers led by [[Andries Pretorius|Pretorius]] at the [[Battle of Blood River]]. Dingane's half brother, [[Mpande kaSenzangakhona]], then defected with some 17,000 followers and allied with the Boers against Dingane. Dingane was assassinated and Mpande became king of the Zulu empire.\n\nIn 1839, the Boer  [[Voortrekkers]], under Pretorius, formed the Boer [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]], south of the Tugela, and west of the British settlement of Port Natal (now Durban). Mpande and Pretorius maintained peaceful relations. However, in 1842, war broke out between the British and the Boers, resulting in the British annexation of Natalia. Mpande shifted his allegiance to the British, and remained on good terms with them.\n\n[[File:Mpande.jpg|thumb|210px|King [[Mpande kaSenzangakhona|Mpande]]]]\nIn 1843, Mpande ordered a purge of perceived dissidents within his kingdom. This resulted in numerous deaths, and the fleeing of thousands of refugees into neighbouring areas, including the British-controlled Natal. Many of these refugees fled with cattle, the main measure of the Zulu wealth. Mpande began raiding the surrounding areas, culminating in the invasion of [[Swaziland]] in 1852. However, the British pressured him into withdrawing, which he did shortly afterwards. At this time, a battle for the succession broke out between two of Mpande's sons, Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi. This culminated in 1856 with the [[Battle of Ndondakusuka]], which left Mbuyazi dead. Cetshwayo then set about usurping his father's authority. When Mpande died of old age in 1872, Cetshwayo took over as ruler.\n\nIn 1861, Umtonga, a brother of [[Cetshwayo]], and another son of Zulu king [[Mpande]], fled to the Utrecht district, and Cetshwayo assembled an army on that frontier. According to claims later brought forward by the [[Boer]]s, Cetshwayo offered the farmers a strip of land along the border if they would surrender his brother. The Boers complied on the condition that Umtonga's life was spared, and in 1861 Mpande signed a deed transferring this land to the Boers. The south boundary of the land added to Utrecht ran from [[Rorke's Drift]] on the Buffalo to a point on the [[Pongola River]].\n\n[[File:Angas - Zoeloe vrouens brou bier.png|thumb|Zulu village, c. 1849]]\nThe boundary was beaconed in 1864, but when in 1865 Umtonga fled from [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] to [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], Cetshwayo, seeing that he had lost his part of the bargain (for he feared that Umtonga might be used to supplant him, as Mpande had been used to supplant [[Dingane]]), caused the beacon to be removed, and also claimed the land ceded by the [[Swazi people|Swazis]] to [[Lydenburg]]. The Zulus asserted that the Swazis were their vassals and therefore had no right to part with this territory. During the year a [[Boer Commando|Boer commando]] under [[Paul Kruger]] and an army under Cetshwayo were posted to defend the newly acquired Utrecht border. The Zulu forces took back their land north of the Pongola. Questions were also raised as to the validity of the documents signed by the Zulus concerning the Utrecht strip; in 1869 the services of the lieutenant-governor of Natal, then [[Robert William Keate]], were accepted by both parties as arbitrator, but the attempt then made to settle disagreements proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn spite of his dislike for their activities, Cetshwayo permitted European missionaries in Zululand. Though he did not harm or persecute{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=91}} the missionaries themselves, several converts were killed. The missionaries, for their part, were a source of hostile reports.{{sfn|Barthorp|2002|p=13}} While numerous Zulus of rival factions fled into Natal and some of the surrounding areas, Cetshwayo continued and maintained the peaceful relations with the Natal colonists that had prevailed for decades. Such was the political background when Cetshwayo became absolute ruler of the Zulus upon his father's death in 1873.\n\nAs ruler, Cetshwayo set about reviving the military methods of his uncle [[Shaka]] as far as possible.  He formed new [[age-set]] regiments and even succeeded in equipping his regiments with a few antiquated muskets and other outdated firearms.{{sfn|Barthorp|2002|p=15}} Most Zulu warriors were armed with an ''[[iklwa]]'' (the Zulu refinement of the ''[[assegai]]'' thrusting spear) and a shield made of cowhide.{{sfn|Archer|Ferris|Herwig|Travers|2008|p=462}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Lock|Quantrill|2002|p=62}} quote  John Shepstone, Acting Secretary for Native Affairs at the time on the Zulu army: saying \"Equipment: Each man carries his shield and assegais, and a kaross or blanket if he possesses one, he may also have a war dress of monkey skins or ox tails, this is all.\"}} The Zulu army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapons system. While some Zulus also had firearms, their marksmanship training was poor and the quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful.{{sfn|Knight|1996|pp=33, 38, 39}} The Zulu attitude towards firearms was that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the poltroon to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"{{sfn|Bourquin|1978}}\n\n==Boundary Commission and ultimatum==\n{{too many quotes|section|date=February 2020}}\nThe tension between Cetshwayo and the Transvaal over border disputes continued. Sir [[Theophilus Shepstone]], whom Cetshwayo regarded as his friend, had supported him in the border dispute, but in 1877 he led a small force into the Transvaal and persuaded the Boers to give up their independence. Shepstone became administrator of the Transvaal, and in that role saw the border dispute from the other side.{{sfn|Martineau|1895|p=251}} Shepstone claimed to have evidence supporting the Boer position but, ultimately, he failed to provide any. In a meeting with Zulu notables at Blood River in October 1877, Shepstone attempted to placate the Zulu with paternal speeches, however they were unconvinced and accused Shepstone of betraying them. Shepstone's subsequent reports to Carnarvon then began to paint the Zulu as an aggressive threat where he had previously presented Cetshwayo in a most favourable light.{{sfn|Gump|1996|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nIn February 1878 a commission was appointed by [[Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer|Henry Bulwer]], the lieutenant-governor of Natal since 1875, to report on the boundary question. The commission reported in July and found almost entirely in favour of the contention of the Zulu. However, Sir [[Sir Henry Bartle Frere, 1st Baronet|Henry Bartle Frere]], then high commissioner and still pressing forward with Carnarvon's federation plan, characterized the award as \"one-sided and unfair to the Boers\",{{efn|{{harvnb|Martineau|1895|p=242}} gives much of the chapter, without sarcasm\u2014or irony, to Bartle Frere's remarkable rationalizations in undermining the commission's conclusions.}} stipulated that on the land being given to the Zulu, the Boers living on it should be compensated if they left or protected if they remained.  In addition, Frere planned to  use the meeting on the boundary commission report with the Zulu representatives to also present a surprise [[ultimatum]] he had devised that would allow  British forces under Lord Chelmsford, which he had previously been instructed to use only in defense against a Zulu invasion of Natal, to instead invade Zululand. Three incidents occurred in late July, August and September which Frere seized upon as his ''[[casus belli]]'' and were the basis for the ultimatum to which Frere knew Cetshwayo could not comply,{{sfn|Spiers|2006|p=41}}{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=9}} giving Frere a pretext to attack the Zulu kingdom.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=261\u201362}}{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=11}}\n\nThe first two incidents related to the flight into Natal of two wives of Sihayo kaXonga and their subsequent seizure and execution by his brother and sons and were described thus:\n\n{{quote|A wife of the chief Sihayo had left him and escaped into Natal. She was followed [on 28 July 1878] by a party of Zulus, under Mehlokazulu, the chief son of Sihayo, and his brother, seized at the kraal where she had taken refuge, and carried back to Zululand, where she was put to death, in accordance with Zulu law...\n\nA week later the same young men, with two other brothers and an uncle, captured in like manner another refugee wife of Sihayo, in the company of the young man with whom she had fled. This woman was also carried back, and is supposed to have been put to death likewise; the young man with her although guilty in Zulu eyes of a most heinous crime, punishable with death, was safe from them on English soil; they did not touch him.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|p=196}}}}\n\nThe third incident occurred in September, when two men were detained while on a sand bank of the [[Thukela River]] near the Middle Drift. Sir Bartle Frere described this matter in a despatch to Sir [[Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn|Michael Hicks Beach]], who had replaced Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies:\n\n{{quote|Mr. Smith, a surveyor in the Colonial Engineer Department, was on duty inspecting the road down to the Tugela, near Fort Buckingham, which had been made a few years ago by order of Sir Garnet Wolseley, and accompanied by Mr. Deighton, a trader, resident at Fort Buckingham, went down to the ford across the Tugela. The stream was very low, and ran under the Zulu bank, but they were on this side of it, and had not crossed when they were surrounded by a body of 15 or 20 armed Zulus, made prisoners, and taken off with their horses, which were on the Natal side of the river, and roughly treated and threatened for some time; though, ultimately, at the instance of a headman who came up, they were released and allowed to depart.<ref name=\"bpp 1\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2222, No. 111: Frere to Hicks Beach, 6 October 1878.</ref>}}\n\nBy themselves, these incidents were flimsy grounds upon which to found an invasion of Zululand. Bulwer did not initially hold Cetshwayo responsible for what was clearly not a political act in the seizure and murder of the two women.\n\n{{quote|I have sent a message to the Zulu King to inform him of this act of violence and outrage by his subjects in Natal territory, and to request him to deliver Up to this Government to be tried for their offence, under the laws of the Colony, the persons of Mehlokazulu and Bekuzulu the two sons of Sirayo who were the leaders of the party.<ref name=\"bpp 2\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2220, No. 40: Bulwer to Hicks Beach, 9 August 1878.</ref>}}\n\nCetshwayo also treated the complaint rather lightly, responding\n{{quote|Cetywayo is sorry to have to acknowledge that the message brought by Umlungi is true, but he begs his Excellency will not take it in the light he sees the Natal Government seem to do, as what Sirayo\u2019s sons did he can only attribute to a rash act of boys who in the zeal for their father\u2019s house did not think of what they were doing. Cetywayo acknowledges that they deserve punishing, and he sends some of his [[izinduna]], who will follow Umlungi with his words. Cetywayo states that no acts of his subjects will make him quarrel with his fathers of the house of Shaka.<ref name=\"bpp 3\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2220, Enclosure in No. 89: Cetshwayo to Bulwer, 24 August 1879.</ref>}}\n\nThe original complaint carried to Cetshwayo from the lieutenant-governor was in the form of a request for the surrender of the culprits. The request was subsequently transformed by Sir Bartle Frere into a \"demand\".  Frere wrote to Hicks Beach, 30 September 1878:\n{{quote|Apart from whatever may be the general wish of the Zulu nation, it seems to me that the seizure of the two refugee women in British territory by an armed force crossing an unmistakable and well known boundary line, and carrying them off and murdering them with contemptuous disregard for the remonstrances of the Natal policemen, is itself an insult and a violation of British territory which cannot be passed over, and unless apologised and atoned for by compliance with the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s demands, that the leaders of the murderous gangs shall be given up to justice, it will be necessary to send to the Zulu King an ultimatum which must put an end to pacific relations with our neighbours.<ref name=\"bpp 4\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2220, No. 105, Frere to Hicks Beach, 30 September 1878.</ref>}}\n\nIn reply, in at least three dispatches, 17 October, 21 November and 18 December, Hicks Beach emphatically states that war is to be avoided and a British invasion of Zululand prohibited. From 21 November dispatch:\n{{quote|... Her Majesty's Government have arrived, it is my duty to impress upon you that in supplying these reinforcements it is the desire of Her Majesty's Government not to furnish means for a campaign of invasion and conquest, but to afford such protection as may be necessary at this juncture to the lives and property of the colonists. Though the present aspect of affairs is menacing in a high degree, I can by no means arrive at the conclusion that war with the Zulus should be unavoidable, and I am confident that you, in concert with Sir H. Bulwer, will use every effort to overcome the existing difficulties by judgment and forbearance, and to avoid an evil so much to be deprecated as a Zulu war.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=258\u201360}}}}\n\n[[File:Michael Hicks Beach, Lock & Whitfield woodburytype, 1876-84.jpg|thumb|150px|Hicks Beach]]\nAfter considerable discussion and exchanges of views between Sir Bartle Frere and Sir [[Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer]], it was decided to arrange a meeting with representatives of the Zulu king. The ostensible reason for this ''indaba'' was to present the findings of the long-awaited Boundary Commission to the Zulu people. The occasion was also to be used to present the king with an ultimatum.\n\nBy the time the ultimatum was presented, the two infractions by Sihayo\u2019s sons and the roughing up of Smith and Deighton were only part of the justification used, as several matters had arisen in the meantime.  One of these was Cetshwayo\u2019s apparent breaking of promises he had given to the then Mr Theophilus Shepstone at the king\u2019s \"coronation\" in 1872. This farcical piece of theatre had been agreed to by Cetshwayo simply to satisfy the wishes of Shepstone and meant nothing to the Zulu people. Indeed, his real Zulu installation had taken place several weeks earlier when he had been acclaimed by his izinduna.{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=79}}\nA second addition to the ultimatum, which seems almost like an afterthought, required the surrender of Mbelini kaMswati. Mbelini was the son of a [[Swazi people|Swazi]] king who unsuccessfully disputed the succession with his brother, resulting in his exile from the kingdom. He took refuge with Cetshwayo and was granted land in the region of the [[Intombe River]] in western Zululand. (It is entirely possible that Cetshwayo regarded him as a useful buffer between him and the Boers of the Transvaal.) Here, he took up residence on the Tafelberg<!---do not link to Tafelberg, which is Table Mountain at Cape Town--->, a flat-topped mountain overlooking the river. Something of a brigand, Mbelini made raids on anyone in his area, Boer and Zulu alike, accruing cattle and prisoners in the process. With the annexation of the Transvaal, Britain had also to deal with Mbelini and because Frere was convinced that the bandit chief was in the pay of the Zulu king, his surrender was included in the ultimatum. The light in which Mbelini was regarded is shown in a paragraph from a memorandum written by Sir Henry Bulwer:\n\n{{quote|The King disowned Umbilini\u2019s acts by saying that Umbilini had been giving him trouble, that he had left the Zulu country in order to wrest the Swazi chieftainship from his brother, the reigning Chief, and that if he returned he should kill him. But there is nothing to show that he has in any way punished him, and, on the contrary, it is quite certain that even if Umbilini did not act with the express orders of Cetywayo, he did so with the knowledge that what he was doing would be agreeable to the King.<ref name=\"bpp 5\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2260, Enclosure 2 in No. 6: Memorandum, 16 January 1879.</ref>}}\n\nFrere has been accused of chicanery by taking deliberate advantage of the length of time it took for correspondence to pass between South Africa and London to conceal his intentions from his political masters or at least defer giving them the necessary information until it was too late for them to act.  The first intimation to the British government of his intention to make 'demands' on the Zulu was in a private letter to Hicks Beach written on 14 October 1878. The letter only arrived in London on 16 November and by then messengers had already been despatched from Natal to the Zulu king to request the presence of a delegation at the Lower Tugela on 11 December for the purpose of receiving the Boundary Commission\u2019s findings. Had Hicks Beach then sent off a telegraph forbidding any action other than the announcement of the boundary award, it might have arrived in South Africa just in time to prevent the ultimatum being presented. No prohibition was sent and could hardly be expected to have been, for Hicks Beach had no means of knowing the urgency of the events that were in train. Nowhere in Frere\u2019s letter was there anything to indicate how soon he intended to act, nor was there anything to suggest how stringent his demands would be.\n\nIn January 1879 Hicks Beach wrote to Bartle Frere:\n{{quote|I may observe that the communications which had previously been received from you had not entirely prepared them (Her Majesty's Government) \"for the course which you have deemed it necessary to take. The representations made by Lord Chelmsford and yourself last autumn as to the urgent need of strengthening Her Majesty's forces in South Africa were based upon the imminent danger of an invasion of Natal by the Zulus, and the inadequate means at that time at your disposal for meeting it. In order to afford protection to the lives and property of the colonists, the reinforcements asked for were supplied, and, in informing you of the decision of Her Majesty's Government, I took the opportunity of impressing upon you the importance of using every effort to avoid war. But the terms which you have dictated to the Zulu king, however necessary to relieve the colony in future from an impending and increasing danger, are evidently such as he may not improbably refuse, even at the risk of war; and I regret that the necessity for immediate action should have appeared to you so imperative as to preclude you from incurring the delay which would have been involved in consulting Her Majesty's Government upon a subject of so much importance as the terms which Cetywayo should be required to accept before those terms were actually presented to the Zulu king.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=260\u201362}}}}\n\nHicks Beach had earlier admitted his helplessness with regard to the Frere's actions in a telling note to his Prime Minister:\n{{quote|I have impressed this [non-aggressive] view upon Sir B. Frere, both officially and privately, to the best of my power. But I cannot really control him without a telegraph   (I don\u2019t know that I could with one)   I feel it is as likely as not that he is at war with the Zulus at the present moment.{{sfn|Guy|1994|p=49}}}}\n\nFrere wanted to provoke a conflict with the Zulus and in that goal he succeeded. Cetshwayo rejected the demands of 11 December, by not responding by the end of the year. A concession was granted by Bartle Frere until 11 January 1879, after which Bartle Frere deemed a state of war to exist. The British forces intended for the defense of Natal had already been on the march with the intention to attack the Zulu kingdom. On 10 January they were poised on the border. On 11 January, they crossed the border and invaded Zululand.\n\n===Terms of the ultimatum===\nThe terms which were included in the ultimatum delivered to the representatives of King Cetshwayo on the banks of the Thukela river at the [[List of heritage sites in KwaZulu\u2013Natal|Ultimatum Tree]] on 11 December 1878.  No time was specified for compliance with item 4, twenty days were allowed for compliance with items 1\u20133, that is, until 31 December inclusive; ten days more were allowed for compliance with the remaining demands, items 4\u201313. The earlier time limits were subsequently altered so that all expired on 10 January 1879.\n# Surrender of Sihayo\u2019s three sons and brother to be tried by the Natal courts.\n# Payment of a fine of five hundred head of cattle for the outrages committed by the above and for Cetshwayo\u2019s delay in complying with the request of the Natal Government for the surrender of the offenders.\n# Payment of a hundred head of cattle for the offence committed against Messrs. Smith and Deighton.\n# Surrender of the Swazi chief Umbilini and others to be named hereafter, to be tried by the Transvaal courts.\n# Observance of the coronation promises.\n# That the Zulu army be disbanded and the men allowed to go home.\n# That the Zulu military system be discontinued and other military regulations adopted, to be decided upon after consultation with the Great Council and British Representatives.\n# That every man, when he comes to man\u2019s estate, shall be free to marry.\n# All missionaries and their converts, who until 1877 lived in Zululand, shall be allowed to return and reoccupy their stations.\n# All such missionaries shall be allowed to teach and any Zulu, if he chooses, shall be free to listen to their teaching.\n# A British Agent shall be allowed to reside in Zululand, who will see that the above provisions are carried out.\n# All disputes in which a missionary or European is concerned, shall be heard by the king in public and in presence of the Resident.\n# No sentence of expulsion from Zululand shall be carried out until it has been approved by the Resident.{{sfn|Martineau|1895|p=248}}\n\nTo ensure that there was no interference from London, Frere delayed informing the Colonial Office about his ultimatum until it was too late for it to be countermanded. The full text of his demands did not reach London until 2 January 1879. By then, Chelmsford had assembled an army of 18,000 men- redcoats, colonial volunteers and Natal African auxiliaries- along the Zululand border ready for the invasion. {{snf|Meredith|2007|p=92}}\n\nFor his part, Cetshwayo strenuously attempted to avoid war with the British and, should it occur,  limit its scope and effects. He ordered his troops to defend their country only if attacked and not to carry the war beyond its borders. He directed them to avoid killing  any of the invaders other than the regular British soldiers in their red coats.\n\n==British invasion and repulse==\n{{Main|Action at Sihayo's Kraal|Battle of Inyezane|Battle of Isandlwana|Battle of Rorke's Drift|Siege of Eshowe|Battle of Intombe|Battle of Hlobane|Battle of Kambula|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.35|Battle of Isandlwana painting by Charles Edwin Fripp (1854\u20131906)]]\n[[File:Military Map of Zulu Land.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British Army military map of Zulu Land, 1879]]\n\n<!---moved from lead, now needs integration here or deletion when it duplicates--->\nThe pretext for the war had its origins in border disputes between the Zulu leader, [[Cetshwayo]], and the [[Boer]]s in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] region.

In the event, Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main center column, now consisting of some 7,800 men comprising the previously called No. 3 Column and Durnford's No. 2 Column,{{efn|{{harvnb|Colenso|1880|pp=263\u201364}} gives 7,800: 1752 Imperial and Colonial troops and 6054 Native Contingent and 377 Conductors and Drivers for the Number 2 Column under Durnford and the Number 3 Column under Glynn which made up Chelmsford's Main Column.

Chelmsford's decision not to set up the British camp defensively, contrary to established doctrine, and ignoring information that the Zulus were close at hand were decisions that the British were soon to regret. The ensuing [[Battle of Isandlwana]] was the greatest victory that the Zulu kingdom would enjoy during the war. The British centre column was wrecked and its camp annihilated with heavy casualties as well as the loss of all its supplies, ammunition and transport. The defeat left Chelmsford no choice but to hastily retreat out of Zululand. In the battle's aftermath, a party of some 4,000 Zulu reserves mounted an unauthorised raid on the nearby British army border post of [[Rorke's Drift]] and were driven off after 10 hours of ferocious fighting.\n[[File:Guerriers zoulous.jpg|thumb|left|Zulu warriors, 1879 ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\nWhile the British central column under Chelmsford's command was thus engaged, the right flank column on the coast, under Colonel [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]], crossed the Tugela River, skirmished with a Zulu impi that was attempting to set up an ambush at the [[Siege of Eshowe#Prelude: Inyezane|Inyezane River]], and advanced as far as the deserted missionary station of Eshowe, which he set about fortifying. On learning of the disaster at Isandlwana, Pearson made plans to withdraw back beyond the Tugela River. However, before he had decided whether or not to put these plans into effect, the Zulu army managed to cut off his supply lines, and the [[Siege of Eshowe]] had begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the left flank column at Utrecht, under Colonel [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]], had originally been charged with occupying the Zulu tribes of north-west Zululand and preventing them from interfering with the British central column's advance on Ulundi. To this end Wood set up camp at Tinta's Kraal, just 10 miles south of [[Hlobane Mountain]], where a force of 4,000 Zulus had been spotted. He planned to attack them on 24 January, but on learning of the disaster at Isandlwana, he decided to withdraw back to the Kraal. Thus one month after the British invasion, only their left flank column remained militarily effective, and it was too weak to conduct a campaign alone. The first invasion of Zululand had been a failure.{{efn|{{harvnb|Laband|2009|p=5}} \"The Anglo-Zulu War is described in terms of the 1st invasion and 2nd invasion.\"}}\n\n[[File:Ntombe.jpg|thumb|200px|Battle of the Intombe river]]\nIt had never been Cetshwayo's intention to invade Natal, but to simply fight within the boundaries of the Zulu kingdom. Chelmsford used the next two months to regroup and build a fresh invading force with the initial intention of relieving Pearson at Eshowe. The British government rushed seven regiments of reinforcements to Natal, along with two artillery batteries.\n\nOn 12 March, an armed escort of stores marching to Luneberg, was defeated by about 500 Zulus at the [[Battle of Intombe]]; the British force suffered 80 killed{{efn|{{harvnb|Morris|1998|p=474}} gives 80 killed: 62 British soldiers, 3 European conductors and 15 native voorloopers.}} and all the stores were lost. The first troops arrived at Durban on 7 March. On the 29th a column, under Lord Chelmsford, consisting of 3,400 British and 2,300 African soldiers, marched to the relief of [[Eshowe]], entrenched camps being formed each night.\n\nChelmsford ordered Sir Evelyn Wood's troops to attack the abaQulusi Zulu stronghold in Hlobane. Lieutenant Colonel [[Redvers Henry Buller|Redvers Buller]], led the [[Battle of Hlobane|attack on Hlobane]] on 28 March. However, as the Zulu main army of 20,000 men approached to help their besieged tribesmen, the British force began a retreat which turned into a rout and were pursued by 1,000 Zulus of the abaQulusi who inflicted some 225 casualties on the British force.\n\nThe next day 20,000 Zulu warriors{{efn|{{harvnb|Colenso|1880|p=353}} notes \"The strength of the enemy was thought to be 20,000 of whom 1000 are supposed to have been killed.\".}}  attacked Wood's 2,068 men in a well-fortified camp at Kambula, apparently without Cetshwayo's permission. The British held them off in the [[Battle of Kambula]] and after five hours of heavy attacks the Zulus withdrew with heavy losses but were pursued by British mounted troops, who killed many more fleeing and wounded warriors. British losses amounted to 83 (28 killed and 55 wounded), while the Zulus lost up to 2,000 killed.{{efn|{{harvnb|Raugh|2011|p=5}}, gives 800 Zulu casualties. {{harvnb|Knight|1995|p=142 }} says, '785 [bodies] were collected from close by the camp. Many more lay out on the line of retreat where the slaughter had been heaviest... Perhaps as many as 2,000 died'.}} The effect of the battle of Kambula on the Zulu army was severe. Their commander Mnyamana tried to get the regiments to return to Ulundi but many demoralised warriors simply went home.{{sfn|Knight|1995|p=142 }}\n\n[[File:The burning of Ulundi.jpg|thumb|The burning of Ulundi]]\n\nWhile Woods was thus engaged, Chelmsford's column was marching on Eshowe. On 2 April this force was attacked en route at [[Battle of Gingindlovu|Gingindlovu]], the Zulu being repulsed. Their losses were heavy, estimated at 1,200 while the British only suffered two dead and 52 wounded. The next day they relieved Pearson's men. They evacuated Eshowe on 5 April, after which the Zulu forces burned it down.\n\n==Second invasion and the defeat of the Zulus==\n{{Main|Battle of Ulundi}}\n\n[[File:Last Sleep of the Brave.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Last Sleep of the Brave, 1879 ([[Alphonse de Neuville]])]]\n\nThe new start of the larger, heavily reinforced second invasion{{efn|{{harvnb|Raugh|2011|p=5}}\"Chelmsford...began his second invasion\". {{harvnb|Thompson|2006|p=75}} \"Thus ended the first British invasion of Zululand\". {{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=27}} has a map titled: \"First invasion of Zululand\". {{harvnb|Morris|1998|pp=498\u2013511}} has a chapter titled:\"The Second Invasion\".}} was not promising for the British. Despite their successes at Kambula, Gingindlovu and Eshowe, they were right back where they had started from at the beginning of January. Nevertheless, Chelmsford had a pressing reason to proceed with haste \u2013 Sir Garnet Wolseley was being sent to replace him, and he wanted to inflict a decisive defeat on Cetshwayo's forces before then. With yet more reinforcements arriving, soon to total 16,000 British  and 7,000 Native troops, Chelmsford reorganised his forces and again advanced into Zululand in June, this time with extreme caution building fortified camps all along the way to prevent any repeat of Isandlwana.\n\nOne of the early British casualties was the exiled heir to the French throne, [[Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial|Imperial Prince Napoleon Eugene]], who had volunteered to serve in the British army and was killed on 1 June while out with a reconnoitering party.\n\nCetshwayo, knowing that the newly reinforced British would be a formidable opponent, attempted to negotiate a peace treaty. Chelmsford was not open to negotiations, as he wished to restore his reputation before Wolseley relieved him of command, and he proceeded to the royal kraal of Ulundi, intending to defeat the main Zulu army. On 4 July, the armies clashed at the [[Battle of Ulundi]], and Cetshwayo's forces were decisively defeated.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Military history of South Africa}}\n\nAfter the battle of Ulundi the Zulu army dispersed, most of the leading chiefs tendered their submission, and [[Cetshwayo]] became a fugitive. Wolseley, having relieved Chelmsford after Ulundi, took over the final operations. On 28 August the king was captured and sent to [[Cape Town]] (It is said that scouts spotted the water-carriers of the king, distinctive because the water was carried above, not upon, their heads). His deposition was formally announced to the Zulu. Wolseley wasted no time in discarding Bartle Frere's confederation scheme and drew up a new scheme which divided Zululand into thirteen chiefdoms headed by compliant chiefs which ensured that the Zulus would no longer unite under a single king and made internal divisions and civil wars inevitable. The [[Shaka|dynasty of Shaka]] was deposed, and the Zulu country portioned among eleven Zulu chiefs, including [[Usibepu]], [[John Dunn (1833-1895)|John Dunn]], a white adventurer, and [[Hlubi]], a Basuto chief allied to the British in the war.\n\nChelmsford received a Knight Grand Cross of Bath, largely because of Ulundi, however, he was severely criticized by the Horse Guards investigation{{sfn|Lock|Quantrill|2002|loc=Ch 9}} and he would never serve in the field again.{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=99}} Bartle Frere was relegated to a minor post in [[Cape Town]].\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War, Bishop Colenso interceded on behalf of Cetshwayo with the British government and succeeded in getting him released from [[Robben Island]] and returned to Zululand in 1883.\n\nA Resident ([[Melmoth Osborn]]) was appointed to be the channel of communication between the chiefs and the British government. This arrangement led to much bloodshed and disturbance, and in 1882 the British government determined to restore Cetshwayo to power. In the meantime, however, blood feuds had been engendered between the chiefs [[Usibepu]] (Zibebu) and Hamu on the one side and the tribes who supported the ex-king and his family on the other. Cetshwayo's party (who now became known as the Usuthu) suffered severely at the hands of the two chiefs, who were aided by a band of white [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].\n\nWhen Cetshwayo was restored Usibepu was left in possession of his territory, while Dunn's land and that of the Basuto chief (the country between the [[Tugela River]] and the Umhlatuzi, i.e., adjoining Natal) was constituted a reserve, in which locations were to be provided for Zulu unwilling to serve the restored king. This new arrangement proved as futile as had Wolseley's. Usibepu, having created a formidable force of well-armed and trained warriors, and being left in independence on the borders of Cetshwayo's territory, viewed with displeasure the re-installation of his former king, and Cetshwayo was desirous of humbling his relative. A collision very soon took place; Usibepu's forces were victorious, and on 22 July 1883, led by a troop of mounted Boer mercenary troops, he made a sudden descent upon Cetshwayo's kraal at Ulundi, which he destroyed, massacring such of the inmates of both sexes as could not save themselves by flight. The king escaped, though wounded, into [[Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal|Nkandla]] forest. After appeals to [[Melmoth Osborn]] he moved to [[Eshowe]], where he died soon after.\n\n==Last veterans==\n* Colour Sergeant (later Lieutenant-Colonel) [[Frank Bourne]], [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]] (1854\u20131945).

Following [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s successful introduction of [[Constitution Act, 1867|federation in Canada]], it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] in South Africa. In 1874, [[Henry Bartle Frere|Sir Henry Bartle Frere]] was sent to South Africa as [[High Commissioner]] for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the [[South African Republic]] and the Kingdom of [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] and its army.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 8.</ref>\n\nFrere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government{{sfn|Spiers|2006|p=41}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=9}} states \"By late 1878 Frere had manipulated a diplomatic crisis with the Zulus...\" }} and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an [[Anglo-Zulu War#Terms of the Ultimatum|ultimatum]] on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king [[Cetshwayo]] with which the Zulu king could not comply, including disbanding his army and abandoning key cultural traditions.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=261\u201362}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=11}} notes \"... an ultimatum with which, Frere knew, they could not possibly comply\". }} Bartle Frere then sent [[Frederic Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] to invade Zululand after this ultimatum was not met.{{sfn|Morris|1998|pp= 291\u201392}} The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], followed by the defeat of a large Zulu army at [[Rorke's Drift]] by a small force of British troops. The war eventually resulted in a British victory and the end of the Zulu nation's dominance of the region.\n\n==Background==\n===British Empire===\nBy the 1850s the British Empire had colonies in southern Africa bordering on various [[Boer]] settlements, native African kingdoms such as the Zulus, the [[Basotho]] and numerous indigenous tribal areas and states. Various interactions with these followed an expansionist policy. [[Cape Colony]] had been formed after the [[Anglo\u2013Dutch Treaty of 1814]] permanently ceded the Dutch colony of [[Cape Town]] to Britain, and its territory expanded very substantially through the 19th century. [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in south-eastern Africa was proclaimed a British colony on 4 May 1843 after the British government had annexed the [[Boer]] [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]]. Matters were brought to a head when three sons and a brother of the Zulu chief Sirayo organized a raid into Natal and carried off two women who were under British protection.\n\nThe discovery of diamonds in 1867 near the [[Vaal River]], some {{convert|550|mi}} northeast of [[Cape Town]], ended the isolation of the Boers in the interior and changed South African history. The discovery triggered a [[diamond rush]] that attracted people from all over the world, which turned [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] into a town of 50,000 within five years and drew the attention of British imperial interests. In the 1870s, the British annexed [[West Griqualand]], site of the Kimberley diamond discoveries.\n\nIn 1874 [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], who had successfully brought about federation in Canada in 1867, thought that a similar scheme might work in South Africa. The South African plan called for a ruling white minority over a black majority, which would provide a large pool of cheap labour for the British sugar plantations and mines.{{sfn|Gump|1996|pp=73\u201393}} Carnarvon, in an attempt to extend British influence in 1875, approached the Boer states of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[Transvaal Republic]] and tried to organize a federation of the British and Boer territories, but the Boer leaders turned him down.\n\nIn 1877, Sir [[Bartle Frere]] was made [[High Commissioner]] for [[Southern Africa]] by Lord Carnarvon. Carnarvon appointed Frere to the position on the understanding that he would work to enforce Carnarvon's confederation plan and, in return, Frere could then become the first British governor of a federated southern African [[dominion]]. Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner to bring this plan about. One of the obstacles to such a scheme was the presence of the independent states of the [[South African Republic]], informally known as the Transvaal Republic, and the Kingdom of [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]]. Bartle Frere wasted no time in putting the scheme forward and manufacturing a [[casus belli]] against the Zulu by exaggerating the significance of a number of recent incidents.{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=91}}\n[[File:BartleFrere.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Bartle Frere]]]]\nBy 1877, Sir [[Theophilus Shepstone]], the British Secretary for Native Affairs in Natal, annexed the Transvaal Republic for Britain using a special warrant. The Transvaal Boers objected but as long as the Zulu threat remained, found themselves between two threats; they feared that if they took up arms to resist the British annexation actively, King [[Cetshwayo]] and the Zulus would take the opportunity to attack. However, the successive British annexations, and in particular the annexation of West Griqualand, caused a climate of simmering unease for the Boer republics.\n\nShepstone railed against the disruptive effect of allowing Cetshwayo's regime to remain in place. \"Zulu power\", he said, \"is the root and real strength of all native difficulties in South Africa\". In December 1877, he wrote to Carnarvon \"Cetshwayo is the secret hope of every petty independent chief hundreds of miles from him who feels a desire that his color shall prevail, and it will not be until this hope is destroyed that they will make up their minds to submit to the rule of civilization\". Earlier in October 1877, Shepstone had attended a meeting with Zulu leaders near the Blood River to resolve the land dispute between the Zulus and the Boers. He suggested a compromise with the Boers and the meeting broke up without clear resolutions. He turned against the Zulus with vengeance, saying he had come into possession of \"the most incontrovertible, overwhelming and clear evidence\" never previously disclosed, for supporting the claims of the Boers. He rejected Zulu claims as \"characterized by lying and treachery to an extent that I could not have believed even savages are capable of\". {{snf|Meredith|2007|p=89}} \n\nShepstone, in his capacity as British governor of Natal, had expressed concerns about the Zulu army under King Cetshwayo and the potential threat to Natal \u2014 especially given the adoption by some of the Zulus of old muskets and other out-of-date firearms. In his new role of Administrator of the Transvaal, he was now responsible for protecting the Transvaal and had direct involvement in the Zulu border dispute from the side of the Transvaal. Persistent Boer representations and [[Paul Kruger]]'s diplomatic manoeuvrings added to the pressure. There were incidents involving Zulu paramilitary actions on either side of the Transvaal/Natal border, and Shepstone increasingly began to regard King Cetshwayo, as having permitted such \"outrages\", and to be in a \"defiant mood\". King Cetshwayo now found no defender in Natal save the bishop of Natal, [[John Colenso]].\n\nColenso advocated for native Africans in Natal and Zululand who had been unjustly treated by the colonial regime in Natal. In 1874 he took up the cause of [[Langalibalele]] and the Hlubi and Ngwe tribes in representations to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon. Langalibalele had been falsely accused of rebellion in 1873 and, following a charade of a trial, was found guilty and imprisoned on [[Robben Island]]. In taking the side of Langalibalele against the colonial regime in Natal and Theophilus Shepstone, the Secretary for Native Affairs, Colenso found himself even further estranged from colonial society in Natal.\n\nBishop Colenso's concern about the misleading information that was being provided to the Colonial Secretary in London by Shepstone and the Governor of Natal prompted him to champion the cause of the Zulus against Boer oppression and official encroachments. He was a prominent critic of Sir Bartle Frere's efforts to depict the Zulu kingdom as a threat to Natal. Colenso's campaigns revealed the racialist foundation underpinning the colonial regime in Natal and made him enemies among the colonists.\n\n[[British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s Tory administration in London did not want a war with the Zulus. \"The fact is,\" wrote [[Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn|Sir Michael Hicks Beach]], who would replace Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies, in November 1878, \"that matters in Eastern Europe and India&nbsp;... wore so serious an aspect that we cannot have a Zulu war in addition to other greater and too possible troubles.\" However, Sir Bartle Frere had already been into the [[Cape Colony]] as governor and High Commissioner since 1877 with the brief of creating a Confederation of South Africa from the various British colonies, Boer Republics and native states and his plans were well advanced. He had concluded that the powerful Zulu kingdom stood in the way of this, and so was receptive to Shepstone's arguments that King Cetshwayo and his Zulu army posed a threat to the peace of the region. Preparations for a British invasion of the Zulu kingdom had been underway for months. In December 1878, notwithstanding the reluctance of the British government to start yet another colonial war, Frere presented Cetshwayo with an ultimatum that the Zulu army be disbanded and the Zulus accept a British resident. This was unacceptable to the Zulus as it effectively meant that Cetshwayo, had he agreed, would have lost his throne.\n\n===Zulu Kingdom===\n[[File:Cetshwayo-c1875.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of [[Cetshwayo kaMpande]], c.&nbsp;1875]]\n[[Shaka Zulu]], the first Zulu king, had, through war and conquest, built the small Zulu tribe into the Zulu Kingdom which by 1825 encompassed an area of around {{convert|11500|sqmi}}. In 1828 he was assassinated at [[Shaka Memorial|Dukuza]] by one of his [[Induna|inDunas]] and two of his half-brothers, one of whom, [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]], succeeded him as king. By the 1830s  migrating Boers came into conflict with the Zulu Kingdom, then ruled by Dingane. Dingane suffered a crushing defeat on 16 December 1838, when he attacked a group of 470 Voortrekker settlers led by [[Andries Pretorius|Pretorius]] at the [[Battle of Blood River]]. Dingane's half brother, [[Mpande kaSenzangakhona]], then defected with some 17,000 followers and allied with the Boers against Dingane. Dingane was assassinated and Mpande became king of the Zulu empire.\n\nIn 1839, the Boer  [[Voortrekkers]], under Pretorius, formed the Boer [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]], south of the Tugela, and west of the British settlement of Port Natal (now Durban). Mpande and Pretorius maintained peaceful relations. However, in 1842, war broke out between the British and the Boers, resulting in the British annexation of Natalia. Mpande shifted his allegiance to the British, and remained on good terms with them.\n\n[[File:Mpande.jpg|thumb|210px|King [[Mpande kaSenzangakhona|Mpande]]]]\nIn 1843, Mpande ordered a purge of perceived dissidents within his kingdom. This resulted in numerous deaths, and the fleeing of thousands of refugees into neighbouring areas, including the British-controlled Natal. Many of these refugees fled with cattle, the main measure of the Zulu wealth. Mpande began raiding the surrounding areas, culminating in the invasion of [[Swaziland]] in 1852. However, the British pressured him into withdrawing, which he did shortly afterwards. At this time, a battle for the succession broke out between two of Mpande's sons, Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi. This culminated in 1856 with the [[Battle of Ndondakusuka]], which left Mbuyazi dead. Cetshwayo then set about usurping his father's authority. When Mpande died of old age in 1872, Cetshwayo took over as ruler.\n\nIn 1861, Umtonga, a brother of [[Cetshwayo]], and another son of Zulu king [[Mpande]], fled to the Utrecht district, and Cetshwayo assembled an army on that frontier. According to claims later brought forward by the [[Boer]]s, Cetshwayo offered the farmers a strip of land along the border if they would surrender his brother. The Boers complied on the condition that Umtonga's life was spared, and in 1861 Mpande signed a deed transferring this land to the Boers. The south boundary of the land added to Utrecht ran from [[Rorke's Drift]] on the Buffalo to a point on the [[Pongola River]].\n\n[[File:Angas - Zoeloe vrouens brou bier.png|thumb|Zulu village, c. 1849]]\nThe boundary was beaconed in 1864, but when in 1865 Umtonga fled from [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] to [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], Cetshwayo, seeing that he had lost his part of the bargain (for he feared that Umtonga might be used to supplant him, as Mpande had been used to supplant [[Dingane]]), caused the beacon to be removed, and also claimed the land ceded by the [[Swazi people|Swazis]] to [[Lydenburg]]. The Zulus asserted that the Swazis were their vassals and therefore had no right to part with this territory. During the year a [[Boer Commando|Boer commando]] under [[Paul Kruger]] and an army under Cetshwayo were posted to defend the newly acquired Utrecht border. The Zulu forces took back their land north of the Pongola. Questions were also raised as to the validity of the documents signed by the Zulus concerning the Utrecht strip; in 1869 the services of the lieutenant-governor of Natal, then [[Robert William Keate]], were accepted by both parties as arbitrator, but the attempt then made to settle disagreements proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn spite of his dislike for their activities, Cetshwayo permitted European missionaries in Zululand. Though he did not harm or persecute{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=91}} the missionaries themselves, several converts were killed. The missionaries, for their part, were a source of hostile reports.{{sfn|Barthorp|2002|p=13}} While numerous Zulus of rival factions fled into Natal and some of the surrounding areas, Cetshwayo continued and maintained the peaceful relations with the Natal colonists that had prevailed for decades. Such was the political background when Cetshwayo became absolute ruler of the Zulus upon his father's death in 1873.\n\nAs ruler, Cetshwayo set about reviving the military methods of his uncle [[Shaka]] as far as possible.  He formed new [[age-set]] regiments and even succeeded in equipping his regiments with a few antiquated muskets and other outdated firearms.{{sfn|Barthorp|2002|p=15}} Most Zulu warriors were armed with an ''[[iklwa]]'' (the Zulu refinement of the ''[[assegai]]'' thrusting spear) and a shield made of cowhide.{{sfn|Archer|Ferris|Herwig|Travers|2008|p=462}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Lock|Quantrill|2002|p=62}} quote  John Shepstone, Acting Secretary for Native Affairs at the time on the Zulu army: saying \"Equipment: Each man carries his shield and assegais, and a kaross or blanket if he possesses one, he may also have a war dress of monkey skins or ox tails, this is all.\"}} The Zulu army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapons system. While some Zulus also had firearms, their marksmanship training was poor and the quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful.{{sfn|Knight|1996|pp=33, 38, 39}} The Zulu attitude towards firearms was that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the poltroon to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"{{sfn|Bourquin|1978}}\n\n==Boundary Commission and ultimatum==\n{{too many quotes|section|date=February 2020}}\nThe tension between Cetshwayo and the Transvaal over border disputes continued. Sir [[Theophilus Shepstone]], whom Cetshwayo regarded as his friend, had supported him in the border dispute, but in 1877 he led a small force into the Transvaal and persuaded the Boers to give up their independence. Shepstone became administrator of the Transvaal, and in that role saw the border dispute from the other side.{{sfn|Martineau|1895|p=251}} Shepstone claimed to have evidence supporting the Boer position but, ultimately, he failed to provide any. In a meeting with Zulu notables at Blood River in October 1877, Shepstone attempted to placate the Zulu with paternal speeches, however they were unconvinced and accused Shepstone of betraying them. Shepstone's subsequent reports to Carnarvon then began to paint the Zulu as an aggressive threat where he had previously presented Cetshwayo in a most favourable light.{{sfn|Gump|1996|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nIn February 1878 a commission was appointed by [[Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer|Henry Bulwer]], the lieutenant-governor of Natal since 1875, to report on the boundary question. The commission reported in July and found almost entirely in favour of the contention of the Zulu. However, Sir [[Sir Henry Bartle Frere, 1st Baronet|Henry Bartle Frere]], then high commissioner and still pressing forward with Carnarvon's federation plan, characterized the award as \"one-sided and unfair to the Boers\",{{efn|{{harvnb|Martineau|1895|p=242}} gives much of the chapter, without sarcasm\u2014or irony, to Bartle Frere's remarkable rationalizations in undermining the commission's conclusions.}} stipulated that on the land being given to the Zulu, the Boers living on it should be compensated if they left or protected if they remained.  In addition, Frere planned to  use the meeting on the boundary commission report with the Zulu representatives to also present a surprise [[ultimatum]] he had devised that would allow  British forces under Lord Chelmsford, which he had previously been instructed to use only in defense against a Zulu invasion of Natal, to instead invade Zululand. Three incidents occurred in late July, August and September which Frere seized upon as his ''[[casus belli]]'' and were the basis for the ultimatum to which Frere knew Cetshwayo could not comply,{{sfn|Spiers|2006|p=41}}{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=9}} giving Frere a pretext to attack the Zulu kingdom.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=261\u201362}}{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=11}}\n\nThe first two incidents related to the flight into Natal of two wives of Sihayo kaXonga and their subsequent seizure and execution by his brother and sons and were described thus:\n\n{{quote|A wife of the chief Sihayo had left him and escaped into Natal. She was followed [on 28 July 1878] by a party of Zulus, under Mehlokazulu, the chief son of Sihayo, and his brother, seized at the kraal where she had taken refuge, and carried back to Zululand, where she was put to death, in accordance with Zulu law...\n\nA week later the same young men, with two other brothers and an uncle, captured in like manner another refugee wife of Sihayo, in the company of the young man with whom she had fled. This woman was also carried back, and is supposed to have been put to death likewise; the young man with her although guilty in Zulu eyes of a most heinous crime, punishable with death, was safe from them on English soil; they did not touch him.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|p=196}}}}\n\nThe third incident occurred in September, when two men were detained while on a sand bank of the [[Thukela River]] near the Middle Drift. Sir Bartle Frere described this matter in a despatch to Sir [[Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn|Michael Hicks Beach]], who had replaced Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies:\n\n{{quote|Mr. Smith, a surveyor in the Colonial Engineer Department, was on duty inspecting the road down to the Tugela, near Fort Buckingham, which had been made a few years ago by order of Sir Garnet Wolseley, and accompanied by Mr. Deighton, a trader, resident at Fort Buckingham, went down to the ford across the Tugela. The stream was very low, and ran under the Zulu bank, but they were on this side of it, and had not crossed when they were surrounded by a body of 15 or 20 armed Zulus, made prisoners, and taken off with their horses, which were on the Natal side of the river, and roughly treated and threatened for some time; though, ultimately, at the instance of a headman who came up, they were released and allowed to depart.<ref name=\"bpp 1\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2222, No. 111: Frere to Hicks Beach, 6 October 1878.</ref>}}\n\nBy themselves, these incidents were flimsy grounds upon which to found an invasion of Zululand. Bulwer did not initially hold Cetshwayo responsible for what was clearly not a political act in the seizure and murder of the two women.\n\n{{quote|I have sent a message to the Zulu King to inform him of this act of violence and outrage by his subjects in Natal territory, and to request him to deliver Up to this Government to be tried for their offence, under the laws of the Colony, the persons of Mehlokazulu and Bekuzulu the two sons of Sirayo who were the leaders of the party.<ref name=\"bpp 2\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2220, No. 40: Bulwer to Hicks Beach, 9 August 1878.</ref>}}\n\nCetshwayo also treated the complaint rather lightly, responding\n{{quote|Cetywayo is sorry to have to acknowledge that the message brought by Umlungi is true, but he begs his Excellency will not take it in the light he sees the Natal Government seem to do, as what Sirayo\u2019s sons did he can only attribute to a rash act of boys who in the zeal for their father\u2019s house did not think of what they were doing. Cetywayo acknowledges that they deserve punishing, and he sends some of his [[izinduna]], who will follow Umlungi with his words. Cetywayo states that no acts of his subjects will make him quarrel with his fathers of the house of Shaka.<ref name=\"bpp 3\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2220, Enclosure in No. 89: Cetshwayo to Bulwer, 24 August 1879.</ref>}}\n\nThe original complaint carried to Cetshwayo from the lieutenant-governor was in the form of a request for the surrender of the culprits. The request was subsequently transformed by Sir Bartle Frere into a \"demand\".  Frere wrote to Hicks Beach, 30 September 1878:\n{{quote|Apart from whatever may be the general wish of the Zulu nation, it seems to me that the seizure of the two refugee women in British territory by an armed force crossing an unmistakable and well known boundary line, and carrying them off and murdering them with contemptuous disregard for the remonstrances of the Natal policemen, is itself an insult and a violation of British territory which cannot be passed over, and unless apologised and atoned for by compliance with the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s demands, that the leaders of the murderous gangs shall be given up to justice, it will be necessary to send to the Zulu King an ultimatum which must put an end to pacific relations with our neighbours.<ref name=\"bpp 4\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2220, No. 105, Frere to Hicks Beach, 30 September 1878.</ref>}}\n\nIn reply, in at least three dispatches, 17 October, 21 November and 18 December, Hicks Beach emphatically states that war is to be avoided and a British invasion of Zululand prohibited. From 21 November dispatch:\n{{quote|... Her Majesty's Government have arrived, it is my duty to impress upon you that in supplying these reinforcements it is the desire of Her Majesty's Government not to furnish means for a campaign of invasion and conquest, but to afford such protection as may be necessary at this juncture to the lives and property of the colonists. Though the present aspect of affairs is menacing in a high degree, I can by no means arrive at the conclusion that war with the Zulus should be unavoidable, and I am confident that you, in concert with Sir H. Bulwer, will use every effort to overcome the existing difficulties by judgment and forbearance, and to avoid an evil so much to be deprecated as a Zulu war.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=258\u201360}}}}\n\n[[File:Michael Hicks Beach, Lock & Whitfield woodburytype, 1876-84.jpg|thumb|150px|Hicks Beach]]\nAfter considerable discussion and exchanges of views between Sir Bartle Frere and Sir [[Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer]], it was decided to arrange a meeting with representatives of the Zulu king. The ostensible reason for this ''indaba'' was to present the findings of the long-awaited Boundary Commission to the Zulu people. The occasion was also to be used to present the king with an ultimatum.\n\nBy the time the ultimatum was presented, the two infractions by Sihayo\u2019s sons and the roughing up of Smith and Deighton were only part of the justification used, as several matters had arisen in the meantime.  One of these was Cetshwayo\u2019s apparent breaking of promises he had given to the then Mr Theophilus Shepstone at the king\u2019s \"coronation\" in 1872. This farcical piece of theatre had been agreed to by Cetshwayo simply to satisfy the wishes of Shepstone and meant nothing to the Zulu people. Indeed, his real Zulu installation had taken place several weeks earlier when he had been acclaimed by his izinduna.{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=79}}\nA second addition to the ultimatum, which seems almost like an afterthought, required the surrender of Mbelini kaMswati. Mbelini was the son of a [[Swazi people|Swazi]] king who unsuccessfully disputed the succession with his brother, resulting in his exile from the kingdom. He took refuge with Cetshwayo and was granted land in the region of the [[Intombe River]] in western Zululand. (It is entirely possible that Cetshwayo regarded him as a useful buffer between him and the Boers of the Transvaal.) Here, he took up residence on the Tafelberg<!---do not link to Tafelberg, which is Table Mountain at Cape Town--->, a flat-topped mountain overlooking the river. Something of a brigand, Mbelini made raids on anyone in his area, Boer and Zulu alike, accruing cattle and prisoners in the process. With the annexation of the Transvaal, Britain had also to deal with Mbelini and because Frere was convinced that the bandit chief was in the pay of the Zulu king, his surrender was included in the ultimatum. The light in which Mbelini was regarded is shown in a paragraph from a memorandum written by Sir Henry Bulwer:\n\n{{quote|The King disowned Umbilini\u2019s acts by saying that Umbilini had been giving him trouble, that he had left the Zulu country in order to wrest the Swazi chieftainship from his brother, the reigning Chief, and that if he returned he should kill him. But there is nothing to show that he has in any way punished him, and, on the contrary, it is quite certain that even if Umbilini did not act with the express orders of Cetywayo, he did so with the knowledge that what he was doing would be agreeable to the King.<ref name=\"bpp 5\">British Parliamentary Papers, C. 2260, Enclosure 2 in No. 6: Memorandum, 16 January 1879.</ref>}}\n\nFrere has been accused of chicanery by taking deliberate advantage of the length of time it took for correspondence to pass between South Africa and London to conceal his intentions from his political masters or at least defer giving them the necessary information until it was too late for them to act.  The first intimation to the British government of his intention to make 'demands' on the Zulu was in a private letter to Hicks Beach written on 14 October 1878. The letter only arrived in London on 16 November and by then messengers had already been despatched from Natal to the Zulu king to request the presence of a delegation at the Lower Tugela on 11 December for the purpose of receiving the Boundary Commission\u2019s findings. Had Hicks Beach then sent off a telegraph forbidding any action other than the announcement of the boundary award, it might have arrived in South Africa just in time to prevent the ultimatum being presented. No prohibition was sent and could hardly be expected to have been, for Hicks Beach had no means of knowing the urgency of the events that were in train. Nowhere in Frere\u2019s letter was there anything to indicate how soon he intended to act, nor was there anything to suggest how stringent his demands would be.\n\nIn January 1879 Hicks Beach wrote to Bartle Frere:\n{{quote|I may observe that the communications which had previously been received from you had not entirely prepared them (Her Majesty's Government) \"for the course which you have deemed it necessary to take. The representations made by Lord Chelmsford and yourself last autumn as to the urgent need of strengthening Her Majesty's forces in South Africa were based upon the imminent danger of an invasion of Natal by the Zulus, and the inadequate means at that time at your disposal for meeting it. In order to afford protection to the lives and property of the colonists, the reinforcements asked for were supplied, and, in informing you of the decision of Her Majesty's Government, I took the opportunity of impressing upon you the importance of using every effort to avoid war. But the terms which you have dictated to the Zulu king, however necessary to relieve the colony in future from an impending and increasing danger, are evidently such as he may not improbably refuse, even at the risk of war; and I regret that the necessity for immediate action should have appeared to you so imperative as to preclude you from incurring the delay which would have been involved in consulting Her Majesty's Government upon a subject of so much importance as the terms which Cetywayo should be required to accept before those terms were actually presented to the Zulu king.{{sfn|Colenso|1880|pp=260\u201362}}}}\n\nHicks Beach had earlier admitted his helplessness with regard to the Frere's actions in a telling note to his Prime Minister:\n{{quote|I have impressed this [non-aggressive] view upon Sir B. Frere, both officially and privately, to the best of my power. But I cannot really control him without a telegraph   (I don\u2019t know that I could with one)   I feel it is as likely as not that he is at war with the Zulus at the present moment.{{sfn|Guy|1994|p=49}}}}\n\nFrere wanted to provoke a conflict with the Zulus and in that goal he succeeded. Cetshwayo rejected the demands of 11 December, by not responding by the end of the year. A concession was granted by Bartle Frere until 11 January 1879, after which Bartle Frere deemed a state of war to exist. The British forces intended for the defense of Natal had already been on the march with the intention to attack the Zulu kingdom. On 10 January they were poised on the border. On 11 January, they crossed the border and invaded Zululand.\n\n===Terms of the ultimatum===\nThe terms which were included in the ultimatum delivered to the representatives of King Cetshwayo on the banks of the Thukela river at the [[List of heritage sites in KwaZulu\u2013Natal|Ultimatum Tree]] on 11 December 1878.  No time was specified for compliance with item 4, twenty days were allowed for compliance with items 1\u20133, that is, until 31 December inclusive; ten days more were allowed for compliance with the remaining demands, items 4\u201313. The earlier time limits were subsequently altered so that all expired on 10 January 1879.\n# Surrender of Sihayo\u2019s three sons and brother to be tried by the Natal courts.\n# Payment of a fine of five hundred head of cattle for the outrages committed by the above and for Cetshwayo\u2019s delay in complying with the request of the Natal Government for the surrender of the offenders.\n# Payment of a hundred head of cattle for the offence committed against Messrs. Smith and Deighton.\n# Surrender of the Swazi chief Umbilini and others to be named hereafter, to be tried by the Transvaal courts.\n# Observance of the coronation promises.\n# That the Zulu army be disbanded and the men allowed to go home.\n# That the Zulu military system be discontinued and other military regulations adopted, to be decided upon after consultation with the Great Council and British Representatives.\n# That every man, when he comes to man\u2019s estate, shall be free to marry.\n# All missionaries and their converts, who until 1877 lived in Zululand, shall be allowed to return and reoccupy their stations.\n# All such missionaries shall be allowed to teach and any Zulu, if he chooses, shall be free to listen to their teaching.\n# A British Agent shall be allowed to reside in Zululand, who will see that the above provisions are carried out.\n# All disputes in which a missionary or European is concerned, shall be heard by the king in public and in presence of the Resident.\n# No sentence of expulsion from Zululand shall be carried out until it has been approved by the Resident.{{sfn|Martineau|1895|p=248}}\n\nTo ensure that there was no interference from London, Frere delayed informing the Colonial Office about his ultimatum until it was too late for it to be countermanded. The full text of his demands did not reach London until 2 January 1879. By then, Chelmsford had assembled an army of 18,000 men- redcoats, colonial volunteers and Natal African auxiliaries- along the Zululand border ready for the invasion. {{snf|Meredith|2007|p=92}}\n\nFor his part, Cetshwayo strenuously attempted to avoid war with the British and, should it occur,  limit its scope and effects. He ordered his troops to defend their country only if attacked and not to carry the war beyond its borders. He directed them to avoid killing  any of the invaders other than the regular British soldiers in their red coats.\n\n==British invasion and repulse==\n{{Main|Action at Sihayo's Kraal|Battle of Inyezane|Battle of Isandlwana|Battle of Rorke's Drift|Siege of Eshowe|Battle of Intombe|Battle of Hlobane|Battle of Kambula|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.35|Battle of Isandlwana painting by Charles Edwin Fripp (1854\u20131906)]]\n[[File:Military Map of Zulu Land.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British Army military map of Zulu Land, 1879]]\n\n<!---moved from lead, now needs integration here or deletion when it duplicates--->\nThe pretext for the war had its origins in border disputes between the Zulu leader, [[Cetshwayo]], and the [[Boer]]s in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] region.

In the event, Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main center column, now consisting of some 7,800 men comprising the previously called No. 3 Column and Durnford's No. 2 Column,{{efn|{{harvnb|Colenso|1880|pp=263\u201364}} gives 7,800: 1752 Imperial and Colonial troops and 6054 Native Contingent and 377 Conductors and Drivers for the Number 2 Column under Durnford and the Number 3 Column under Glynn which made up Chelmsford's Main Column. The strength of the entire invasion force is given as a total of 16,506 for the five columns: 6,669 Imperial and colonial troops: 9,035 troops in the native contingent; 802 Drivers, etc.}} under his direct command. He moved his troops from [[Pietermaritzburg]] to a forward camp at Helpmekaar, past [[Greytown (KwaZulu-Natal)|Greytown]]. On 9 January 1879 they moved to [[Rorke's Drift]], and early on 11 January commenced crossing the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo River]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]].{{sfn|Giliomee|Mbenga|2007}} Three columns were to invade Zululand, from the Lower Tugela, [[Rorke's Drift]], and Utrecht respectively, their objective being [[Ulundi]], the royal capital.\n\nWhile Cetshwayo's army numbered perhaps 35,000 men, it was essentially a militia force which could be called out in time of national danger.{{efn|{{harvnb|Knight|1996|p=11}} states \"they were a part-time citizen army, and were armed primarily with traditional weapons\".}} It had a very limited logistical capacity and could only stay in the field a few weeks before the troops would be obliged to return to their civilian duties.{{sfn|Knight|2005|p=8}} Zulu warriors were armed primarily with ''[[Assegai]]'' thrusting spears, known in Zulu as ''[[iklwa]]'', clubs, some throwing spears and shields made of cowhide.{{efn|{{harvnb|Archer|Ferris|Herwig|Travers|2008|p=462}} state \"They had a national army of twenty-five thousand men equipped with cowhide shields, assegais and clubs.}}{{sfn|Lock|Quantrill|2002|p=62}}\n\nThe initial entry of all three columns was unopposed. On 22 January the centre column, which had advanced from Rorke's Drift, was encamped near [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]]; on the morning of that day Lord Chelmsford split his forces and moved out to support a reconnoitering party, leaving the camp in charge of Colonel [[Henry Pulleine|Pulleine]]. The British were outmanoeuvred by the main Zulu army nearly 20,000 strong led by [[Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]]. Chelmsford was lured eastward with much of his centre column by a Zulu diversionary force while the main [[Impi]] attacked his camp. Chelmsford's decision not to set up the British camp defensively, contrary to established doctrine, and ignoring information that the Zulus were close at hand were decisions that the British were soon to regret. The ensuing [[Battle of Isandlwana]] was the greatest victory that the Zulu kingdom would enjoy during the war. The British centre column was wrecked and its camp annihilated with heavy casualties as well as the loss of all its supplies, ammunition and transport. The defeat left Chelmsford no choice but to hastily retreat out of Zululand. In the battle's aftermath, a party of some 4,000 Zulu reserves mounted an unauthorised raid on the nearby British army border post of [[Rorke's Drift]] and were driven off after 10 hours of ferocious fighting.\n[[File:Guerriers zoulous.jpg|thumb|left|Zulu warriors, 1879 ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\nWhile the British central column under Chelmsford's command was thus engaged, the right flank column on the coast, under Colonel [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]], crossed the Tugela River, skirmished with a Zulu impi that was attempting to set up an ambush at the [[Siege of Eshowe#Prelude: Inyezane|Inyezane River]], and advanced as far as the deserted missionary station of Eshowe, which he set about fortifying. On learning of the disaster at Isandlwana, Pearson made plans to withdraw back beyond the Tugela River. However, before he had decided whether or not to put these plans into effect, the Zulu army managed to cut off his supply lines, and the [[Siege of Eshowe]] had begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the left flank column at Utrecht, under Colonel [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]], had originally been charged with occupying the Zulu tribes of north-west Zululand and preventing them from interfering with the British central column's advance on Ulundi. To this end Wood set up camp at Tinta's Kraal, just 10 miles south of [[Hlobane Mountain]], where a force of 4,000 Zulus had been spotted. He planned to attack them on 24 January, but on learning of the disaster at Isandlwana, he decided to withdraw back to the Kraal. Thus one month after the British invasion, only their left flank column remained militarily effective, and it was too weak to conduct a campaign alone. The first invasion of Zululand had been a failure.{{efn|{{harvnb|Laband|2009|p=5}} \"The Anglo-Zulu War is described in terms of the 1st invasion and 2nd invasion.\"}}\n\n[[File:Ntombe.jpg|thumb|200px|Battle of the Intombe river]]\nIt had never been Cetshwayo's intention to invade Natal, but to simply fight within the boundaries of the Zulu kingdom. Chelmsford used the next two months to regroup and build a fresh invading force with the initial intention of relieving Pearson at Eshowe. The British government rushed seven regiments of reinforcements to Natal, along with two artillery batteries.\n\nOn 12 March, an armed escort of stores marching to Luneberg, was defeated by about 500 Zulus at the [[Battle of Intombe]]; the British force suffered 80 killed{{efn|{{harvnb|Morris|1998|p=474}} gives 80 killed: 62 British soldiers, 3 European conductors and 15 native voorloopers.}} and all the stores were lost. The first troops arrived at Durban on 7 March. On the 29th a column, under Lord Chelmsford, consisting of 3,400 British and 2,300 African soldiers, marched to the relief of [[Eshowe]], entrenched camps being formed each night.\n\nChelmsford ordered Sir Evelyn Wood's troops to attack the abaQulusi Zulu stronghold in Hlobane. Lieutenant Colonel [[Redvers Henry Buller|Redvers Buller]], led the [[Battle of Hlobane|attack on Hlobane]] on 28 March. However, as the Zulu main army of 20,000 men approached to help their besieged tribesmen, the British force began a retreat which turned into a rout and were pursued by 1,000 Zulus of the abaQulusi who inflicted some 225 casualties on the British force.\n\nThe next day 20,000 Zulu warriors{{efn|{{harvnb|Colenso|1880|p=353}} notes \"The strength of the enemy was thought to be 20,000 of whom 1000 are supposed to have been killed.\".}}  attacked Wood's 2,068 men in a well-fortified camp at Kambula, apparently without Cetshwayo's permission. The British held them off in the [[Battle of Kambula]] and after five hours of heavy attacks the Zulus withdrew with heavy losses but were pursued by British mounted troops, who killed many more fleeing and wounded warriors. British losses amounted to 83 (28 killed and 55 wounded), while the Zulus lost up to 2,000 killed.{{efn|{{harvnb|Raugh|2011|p=5}}, gives 800 Zulu casualties. {{harvnb|Knight|1995|p=142 }} says, '785 [bodies] were collected from close by the camp. Many more lay out on the line of retreat where the slaughter had been heaviest... Perhaps as many as 2,000 died'.}} The effect of the battle of Kambula on the Zulu army was severe. Their commander Mnyamana tried to get the regiments to return to Ulundi but many demoralised warriors simply went home.{{sfn|Knight|1995|p=142 }}\n\n[[File:The burning of Ulundi.jpg|thumb|The burning of Ulundi]]\n\nWhile Woods was thus engaged, Chelmsford's column was marching on Eshowe. On 2 April this force was attacked en route at [[Battle of Gingindlovu|Gingindlovu]], the Zulu being repulsed. Their losses were heavy, estimated at 1,200 while the British only suffered two dead and 52 wounded. The next day they relieved Pearson's men. They evacuated Eshowe on 5 April, after which the Zulu forces burned it down.\n\n==Second invasion and the defeat of the Zulus==\n{{Main|Battle of Ulundi}}\n\n[[File:Last Sleep of the Brave.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Last Sleep of the Brave, 1879 ([[Alphonse de Neuville]])]]\n\nThe new start of the larger, heavily reinforced second invasion{{efn|{{harvnb|Raugh|2011|p=5}}\"Chelmsford...began his second invasion\". {{harvnb|Thompson|2006|p=75}} \"Thus ended the first British invasion of Zululand\". {{harvnb|Knight|2003|p=27}} has a map titled: \"First invasion of Zululand\". {{harvnb|Morris|1998|pp=498\u2013511}} has a chapter titled:\"The Second Invasion\".}} was not promising for the British. Despite their successes at Kambula, Gingindlovu and Eshowe, they were right back where they had started from at the beginning of January. Nevertheless, Chelmsford had a pressing reason to proceed with haste \u2013 Sir Garnet Wolseley was being sent to replace him, and he wanted to inflict a decisive defeat on Cetshwayo's forces before then. With yet more reinforcements arriving, soon to total 16,000 British  and 7,000 Native troops, Chelmsford reorganised his forces and again advanced into Zululand in June, this time with extreme caution building fortified camps all along the way to prevent any repeat of Isandlwana.\n\nOne of the early British casualties was the exiled heir to the French throne, [[Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial|Imperial Prince Napoleon Eugene]], who had volunteered to serve in the British army and was killed on 1 June while out with a reconnoitering party.\n\nCetshwayo, knowing that the newly reinforced British would be a formidable opponent, attempted to negotiate a peace treaty. Chelmsford was not open to negotiations, as he wished to restore his reputation before Wolseley relieved him of command, and he proceeded to the royal kraal of Ulundi, intending to defeat the main Zulu army. On 4 July, the armies clashed at the [[Battle of Ulundi]], and Cetshwayo's forces were decisively defeated.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Military history of South Africa}}\n\nAfter the battle of Ulundi the Zulu army dispersed, most of the leading chiefs tendered their submission, and [[Cetshwayo]] became a fugitive. Wolseley, having relieved Chelmsford after Ulundi, took over the final operations. On 28 August the king was captured and sent to [[Cape Town]] (It is said that scouts spotted the water-carriers of the king, distinctive because the water was carried above, not upon, their heads). His deposition was formally announced to the Zulu. Wolseley wasted no time in discarding Bartle Frere's confederation scheme and drew up a new scheme which divided Zululand into thirteen chiefdoms headed by compliant chiefs which ensured that the Zulus would no longer unite under a single king and made internal divisions and civil wars inevitable. The [[Shaka|dynasty of Shaka]] was deposed, and the Zulu country portioned among eleven Zulu chiefs, including [[Usibepu]], [[John Dunn (1833-1895)|John Dunn]], a white adventurer, and [[Hlubi]], a Basuto chief allied to the British in the war.\n\nChelmsford received a Knight Grand Cross of Bath, largely because of Ulundi, however, he was severely criticized by the Horse Guards investigation{{sfn|Lock|Quantrill|2002|loc=Ch 9}} and he would never serve in the field again.{{sfn|Gump|1996|p=99}} Bartle Frere was relegated to a minor post in [[Cape Town]].\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War, Bishop Colenso interceded on behalf of Cetshwayo with the British government and succeeded in getting him released from [[Robben Island]] and returned to Zululand in 1883.\n\nA Resident ([[Melmoth Osborn]]) was appointed to be the channel of communication between the chiefs and the British government. This arrangement led to much bloodshed and disturbance, and in 1882 the British government determined to restore Cetshwayo to power. In the meantime, however, blood feuds had been engendered between the chiefs [[Usibepu]] (Zibebu) and Hamu on the one side and the tribes who supported the ex-king and his family on the other. Cetshwayo's party (who now became known as the Usuthu) suffered severely at the hands of the two chiefs, who were aided by a band of white [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].\n\nWhen Cetshwayo was restored Usibepu was left in possession of his territory, while Dunn's land and that of the Basuto chief (the country between the [[Tugela River]] and the Umhlatuzi, i.e., adjoining Natal) was constituted a reserve, in which locations were to be provided for Zulu unwilling to serve the restored king. This new arrangement proved as futile as had Wolseley's. Usibepu, having created a formidable force of well-armed and trained warriors, and being left in independence on the borders of Cetshwayo's territory, viewed with displeasure the re-installation of his former king, and Cetshwayo was desirous of humbling his relative. A collision very soon took place; Usibepu's forces were victorious, and on 22 July 1883, led by a troop of mounted Boer mercenary troops, he made a sudden descent upon Cetshwayo's kraal at Ulundi, which he destroyed, massacring such of the inmates of both sexes as could not save themselves by flight. The king escaped, though wounded, into [[Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal|Nkandla]] forest. After appeals to [[Melmoth Osborn]] he moved to [[Eshowe]], where he died soon after.\n\n==Last veterans==\n* Colour Sergeant (later Lieutenant-Colonel) [[Frank Bourne]], [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]] (1854\u20131945).

The first was in 1974, which moved the goal posts from the goal line to the back of the end zone, adding ten yards to the kick distance, and awarded the ball to the defense on a missed kick at the spot where the ball was snapped. This was changed in 1994 to the spot of the kick. Then, in 1977, the [[1977 NFL season#Major rule changes|NFL added a rule]], informally known as the \"Tom Dempsey Rule\", that \"any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname|title=Rules of the Name, or How the Emmitt Rule Became the Emmitt Rule,|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211145916/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname|work=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|location=[[Grand Island, New York]]|publisher=PFRA, LLC|archivedate=December 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf|title=Official NFL Rulebook 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216075609/http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf|work=[[The News Tribune]]|publisher=[[McClatchy]]|location=[[Tacoma, Washington]]|archivedate=February 16, 2010}}See Rule 5, Section 3, Article 3 Paragraph (g)</ref>\n\n==Career regular season statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align: right; font-size: 90%; width: 800px;\"\n''Career high/best '''bold'''''\n|-\n!

The first was in 1974, which moved the goal posts from the goal line to the back of the end zone, adding ten yards to the kick distance, and awarded the ball to the defense on a missed kick at the spot where the ball was snapped. This was changed in 1994 to the spot of the kick. Then, in 1977, the [[1977 NFL season#Major rule changes|NFL added a rule]], informally known as the \"Tom Dempsey Rule\", that \"any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname|title=Rules of the Name, or How the Emmitt Rule Became the Emmitt Rule,|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211145916/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname|work=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|location=[[Grand Island, New York]]|publisher=PFRA, LLC|archivedate=December 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf|title=Official NFL Rulebook 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216075609/http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf|work=[[The News Tribune]]|publisher=[[McClatchy]]|location=[[Tacoma, Washington]]|archivedate=February 16, 2010}}See Rule 5, Section 3, Article 3 Paragraph (g)</ref>\n\n==Career regular season statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align: right; font-size: 90%; width: 800px;\"\n''Career high/best '''bold'''''\n|-\n!

Hunter was born in [[Petrolia, Ontario]], but grew up in [[Oil Springs, Ontario]], and was one of three brothers, with [[Dave Hunter|Dave]] and [[Mark Hunter (ice hockey)|Mark]], to play in the NHL.\n\n==NHL career==\n\n===Quebec Nordiques===\nHe was selected 41st overall by the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]] and played seven seasons in Quebec.\n\nAccording to his former [[Quebec Nordiques]] coach [[Michel Bergeron (hockey coach)|Michel Bergeron]], even though Hunter was nicknamed the \"Nuisance\" on ice (''La Petite Peste'' in French), he was known to be \"humble\" in the dressing room and a sort of \"gentleman\", close to all the players. He was the \"perfect player\", always the first to arrive at practice and ready to do all his best for the team. Thanks to his charisma, Hunter was a fan favourite in both Quebec and Washington. His leaving Quebec was seen as an obvious \"mistake\" linked to the team's future decline.<ref>\"Les Nordiques, notre \u00e9quipe\", video documentary (French), Imavision, 1998 (see also DVD reed. 2006).</ref>\n\nHunter was traded to the [[Washington Capitals]] along with [[Clint Malarchuk]] in return for two players and a 1987 first-round draft pick the Nordiques then used to select [[Joe Sakic]].\n\n===Washington Capitals===\nIn the [[1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Washington vs. New York Islanders|1993 Patrick Division Semifinals]] between the Capitals and [[1992-93 New York Islanders season|New York Islanders]], Hunter led his team with seven postseason goals. That performance, however, was marred by an illegal and vicious check on Islanders' star [[Pierre Turgeon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138705/index.htm|title=Dale Hunter|work=Sports Illustrated|date=December 6, 1993|last=Crothers|first=Time|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref> This illegal check occurred after Turgeon had stolen an errant pass of Hunter's and subsequently scored.  As Turgeon was celebrating, Hunter came up from behind and checked an unsuspecting Turgeon into the boards. As a result of the incident, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94 season]] as part of new commissioner [[Gary Bettman]]'s effort to crack down on violent play.\n\nHe broke the 1,000 points barrier (and is the NHL record holder for requiring the most games to do so by a forward, at 1,308, as well having the most penalty minutes when reaching that scoring milestone). He played in the [[1997 NHL All-Star Game|NHL All-Star game]] in 1997. He also served as team captain from 1994 to 1999.\n\nIN 1998 he led the fourth seeded Capitals to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, defeating the [[1997-98 Boston Bruins season|Boston Bruins]], [[1997-98 Ottawa Senators season|Ottawa Senators]], and [[1997-98 Buffalo Sabres season|Buffalo Sabres]]. In the [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|finals]], the Capitals were swept by the defending Cup champions, the [[1997-98 Detroit Red Wings season|Detroit Red Wings]], with the first three games being decided by one goal.\n\n===Colorado Avalanche===\nHunter finished off his career with the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the successor to the Nordiques, and helped the team to reach the Western Conference finals, losing in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion [[Dallas Stars]]. On that team, he often played on the same line as two other renowned [[pest (ice hockey)|pest]] role players -- [[Claude Lemieux]] and [[Theoren Fleury]].\n\n==Post-NHL==\n[[File:Washington Capitals retired numbers red.jpg|thumb|The Capitals retired Hunter's number in 2000.]]\nHunter's sweater number (#32) was retired by the Capitals on March 11, 2000. During the ceremony, the Capitals presented Hunter with one of the penalty boxes from the [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]] (the Capitals former home arena), symbolic of his exceptional amount of time served for penalties.\n\nIn 2000, Hunter and his brother, [[Mark Hunter (ice hockey)|Mark]]\u2014also a former NHL player\u2014teamed up with Dale's former teammate on the Nordiques, [[Basil McRae]], to buy the [[London Knights]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. Dale became team president and head coach. He led the Knights to the [[2005 Memorial Cup|2005]] and [[2016 Memorial Cup]]. On January 1, 2006, the Hunter brothers were named to the 2006 Mayor's New Year's Honours List for Sports by the City of London, Ontario. Hunter's older brother [[Dave Hunter]] is also a former NHLer. His son [[Dylan Hunter]] is an assistant coach for the Knights and his other son Tucker also played for the London Knights before pursuing his education at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nOn November 28, 2011, Hunter resigned his position as head coach of the Knights to take the same position with the Washington Capitals, succeeding [[Bruce Boudreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capitals.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=603491&navid=DL%7cWSH%7chome#|title=Capitals Name Dale Hunter Head Coach|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> His brother Mark then took over as Knights coach. Hunter's defense oriented system caused some conflict with star [[Alexander Ovechkin]] but it helped the struggling Capitals make the playoffs, where they upset the defending Stanley Cup champions [[Boston Bruins]] in the first round before being eliminated by the [[New York Rangers]], both postseason series going to seven games. On May 14, 2012, Hunter announced he was not returning to coach the Capitals in the 2012-2013 season, choosing instead to return to the London Knights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/14/gm-hunter-wont-return-capitals-coach/%7cWSH%7chome# |title=Hunter won't return as Capitals coach |date=May 14, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 2019, Hockey Canada named Hunter as the Head Coach for Canada\u2019s National Junior Team at the [[2020 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|2020 IIHF World Junior Championship]].<ref>Canada\u2019s National Junior Team and Canada\u2019s National Men\u2019s Summer Under-18 Team at the 2020 IIHF World Junior Championship</ref>  Hunter guided the team to the gold medal with a dramatic come-from-behind victory over Russia in the final game.<ref>https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/team-canada/men/junior/2019-20/world-championship/stats/game-summary?gameid=2677</ref>\n\n==Accolades and controversy==\nLate in the deciding Game 6 of the [[1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Washington vs. New York Islanders|1993 Patrick Division Semifinals]] between the Capitals and [[New York Islanders]], [[Pierre Turgeon]] stole the puck from Hunter and scored, putting the game out of reach. Hunter, who was trailing Turgeon on the play, checked Turgeon well after the goal as he started to celebrate. Turgeon sustained a separated shoulder from the hit, causing him to miss all but Game 7 against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the second round, as well as most of the series against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the conference finals.  New [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]], who had earlier promised to crack down on violence, suspended Hunter for the first 21 games of the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]]\u2014at the time, the longest suspension in league history for an on-ice incident (in terms of games missed).

The Capitals retired his No.&nbsp;32 jersey. Hunter is the only NHL player ever to score over 1,000 points and rack up over 3,000 penalty minutes (1,020 points and 3,565 PIMs over 1,407 NHL games).\n\nHe scored in overtime for Quebec in Game 5 of their 1982 opening round best-of-five series vs. the [[1981-82 montreal canadiens season|Montreal Canadiens]], and in 1988 scoring against [[Ron Hextall]] on a breakaway in overtime for Washington in Game 7 of their opening round best-of-7 series vs. the [[1987-88 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia Flyers]], making Hunter the first player in NHL history to score two overtime series-clinching goals in the playoffs.\n\nIn July 2006, Hunter was arrested and charged with [[Driving under the influence|DUI]].<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=148299&x=articles&s=knights\n   |title=Knights coach charged with drunk driving\n   |first=April|last=Kemick \n   |date=August 20, 2006}}</ref> The charges were dropped when the presiding judge ruled that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated for unlawful detention and being denied his right to his lawyer.\n\nIn September 2005, Hunter was suspended by the Ontario Hockey League for four games after a player left the bench to initiate a fight in an exhibition game.\n\nOn January 20, 2006, Hunter was suspended for two games and his team was fined $5,000 for Hunter's off ice abuse of the officials. In May 2006, Hunter was fined $5,000 by the OHL for criticizing officials after the Knights were eliminated from the playoffs in four straight games. In September 2006, Hunter was suspended by the OHL for two games after forward Matt Davis left the bench to engage in a fight during a game; OHL rules state that there is an automatic suspension for

Hunter was born in [[Petrolia, Ontario]], but grew up in [[Oil Springs, Ontario]], and was one of three brothers, with [[Dave Hunter|Dave]] and [[Mark Hunter (ice hockey)|Mark]], to play in the NHL.\n\n==NHL career==\n\n===Quebec Nordiques===\nHe was selected 41st overall by the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]] and played seven seasons in Quebec.\n\nAccording to his former [[Quebec Nordiques]] coach [[Michel Bergeron (hockey coach)|Michel Bergeron]], even though Hunter was nicknamed the \"Nuisance\" on ice (''La Petite Peste'' in French), he was known to be \"humble\" in the dressing room and a sort of \"gentleman\", close to all the players. He was the \"perfect player\", always the first to arrive at practice and ready to do all his best for the team. Thanks to his charisma, Hunter was a fan favourite in both Quebec and Washington. His leaving Quebec was seen as an obvious \"mistake\" linked to the team's future decline.<ref>\"Les Nordiques, notre \u00e9quipe\", video documentary (French), Imavision, 1998 (see also DVD reed. 2006).</ref>\n\nHunter was traded to the [[Washington Capitals]] along with [[Clint Malarchuk]] in return for two players and a 1987 first-round draft pick the Nordiques then used to select [[Joe Sakic]].\n\n===Washington Capitals===\nIn the [[1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Washington vs. New York Islanders|1993 Patrick Division Semifinals]] between the Capitals and [[1992-93 New York Islanders season|New York Islanders]], Hunter led his team with seven postseason goals. That performance, however, was marred by an illegal and vicious check on Islanders' star [[Pierre Turgeon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138705/index.htm|title=Dale Hunter|work=Sports Illustrated|date=December 6, 1993|last=Crothers|first=Time|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref> This illegal check occurred after Turgeon had stolen an errant pass of Hunter's and subsequently scored.  As Turgeon was celebrating, Hunter came up from behind and checked an unsuspecting Turgeon into the boards. As a result of the incident, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94 season]] as part of new commissioner [[Gary Bettman]]'s effort to crack down on violent play.\n\nHe broke the 1,000 points barrier (and is the NHL record holder for requiring the most games to do so by a forward, at 1,308, as well having the most penalty minutes when reaching that scoring milestone). He played in the [[1997 NHL All-Star Game|NHL All-Star game]] in 1997. He also served as team captain from 1994 to 1999.\n\nIN 1998 he led the fourth seeded Capitals to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, defeating the [[1997-98 Boston Bruins season|Boston Bruins]], [[1997-98 Ottawa Senators season|Ottawa Senators]], and [[1997-98 Buffalo Sabres season|Buffalo Sabres]]. In the [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|finals]], the Capitals were swept by the defending Cup champions, the [[1997-98 Detroit Red Wings season|Detroit Red Wings]], with the first three games being decided by one goal.\n\n===Colorado Avalanche===\nHunter finished off his career with the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the successor to the Nordiques, and helped the team to reach the Western Conference finals, losing in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion [[Dallas Stars]]. On that team, he often played on the same line as two other renowned [[pest (ice hockey)|pest]] role players -- [[Claude Lemieux]] and [[Theoren Fleury]].\n\n==Post-NHL==\n[[File:Washington Capitals retired numbers red.jpg|thumb|The Capitals retired Hunter's number in 2000.]]\nHunter's sweater number (#32) was retired by the Capitals on March 11, 2000. During the ceremony, the Capitals presented Hunter with one of the penalty boxes from the [[Capital Centre]] (the Capitals former home arena), symbolic of his exceptional amount of time served for penalties.\n\nIn 2000, Hunter and his brother, [[Mark Hunter (ice hockey)|Mark]]\u2014also a former NHL player\u2014teamed up with Dale's former teammate on the Nordiques, [[Basil McRae]], to buy the [[London Knights]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. Dale became team president and head coach. He led the Knights to the [[2005 Memorial Cup|2005]] and [[2016 Memorial Cup]]. On January 1, 2006, the Hunter brothers were named to the 2006 Mayor's New Year's Honours List for Sports by the City of London, Ontario. Hunter's older brother [[Dave Hunter]] is also a former NHLer. His son [[Dylan Hunter]] is an assistant coach for the Knights and his other son Tucker also played for the London Knights before pursuing his education at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nOn November 28, 2011, Hunter resigned his position as head coach of the Knights to take the same position with the Washington Capitals, succeeding [[Bruce Boudreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capitals.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=603491&navid=DL%7cWSH%7chome#|title=Capitals Name Dale Hunter Head Coach|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> His brother Mark then took over as Knights coach. Hunter's defense oriented system caused some conflict with star [[Alexander Ovechkin]] but it helped the struggling Capitals make the playoffs, where they upset the defending Stanley Cup champions [[Boston Bruins]] in the first round before being eliminated by the [[New York Rangers]], both postseason series going to seven games. On May 14, 2012, Hunter announced he was not returning to coach the Capitals in the 2012-2013 season, choosing instead to return to the London Knights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/14/gm-hunter-wont-return-capitals-coach/%7cWSH%7chome# |title=Hunter won't return as Capitals coach |date=May 14, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 2019, Hockey Canada named Hunter as the Head Coach for Canada\u2019s National Junior Team at the [[2020 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|2020 IIHF World Junior Championship]].<ref>Canada\u2019s National Junior Team and Canada\u2019s National Men\u2019s Summer Under-18 Team at the 2020 IIHF World Junior Championship</ref>  Hunter guided the team to the gold medal with a dramatic come-from-behind victory over Russia in the final game.<ref>https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/team-canada/men/junior/2019-20/world-championship/stats/game-summary?gameid=2677</ref>\n\n==Accolades and controversy==\nLate in the deciding Game 6 of the [[1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Washington vs. New York Islanders|1993 Patrick Division Semifinals]] between the Capitals and [[New York Islanders]], [[Pierre Turgeon]] stole the puck from Hunter and scored, putting the game out of reach. Hunter, who was trailing Turgeon on the play, checked Turgeon well after the goal as he started to celebrate. Turgeon sustained a separated shoulder from the hit, causing him to miss all but Game 7 against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the second round, as well as most of the series against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the conference finals.  New [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]], who had earlier promised to crack down on violence, suspended Hunter for the first 21 games of the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]]\u2014at the time, the longest suspension in league history for an on-ice incident (in terms of games missed). Years later, Hunter admitted that he'd gone too far.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/20314-A-Trip-Through-Hockey-History-Remembering-the-Dale-Hunter-Cheapshot\n |title=A Trip Through Hockey History: Remembering the Dale Hunter Cheapshot\n |first=Eric|last=Kuzmiak\n |date=April 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWith amassing a staggering 3565 penalty minutes, Hunter currently has the second-most penalty minutes in NHL history, after [[Tiger Williams|Dave \"Tiger\" Williams]] (although Hunter played 1,407 games to Williams' 962). The Capitals retired his No.&nbsp;32 jersey. Hunter is the only NHL player ever to score over 1,000 points and rack up over 3,000 penalty minutes (1,020 points and 3,565 PIMs over 1,407 NHL games).\n\nHe scored in overtime for Quebec in Game 5 of their 1982 opening round best-of-five series vs. the [[1981-82 montreal canadiens season|Montreal Canadiens]], and in 1988 scoring against [[Ron Hextall]] on a breakaway in overtime for Washington in Game 7 of their opening round best-of-7 series vs. the [[1987-88 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia Flyers]], making Hunter the first player in NHL history to score two overtime series-clinching goals in the playoffs.\n\nIn July 2006, Hunter was arrested and charged with [[Driving under the influence|DUI]].<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=148299&x=articles&s=knights\n   |title=Knights coach charged with drunk driving\n   |first=April|last=Kemick \n   |date=August 20, 2006}}</ref> The charges were dropped when the presiding judge ruled that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated for unlawful detention and being denied his right to his lawyer.\n\nIn September 2005, Hunter was suspended by the Ontario Hockey League for four games after a player left the bench to initiate a fight in an exhibition game.\n\nOn January 20, 2006, Hunter was suspended for two games and his team was fined $5,000 for Hunter's off ice abuse of the officials. In May 2006, Hunter was fined $5,000 by the OHL for criticizing officials after the Knights were eliminated from the playoffs in four straight games. In September 2006, Hunter was suspended by the OHL for two games after forward Matt Davis left the bench to engage in a fight during a game; OHL rules state that there is an automatic suspension for both the player and the coach if a player leaves the bench to become involved in an altercation.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Playing career===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"

He has [[Sentience|a mind of his own]] and is capable of driving himself, and is often a serious contender in [[auto racing]] competitions. Throughout most of the franchise, Herbie is distinguished by red, white and blue [[racing stripe]]s from front to back bumper, a racing-style number '''53''' on the front luggage compartment lid, doors, and engine lid, and a yellow-on-black '63 [[Vehicle registration plates of California|California license plate]] with the registration \"'''OFP 857'''\".\n\n== History ==\n{{In-universe|section|date=January 2019}}\nHerbie's origins as a racing car are firmly established in ''[[The Love Bug]]'' [[1968 in film|(1968)]]. Before the events of the film, he was bought from the showroom of Peter Thorndyke ([[David Tomlinson]]) by [[San Francisco]] [[socialite]] Mrs. Van Luit for her upstairs maid, but returned him shortly afterwards due to reliability problems. He was then purchased by [[race driver]] Jim Douglas ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), who had earlier stood up for Herbie when Thorndyke kicked him. Tennessee Steinmetz ([[Buddy Hackett]]), Jim's best friend and housemate, names the car \"Herbie\" after his uncle Herb, a [[middleweight]] [[boxer]] whose nose got shaped more and more like a Volkswagen Beetle, then makes Herbie a racing car.\n\nIn ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' [[1974 in film|(1974)]], Herbie has been left to Tennessee's widowed aunt, Mrs. Steinmetz ([[Helen Hayes]]). Mrs. Steinmetz and her displaced neighbor, Nicole Harris ([[Stefanie Powers]]), try to save her house from being bulldozed by [[Alonzo Hawk]] ([[Keenan Wynn]]) with the help of Herbie. During the film, it is explained that after several successful races with Herbie, Douglas entered foreign racing circuits while his sidekick Tennessee is residing in [[Tibet]] to help his ailing instructor. During the film, it is revealed that Herbie has befriended other sentient VW Beetles and these team up with him to defeat Hawk, and we learn of the existence of other sentient objects (briefly mentioned by Tennessee in the first film), such as Mrs. Steinmetz's self-playing [[jukebox]].\n\nBy ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' [[1977 in film|(1977)]], Douglas enters Herbie in the [[Monte Carlo Rally|Trans-France Race]] and recruits mechanic friend Wheely Applegate ([[Don Knotts]]) to assist him. Herbie falls in love with a [[Lancia Montecarlo|Lancia Scorpion]] named Giselle (who is also sentient, although Jim, Herbie and Wheely are the first to discover it) and Douglas with her driver Diane Darcy ([[Julie Sommars]]). Herbie also finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when the stolen ''Etoile de Joie'' diamond is hidden in his gas tank.\n\nIn ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'' [[1980 in film|(1980)]], Douglas has retired from racing after Monte Carlo and leaves Herbie to his nephew, Pete Stancheck ([[Stephen W. Burns]]), who plans to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Primeo. In the interim, Herbie befriends an [[orphan]] named Paco ([[Joaquin Garay, III]]), with whom he wreaks havoc with onboard the cruise ship the ''Sun Princess'', prompting the overzealous Captain Blythe ([[Harvey Korman]]) to force Herbie to \"walk the plank\". Having fallen into the ocean, Herbie is rescued by Paco and disguised as a taxi, later to stop a gang of [[con artist]]s from stealing ancient [[Inca]] gold. Early in their partnership, Paco gives Herbie the nickname \"Ocho\" because he can't understand Herbie talking through his horn. Ocho is the Spanish word for the number 8; purportedly because the digits 5 and 3 in Herbie's racing number, 53, were combined to produce \"8\" (5+3 = 8) and possibly to rhyme with \"Vocho\", the Beetle's colloquial name in Mexico.\n\nAfter the Mexico debacle, Douglas takes in Herbie and opens a driving school in the TV series ''[[Herbie, the Love Bug (TV series)|Herbie, the Love Bug]]''. There, Douglas meets a woman named Susan MacLane and her three kids: Julie, Matthew, and Robbie, with the kids become friends to Herbie, But; however, a business man named Randy Bigelow want to get rid of Herbie and Douglas and get Susan back after they broke up during his wedding.\n\nHank Cooper ([[Bruce Campbell]]) becomes the owner of Herbie in the 1997 [[television film|made-for-television movie]] ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]''. Here, Herbie's origins as a sentient Volkswagen Beetle are explained: an elderly German engineer named Dr. Gustav Stumpfel was building Herbie when a picture of his deceased wife fell into a vat of molten metal; with Stumpfel's love for her animating Herbie. During the film, Stumpfel is forced to build an evil Volkswagen counterpart to Herbie, \"Horace the Hate Bug\", from a sample of Herbie's original metal. Horace's personality is influenced by the narcissism of Herbie's former owner Simon when he has a picture of himself dropped into the metal vats, and kills Herbie during the film. Cooper buries Herbie, but the return of Jim Douglas sets Cooper to rebuild the fallen Love Bug (with the help of the repentant Dr. Stumpfel) and have him race against Simon and Horace. In this race, Herbie ultimately divides himself in half (as in the original film) to win the race.\n\nOver the years Herbie is passed down from owner to owner (including someone named \"Maxx\", who left his driver suit inside the hood), competing in many races, until he starts losing constantly to newer and faster cars, and later found by a [[tow truck]] driver in a garage and carried to Crazy Dave's scrapyard and, later, bought by Maggie Peyton ([[Lindsay Lohan]]) in ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'' [[2005 in film|(2005)]]. He is later modified, becoming a 2002-cc-engined car and participating in various races, from a [[demolition derby]] to the final race of the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Nextel Cup Series]]. Herbie eventually falls in love with a [[Volkswagen New Beetle]] (which, at the end, is revealed to be a sentient car too).\n\n== Appearance in media ==\n\nHerbie has been the central character of five theatrical-release films, a made-for-TV movie, and a short-lived television series.\n\n=== Film series ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film\n|-\n!

Action! Stunt Show Spectacular|Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show]]'' at Disney theme parks, but was later replaced by [[Lightning McQueen]].\n* Herbie has had numerous appearances in Disney parades, and has taken part in [[Disney on Ice]], and [[Disney on Parade]], usually in the latter two with painted-on eyes and teeth, along with a moving tongue. This Herbie model has been moved to [[Disney's All-Star Movies Resort]] in [[Walt Disney World]] and is the centrepiece of 'The Love Bug' themed area. \n* Herbie has an unofficial appearance along with Maggie Peyton (portrayed by \"Fully Loaded\" actor [[Breckin Meyer]]) in a segment of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' titled Horny Robot Redux. In the segment, he is a New Beetle rather than an original Beetle and has animated eyes and a mouth.\n* Herbie has a brief cameo in an episode of ''[[American Dad!]]'', where he helps [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] escape from poachers and wolves. In the episode, he has incorrect stripes and different 53 font.\n* The Herbie film series spawned a knockoff series of [[Superbug (film series)|Superbug]] films. A white Beetle, split in half and numbered 53, makes a cameo in the first film of the series, though its name is never mentioned.\n* Herbie had a cameo in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Beyond Blunderdome]]\" in the Movie Car Museum.\n* Herbie makes an appearance in \u2018\u2019[[Forza (series)|Forza]]\u2019\u2019 as a paint job for the 1960s Beetle\n* Herbie appears in a Disneyland's 50th Anniversary TV commercial where he is used for transportation by Mickey and Goofy to get to [[Disneyland]].\n\n== Guises and paint schemes ==\nHerbie's appearance remained consistent throughout the first four film entries as well as the 1982 television series. There were only minor, subtle changes. The 1997 TV movie and ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' featured major overhauls in Herbie's appearance, as there were different production crews working for Disney by this time.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:lovebug1.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he first appeared in ''The Love Bug''.]] -->\n\nIn order to create the effect of Herbie driving himself, Disney concocted a detailed system of sprockets and pulleys connected to a second steering column under the front seat for a rear seat driver. There was also a second set of pedal assemblies, clutch cables and a shifter extension. In ''The Love Bug'', the rear seat driver sat low enough to see over the windshield but still out of the view of the camera. For ''Herbie Rides Again'' and ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'', Disney installed a hood-mounted Carello fog light that concealed a small camera which allowed the rear seat driver to view the street and sit lower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovebugfans.net/faq.htm|title=LoveBugFans.com - The Ultimate Herbie Community|website=lovebugfans.net}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Love Bug'' (1968) ===\n[[File:Herbie film car from The Love Bug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Original film car used in ''The Love Bug'']]\nIn the original film, ''[[The Love Bug]]'', the original racing stripes differ from those in later movies; the stripes do not cover the valances or louvers of the car and the blue is a lighter shade. Also, Herbie features color-keyed running boards, while in later films the running boards are standard black.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\nDuring the film, depending on the scene, the wheels change from standard VW wheels (although fitted with plain hubcaps with no VW logo) to specially widened wheels on the racing Herbies. During one scene (when Tennessee is hanging out of the window), the \"53\" logo (a.k.a. \"gumball\") on the passenger-side door is missing. The door is also cut along the lower edge at an angle to enable the car to tilt over to the right on two wheels.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\nOne of the modified racing Herbies featured a [[Porsche 356]] engine, brakes and KONI shock absorbers. All Herbies in ''The Love Bug'' had the VW badges removed from the hood and featured plain non-VW hubcaps. The hood-mounted VW logo was replaced with a plain disc of the same diameter, colored to match the body. All VWs logos were removed to avoid any trademark conflicts.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\n=== ''Herbie Rides Again'' (1974) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:hrbridesagn.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in ''Herbie Rides Again'']] -->\nIn ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', Herbie features revised racing stripes, with the original blue switched to a dark navy. In addition, the stripes were applied over the valances and louvers, and the front hood was recycled for 1982's television series ''Herbie the Matchmaker''. Herbie also received a hood-mounted Carello fog light, and his running boards were now the more conventional black.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\nAdditionally, Herbie was running on standard wheels yet again. Volkswagen also promoted the film by having a Type 1 Beetle, complete with Herbie livery, in every showroom. There are various model errors in this film, such as the later \"big window\" (post-1964) Beetles being used. Also of note is the \"cut-n-shut\" engine cover after the warehouse break-in. The Beetle used was a late model, having a more bulbous flat-bottomed lid with an earlier rounded bottom edge welded on.\n\nAfter the success of ''[[The Love Bug]]'', the film was heavily endorsed by [[Volkswagen AG|Volkswagen]], which was in financial trouble at the time, when Beetle sales in North America were considerably lower than in previous decades. As such, the company insisted that the VW logos appear on Herbie. Both the hub cap VW logo and hood-mounted VW logo were reinstated at the company's request.\n\n=== ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'' (1977) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:herbmontecarlo.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'', seen here with his \"girlfriend\", Giselle the Lancia.]] -->\nIn ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'', Herbie is again fitted with wide racing wheels ([[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] GT radials), and has an external fuel filler cap. Post-1967 Beetles did feature the fuel tank accessible on the right side behind the fender; the silver cap itself, however, was fake and added for the film's storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vw-resource.com/years.html#1961-1970|title=The VW Beetle -- Changes Through the Years|website=www.vw-resource.com}}</ref> With the addition of the fuel filler, the antenna is now a retractable unit fitted on the front cowling, near the windshield wipers. He has a roll cage again, and he has Monte Carlo racing stickers on his windows (one on the front window, two on the left back window, and one on the rear window). Herbie still sports the hood-mounted Carello fog light with an added black cover sporting the company name. He now has gray bucket seats instead of stitched seats. Throughout this film, Herbie has an asymmetrical door mirror. There were a total of 9 VWs used in ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo''. Many of these cars were recycled for use in ''Herbie Goes Bananas''.<ref name=\"moviecars\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/lovebugfans/moviecars/index.htm|title=Lovebugfans.com - The Disney Cars|date=October 28, 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028040125/http://www.geocities.com/lovebugfans/moviecars/index.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2009}}</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:hgbnans.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in ''Herbie Goes Bananas'']] -->\n\n=== ''Herbie Goes Bananas'' (1980) ===\n\nIn ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'', the hood-mounted light, the grey roll cage bar, the Monte Carlo racing stickers and the silver gas cap were removed. He still had his gray bucket seats, asymmetrical door mirror and his Goodyear GT Radial racing tires and rims, and Herbie's sunroof was the original light gray rather than the dark gray from Monte Carlo. The rust seen on the car in this film was painted on some of the Herbies. The car that \"walks the plank\" in the movie was never recovered from the sea. It was tossed overboard from the \"M.N. Coromuel\" [[ferry]] ship (not ''The Sun Princess'' cruise ship). The car is somewhere between [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] and [[Baja California]]. The car thrown overboard was not a proper car and had many wooden parts.\n\n''Herbie Goes Bananas'' also featured the same later model door mirror as ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo''. Herbie set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] as the first car to go through the [[Panama Canal]] during filming in 1979. Herbie's name is only mentioned 3 times in the film by the garage owner, apart from the two times Herbie honks his horn at Paco trying to say his name when Paco couldn't understand what Herbie was saying.\n\nSome of these Herbie cars were recycled for ''[[Herbie, the Love Bug (TV series)|Herbie, the Love Bug]]'' in 1982.\n\nOne of the actual film cars used with its flip wheel chassis in the bullfighting scenes now resides in [[Sydney]], Australia. Another one was displayed in the [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] until the museum's closure in 2011. Since then its new location remains unknown.\n\nVolkswagen ceased the sale of Beetles in the USA one year before the film's release.\n\n=== ''The Love Bug'' (1997) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:herbie97.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in the 1997 TV movie ''The Love Bug'']] -->\nIn the [[television film]] ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]'' there were some significant changes. The graphics used were copied from the 1974 Volkswagen of America decal kit, and the position on the front [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] 53 was higher up. The racing stripes were different sizes, and the shade of blue reverted to the lighter version used in the original 1968 movie. The [[sunroof]] was a solid white (vs. gray) and was missing the racing stripes. Herbie's wheels were standard Beetle wheels, instead of the wider GoodYear GT Radial racing tires used in ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' and ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'', and the seats were regular instead of the gray bucket seats he had previously had.\n\n===''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' (2005)===\n[[File:Herbie-1138.jpg|thumb|right|2005 ''Fully Loaded'' version of Herbie, specifically his \"Street Race\" look]]\nIn ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', Herbie, who in this film seemed to be able to show [[emotions]] miming a [[face]], went through several \"costume changes\" throughout the movie, changing his style dramatically from scene to scene.\n* The font of the 53 is different, and it is slightly bigger and lower down on the front [[hood (vehicle)|hood]]. The racing stripe is missing from the sunroof and the stripes are painted the way they were in the first four Herbie movies. Herbie's front licence plate is not present on his front bumper anymore.\n* For the \"street racer\" look, Herbie has brighter white paint, a whale-tail [[Spoiler (automotive)|rear spoiler]], air intakes in the front of the rear fenders, lowered suspension, wider tires and a windowed rear engine cover through which blue [[light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting shows , No Vehicle Rear Bumper. He is also shown to have a [[nitrous oxide]] system to boost his speed during the race against Trip Murphy.\n* During the demolition derby, Herbie is stripped down with no vehicle interior panels,  vehicle racing seats or special street racing body parts. The sunroof cover has been removed, although the cutout remains to play important roles during the demolition derby. He still retains the same 53 logos on the sides that he wore in his street race look except with Targets or Bullseyes Sprayed over the Logos and the white paint and all vehicular modifications in his Street Racer Version were all dismantled and completely thrown away for good. He later gets red Bull's-eye targets spray-painted on his front doors and hood by Crash.\n* For the \"[[NASCAR]]\" look, Herbie gets a new, more off-white paint job, NASCAR sponsor decals, a different duck-tail rear spoiler, a roll cage, Goodyear Eagle NASCAR tires, wider fenders, and no more front turn signals or a back bumper or even a passenger seat and back seat.\n\nMore than 30 different Herbies were used during the shooting of this film.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/> One is on display at the [[Volo Auto Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volocars.com/rental_detailed.php?cid=954 |title=Volo Auto Museum Cars for Sale - Herbie Fully Loaded |publisher=Volocars.com |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124031128/http://www.volocars.com/rental_detailed.php?cid=954 |archivedate=January 24, 2013 }}</ref> and another one used during the NASCAR racing segment of the film is preserved at the [[Peterson Automotive Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petersen.org/exhibitions/the-vault |title=Petersen Automotive Museum: The Vault |publisher=Petersen.org |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317041825/http://www.petersen.org/exhibitions/the-vault |archivedate=March 17, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:VWBeetlesStamfordHall.jpg|thumb|right|Fan-made Herbie replicas at Stamford Hall]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Herbie}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal|Cars|Disney}}\n{{Herbie movies}}\n{{Volkswagen}}\n\n[[Category:Disney characters originating in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional racing cars]]\n[[Category:Herbie films| ]]\n[[Category:Comedy film franchises]]\n[[Category:Volkswagen vehicles]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1968]]\n[[Category:Volkswagen Beetle]]\n[[Category:Cars designed and produced for films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Cars powered by boxer engines]]\n\n[[it:Un maggiolino tutto matto]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Hatnote|\"Herbie, the Love Bug\" redirects here.

He has [[Sentience|a mind of his own]] and is capable of driving himself, and is often a serious contender in [[auto racing]] competitions. Throughout most of the franchise, Herbie is distinguished by red, white and blue [[racing stripe]]s from front to back bumper, a racing-style number '''53''' on the front luggage compartment lid, doors, and engine lid, and a yellow-on-black '63 [[Vehicle registration plates of California|California license plate]] with the registration \"'''OFP 857'''\".\n\n== History ==\n{{In-universe|section|date=January 2019}}\nHerbie's origins as a racing car are firmly established in ''[[The Love Bug]]'' [[1968 in film|(1968)]]. Before the events of the film, he was bought from the showroom of Peter Thorndyke ([[David Tomlinson]]) by [[San Francisco]] [[socialite]] Mrs. Van Luit for her upstairs maid, but returned him shortly afterwards due to reliability problems. He was then purchased by [[race driver]] Jim Douglas ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), who had earlier stood up for Herbie when Thorndyke kicked him. Tennessee Steinmetz ([[Buddy Hackett]]), Jim's best friend and housemate, names the car \"Herbie\" after his uncle Herb, a [[middleweight]] [[boxer]] whose nose got shaped more and more like a Volkswagen Beetle, then makes Herbie a racing car.\n\nIn ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' [[1974 in film|(1974)]], Herbie has been left to Tennessee's widowed aunt, Mrs. Steinmetz ([[Helen Hayes]]). Mrs. Steinmetz and her displaced neighbor, Nicole Harris ([[Stefanie Powers]]), try to save her house from being bulldozed by [[Alonzo Hawk]] ([[Keenan Wynn]]) with the help of Herbie. During the film, it is explained that after several successful races with Herbie, Douglas entered foreign racing circuits while his sidekick Tennessee is residing in [[Tibet]] to help his ailing instructor. During the film, it is revealed that Herbie has befriended other sentient VW Beetles and these team up with him to defeat Hawk, and we learn of the existence of other sentient objects (briefly mentioned by Tennessee in the first film), such as Mrs. Steinmetz's self-playing [[jukebox]].\n\nBy ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' [[1977 in film|(1977)]], Douglas enters Herbie in the [[Monte Carlo Rally|Trans-France Race]] and recruits mechanic friend Wheely Applegate ([[Don Knotts]]) to assist him. Herbie falls in love with a [[Lancia Montecarlo|Lancia Scorpion]] named Giselle (who is also sentient, although Jim, Herbie and Wheely are the first to discover it) and Douglas with her driver Diane Darcy ([[Julie Sommars]]). Herbie also finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when the stolen ''Etoile de Joie'' diamond is hidden in his gas tank.\n\nIn ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'' [[1980 in film|(1980)]], Douglas has retired from racing after Monte Carlo and leaves Herbie to his nephew, Pete Stancheck ([[Stephen W. Burns]]), who plans to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Primeo. In the interim, Herbie befriends an [[orphan]] named Paco ([[Joaquin Garay, III]]), with whom he wreaks havoc with onboard the cruise ship the ''Sun Princess'', prompting the overzealous Captain Blythe ([[Harvey Korman]]) to force Herbie to \"walk the plank\". Having fallen into the ocean, Herbie is rescued by Paco and disguised as a taxi, later to stop a gang of [[con artist]]s from stealing ancient [[Inca]] gold. Early in their partnership, Paco gives Herbie the nickname \"Ocho\" because he can't understand Herbie talking through his horn. Ocho is the Spanish word for the number 8; purportedly because the digits 5 and 3 in Herbie's racing number, 53, were combined to produce \"8\" (5+3 = 8) and possibly to rhyme with \"Vocho\", the Beetle's colloquial name in Mexico.\n\nAfter the Mexico debacle, Douglas takes in Herbie and opens a driving school in the TV series ''[[Herbie, the Love Bug (TV series)|Herbie, the Love Bug]]''. There, Douglas meets a woman named Susan MacLane and her three kids: Julie, Matthew, and Robbie, with the kids become friends to Herbie, But; however, a business man named Randy Bigelow want to get rid of Herbie and Douglas and get Susan back after they broke up during his wedding.\n\nHank Cooper ([[Bruce Campbell]]) becomes the owner of Herbie in the 1997 [[television film|made-for-television movie]] ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]''. Here, Herbie's origins as a sentient Volkswagen Beetle are explained: an elderly German engineer named Dr. Gustav Stumpfel was building Herbie when a picture of his deceased wife fell into a vat of molten metal; with Stumpfel's love for her animating Herbie. During the film, Stumpfel is forced to build an evil Volkswagen counterpart to Herbie, \"Horace the Hate Bug\", from a sample of Herbie's original metal. Horace's personality is influenced by the narcissism of Herbie's former owner Simon when he has a picture of himself dropped into the metal vats, and kills Herbie during the film. Cooper buries Herbie, but the return of Jim Douglas sets Cooper to rebuild the fallen Love Bug (with the help of the repentant Dr. Stumpfel) and have him race against Simon and Horace. In this race, Herbie ultimately divides himself in half (as in the original film) to win the race.\n\nOver the years Herbie is passed down from owner to owner (including someone named \"Maxx\", who left his driver suit inside the hood), competing in many races, until he starts losing constantly to newer and faster cars, and later found by a [[tow truck]] driver in a garage and carried to Crazy Dave's scrapyard and, later, bought by Maggie Peyton ([[Lindsay Lohan]]) in ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'' [[2005 in film|(2005)]]. He is later modified, becoming a 2002-cc-engined car and participating in various races, from a [[demolition derby]] to the final race of the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Nextel Cup Series]]. Herbie eventually falls in love with a [[Volkswagen New Beetle]] (which, at the end, is revealed to be a sentient car too).\n\n== Appearance in media ==\n\nHerbie has been the central character of five theatrical-release films, a made-for-TV movie, and a short-lived television series.\n\n=== Film series ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film\n|-\n!

[[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] reprised his role as Jim Douglas for the series.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|page=523}}</ref>  Five episodes were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083428/episodes|title=Herbie, the Love Bug (TV Series 1982): Episodes|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n* In 1990, Herbie made an appearance in the second season of the 1980s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.\n* An animated version of Herbie made a brief cameo in two episodes of ''[[House of Mouse]]''.\n* Two racing video games starring Herbie were released by [[Disney Interactive Studios]]: ''[[Disney's Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'' (2005) and ''[[Herbie Rescue Rally|Disney's Herbie: Rescue Rally]]'' (2007).\n* Herbie used to make an appearance in the ''[[Moteurs... Action! Stunt Show Spectacular|Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show]]'' at Disney theme parks, but was later replaced by [[Lightning McQueen]].\n* Herbie has had numerous appearances in Disney parades, and has taken part in [[Disney on Ice]], and [[Disney on Parade]], usually in the latter two with painted-on eyes and teeth, along with a moving tongue. This Herbie model has been moved to [[Disney's All-Star Movies Resort]] in [[Walt Disney World]] and is the centrepiece of 'The Love Bug' themed area. \n* Herbie has an unofficial appearance along with Maggie Peyton (portrayed by \"Fully Loaded\" actor [[Breckin Meyer]]) in a segment of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' titled Horny Robot Redux. In the segment, he is a New Beetle rather than an original Beetle and has animated eyes and a mouth.\n* Herbie has a brief cameo in an episode of ''[[American Dad!]]'', where he helps [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] escape from poachers and wolves. In the episode, he has incorrect stripes and different 53 font.\n* The Herbie film series spawned a knockoff series of [[Superbug (film series)|Superbug]] films. A white Beetle, split in half and numbered 53, makes a cameo in the first film of the series, though its name is never mentioned.\n* Herbie had a cameo in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Beyond Blunderdome]]\" in the Movie Car Museum.\n* Herbie makes an appearance in \u2018\u2019[[Forza (series)|Forza]]\u2019\u2019 as a paint job for the 1960s Beetle\n* Herbie appears in a Disneyland's 50th Anniversary TV commercial where he is used for transportation by Mickey and Goofy to get to [[Disneyland]].\n\n== Guises and paint schemes ==\nHerbie's appearance remained consistent throughout the first four film entries as well as the 1982 television series. There were only minor, subtle changes. The 1997 TV movie and ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' featured major overhauls in Herbie's appearance, as there were different production crews working for Disney by this time.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:lovebug1.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he first appeared in ''The Love Bug''.]] -->\n\nIn order to create the effect of Herbie driving himself, Disney concocted a detailed system of sprockets and pulleys connected to a second steering column under the front seat for a rear seat driver. There was also a second set of pedal assemblies, clutch cables and a shifter extension. In ''The Love Bug'', the rear seat driver sat low enough to see over the windshield but still out of the view of the camera. For ''Herbie Rides Again'' and ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'', Disney installed a hood-mounted Carello fog light that concealed a small camera which allowed the rear seat driver to view the street and sit lower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovebugfans.net/faq.htm|title=LoveBugFans.com - The Ultimate Herbie Community|website=lovebugfans.net}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Love Bug'' (1968) ===\n[[File:Herbie film car from The Love Bug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Original film car used in ''The Love Bug'']]\nIn the original film, ''[[The Love Bug]]'', the original racing stripes differ from those in later movies; the stripes do not cover the valances or louvers of the car and the blue is a lighter shade. Also, Herbie features color-keyed running boards, while in later films the running boards are standard black.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\nDuring the film, depending on the scene, the wheels change from standard VW wheels (although fitted with plain hubcaps with no VW logo) to specially widened wheels on the racing Herbies. During one scene (when Tennessee is hanging out of the window), the \"53\" logo (a.k.a. \"gumball\") on the passenger-side door is missing. The door is also cut along the lower edge at an angle to enable the car to tilt over to the right on two wheels.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\nOne of the modified racing Herbies featured a [[Porsche 356]] engine, brakes and KONI shock absorbers. All Herbies in ''The Love Bug'' had the VW badges removed from the hood and featured plain non-VW hubcaps. The hood-mounted VW logo was replaced with a plain disc of the same diameter, colored to match the body. All VWs logos were removed to avoid any trademark conflicts.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\n=== ''Herbie Rides Again'' (1974) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:hrbridesagn.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in ''Herbie Rides Again'']] -->\nIn ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', Herbie features revised racing stripes, with the original blue switched to a dark navy. In addition, the stripes were applied over the valances and louvers, and the front hood was recycled for 1982's television series ''Herbie the Matchmaker''. Herbie also received a hood-mounted Carello fog light, and his running boards were now the more conventional black.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/>\n\nAdditionally, Herbie was running on standard wheels yet again. Volkswagen also promoted the film by having a Type 1 Beetle, complete with Herbie livery, in every showroom. There are various model errors in this film, such as the later \"big window\" (post-1964) Beetles being used. Also of note is the \"cut-n-shut\" engine cover after the warehouse break-in. The Beetle used was a late model, having a more bulbous flat-bottomed lid with an earlier rounded bottom edge welded on.\n\nAfter the success of ''[[The Love Bug]]'', the film was heavily endorsed by [[Volkswagen AG|Volkswagen]], which was in financial trouble at the time, when Beetle sales in North America were considerably lower than in previous decades. As such, the company insisted that the VW logos appear on Herbie. Both the hub cap VW logo and hood-mounted VW logo were reinstated at the company's request.\n\n=== ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'' (1977) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:herbmontecarlo.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'', seen here with his \"girlfriend\", Giselle the Lancia.]] -->\nIn ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'', Herbie is again fitted with wide racing wheels ([[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] GT radials), and has an external fuel filler cap. Post-1967 Beetles did feature the fuel tank accessible on the right side behind the fender; the silver cap itself, however, was fake and added for the film's storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vw-resource.com/years.html#1961-1970|title=The VW Beetle -- Changes Through the Years|website=www.vw-resource.com}}</ref> With the addition of the fuel filler, the antenna is now a retractable unit fitted on the front cowling, near the windshield wipers. He has a roll cage again, and he has Monte Carlo racing stickers on his windows (one on the front window, two on the left back window, and one on the rear window). Herbie still sports the hood-mounted Carello fog light with an added black cover sporting the company name. He now has gray bucket seats instead of stitched seats. Throughout this film, Herbie has an asymmetrical door mirror. There were a total of 9 VWs used in ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo''. Many of these cars were recycled for use in ''Herbie Goes Bananas''.<ref name=\"moviecars\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/lovebugfans/moviecars/index.htm|title=Lovebugfans.com - The Disney Cars|date=October 28, 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028040125/http://www.geocities.com/lovebugfans/moviecars/index.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2009}}</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:hgbnans.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in ''Herbie Goes Bananas'']] -->\n\n=== ''Herbie Goes Bananas'' (1980) ===\n\nIn ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'', the hood-mounted light, the grey roll cage bar, the Monte Carlo racing stickers and the silver gas cap were removed. He still had his gray bucket seats, asymmetrical door mirror and his Goodyear GT Radial racing tires and rims, and Herbie's sunroof was the original light gray rather than the dark gray from Monte Carlo. The rust seen on the car in this film was painted on some of the Herbies. The car that \"walks the plank\" in the movie was never recovered from the sea. It was tossed overboard from the \"M.N. Coromuel\" [[ferry]] ship (not ''The Sun Princess'' cruise ship). The car is somewhere between [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] and [[Baja California]]. The car thrown overboard was not a proper car and had many wooden parts.\n\n''Herbie Goes Bananas'' also featured the same later model door mirror as ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo''. Herbie set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] as the first car to go through the [[Panama Canal]] during filming in 1979. Herbie's name is only mentioned 3 times in the film by the garage owner, apart from the two times Herbie honks his horn at Paco trying to say his name when Paco couldn't understand what Herbie was saying.\n\nSome of these Herbie cars were recycled for ''[[Herbie, the Love Bug (TV series)|Herbie, the Love Bug]]'' in 1982.\n\nOne of the actual film cars used with its flip wheel chassis in the bullfighting scenes now resides in [[Sydney]], Australia. Another one was displayed in the [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] until the museum's closure in 2011. Since then its new location remains unknown.\n\nVolkswagen ceased the sale of Beetles in the USA one year before the film's release.\n\n=== ''The Love Bug'' (1997) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:herbie97.gif|thumb|200px|Herbie as he appeared in the 1997 TV movie ''The Love Bug'']] -->\nIn the [[television film]] ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]'' there were some significant changes. The graphics used were copied from the 1974 Volkswagen of America decal kit, and the position on the front [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] 53 was higher up. The racing stripes were different sizes, and the shade of blue reverted to the lighter version used in the original 1968 movie. The [[sunroof]] was a solid white (vs. gray) and was missing the racing stripes. Herbie's wheels were standard Beetle wheels, instead of the wider GoodYear GT Radial racing tires used in ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' and ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'', and the seats were regular instead of the gray bucket seats he had previously had.\n\n===''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' (2005)===\n[[File:Herbie-1138.jpg|thumb|right|2005 ''Fully Loaded'' version of Herbie, specifically his \"Street Race\" look]]\nIn ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', Herbie, who in this film seemed to be able to show [[emotions]] miming a [[face]], went through several \"costume changes\" throughout the movie, changing his style dramatically from scene to scene.\n* The font of the 53 is different, and it is slightly bigger and lower down on the front [[hood (vehicle)|hood]]. The racing stripe is missing from the sunroof and the stripes are painted the way they were in the first four Herbie movies. Herbie's front licence plate is not present on his front bumper anymore.\n* For the \"street racer\" look, Herbie has brighter white paint, a whale-tail [[Spoiler (automotive)|rear spoiler]], air intakes in the front of the rear fenders, lowered suspension, wider tires and a windowed rear engine cover through which blue [[light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting shows , No Vehicle Rear Bumper. He is also shown to have a [[nitrous oxide]] system to boost his speed during the race against Trip Murphy.\n* During the demolition derby, Herbie is stripped down with no vehicle interior panels,  vehicle racing seats or special street racing body parts. The sunroof cover has been removed, although the cutout remains to play important roles during the demolition derby. He still retains the same 53 logos on the sides that he wore in his street race look except with Targets or Bullseyes Sprayed over the Logos and the white paint and all vehicular modifications in his Street Racer Version were all dismantled and completely thrown away for good. He later gets red Bull's-eye targets spray-painted on his front doors and hood by Crash.\n* For the \"[[NASCAR]]\" look, Herbie gets a new, more off-white paint job, NASCAR sponsor decals, a different duck-tail rear spoiler, a roll cage, Goodyear Eagle NASCAR tires, wider fenders, and no more front turn signals or a back bumper or even a passenger seat and back seat.\n\nMore than 30 different Herbies were used during the shooting of this film.<ref name=\"moviecars\"/> One is on display at the [[Volo Auto Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volocars.com/rental_detailed.php?cid=954 |title=Volo Auto Museum Cars for Sale - Herbie Fully Loaded |publisher=Volocars.com |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124031128/http://www.volocars.com/rental_detailed.php?cid=954 |archivedate=January 24, 2013 }}</ref> and another one used during the NASCAR racing segment of the film is preserved at the [[Peterson Automotive Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petersen.org/exhibitions/the-vault |title=Petersen Automotive Museum: The Vault |publisher=Petersen.org |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317041825/http://www.petersen.org/exhibitions/the-vault |archivedate=March 17, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:VWBeetlesStamfordHall.jpg|thumb|right|Fan-made Herbie replicas at Stamford Hall]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Herbie}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal|Cars|Disney}}\n{{Herbie movies}}\n{{Volkswagen}}\n\n[[Category:Disney characters originating in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional racing cars]]\n[[Category:Herbie films| ]]\n[[Category:Comedy film franchises]]\n[[Category:Volkswagen vehicles]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1968]]\n[[Category:Volkswagen Beetle]]\n[[Category:Cars designed and produced for films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Cars powered by boxer engines]]\n\n[[it:Un maggiolino tutto matto]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFilm series", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie"}
