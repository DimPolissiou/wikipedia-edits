While the play had originally been around two hours in length, the episode was only half an hour. \"Tom & Gerri\" follows a difficult period in the life of Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher and aspiring writer, and his girlfriend Gerri ([[Gemma Arterton]]), a struggling actress, after Tom invites the homeless Migg (Pemberton) into his home.

Tom complains about a [[tramp]] begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), knocks at his door to return Tom's wallet. He introduces himself, and Tom rewards him with \u00a340 from his wallet. Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew [[Charles Bukowski]], whose literary work Tom idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink.\n\nTom awakes the next morning on his sofa. Gerri is alarmed to see him there, as he should be at work, and then gets angry that Migg was invited in. Migg emerges from the bathroom as Gerri leaves the house, and encourages Tom to phone in sick. It is revealed that Tom had promised Migg some of his clothes, and Migg makes breakfast. Later, Migg and Tom play ''[[Risk (boardgame)|Risk]]'' and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called. When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine, Migg hides Tom's mobile phone and deletes an answerphone message left by Tom's colleague Stevie (Hill).\n\nA week later, Tom lies in bed, smoking and writing. Gerri enters the room, and it is revealed that Tom has quit his job as a teacher. She has been rehearsing in [[Portsmouth]] and says she left him dozens of messages, but Tom thinks he's lost his phone. The pair fight over Migg, who is still living with Tom. Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. He sits down to play ''[[Scrabble]]'' with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has \"no right\" to judge him. Tom storms out of the room, and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom, saying \"Thank you, Grandma!\" and taking the \u00a310 that Tom's grandmother sent him. The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit. He has brought Tom vouchers for [[The Body Shop]]. Stevie invites Tom out for dinner, but he declines. Stevie leaves, and Tom settles down with Migg on the sofa.\n\nTom's electricity supply is cut off due to the bills not being paid, and he weeps. A shaven Migg, wearing clean clothes, enters the house. He has started a job, working with children, and gives Tom \u00a340 because Tom has \"done so much\" for Migg. Migg wants to take over the tenancy on the flat until Tom's benefits come in. He walks into the bathroom to get into the bath as Gerri walks in and comforts Tom, who asks her not to leave. Gerri tells Tom that he has invented Migg to cope with what has been happening. She says Tom is [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and has had a [[nervous breakdown]]. The pair head into the bathroom, but there is no Migg. Gerri tells Tom to \"get this Migg out of [his] head once and for all\". She leaves, and Migg emerges from a hiding place; he asks if everything is alright.\n\nThings apparently get better: the flat is tidy, Tom is smartly dressed and clean-shaven. Gerri is happily chatting to him. Tom answers the door to Stevie, who asks Tom to come back to work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = You're not Charles Bukowski, you're just a primary school teacher who had a nervous breakdown.\n |source = Gerri, upon finding Tom in the dark flat.

Instead, he suggested, the reference was more likely to cartoon characters [[Tom Cat|Tom]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]], saying that there \"is definitely a hint of cat and mouse\" in the plot.<ref name=\"Dessau\">{{cite news|title= Review: Inside No. 9: Tom & Gerri, BBC2|url= http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/review-inside-no-9-tom-gerri-bbc2|author= [[Bruce Dessau|Dessau, Bruce]]|publisher= Beyondthejoke.co.uk|date= February 2014|accessdate= 20 February 2014}}</ref> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' critics Larushka Ivan-Zadeh and Carol Carter concurred, saying that the plot consisted of \"a game of cat and mouse\".<ref name=\"Metro\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{ external media\n| video1 = \"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01s4wf4 D-Day Doris]\"<br/> Tom and Gerri talk about Gerri's acting\n| video2 = \"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01s4wvq Migg's reward]\"<br/> Migg returns Tom's wallet\n}}\nThe episode begins with Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting to his girlfriend Gerri (Arterton), who is going to audition for a part in a play. Tom complains about a [[tramp]] begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), knocks at his door to return Tom's wallet. He introduces himself, and Tom rewards him with \u00a340 from his wallet. Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew [[Charles Bukowski]], whose literary work Tom idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink.\n\nTom awakes the next morning on his sofa. Gerri is alarmed to see him there, as he should be at work, and then gets angry that Migg was invited in. Migg emerges from the bathroom as Gerri leaves the house, and encourages Tom to phone in sick. It is revealed that Tom had promised Migg some of his clothes, and Migg makes breakfast. Later, Migg and Tom play ''[[Risk (boardgame)|Risk]]'' and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called. When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine, Migg hides Tom's mobile phone and deletes an answerphone message left by Tom's colleague Stevie (Hill).\n\nA week later, Tom lies in bed, smoking and writing. Gerri enters the room, and it is revealed that Tom has quit his job as a teacher. She has been rehearsing in [[Portsmouth]] and says she left him dozens of messages, but Tom thinks he's lost his phone. The pair fight over Migg, who is still living with Tom. Later still, the flat is a mess, and Tom is unkempt and drinking heavily. He has no messages on his phone and no post. He sits down to play ''[[Scrabble]]'' with Migg, and it is revealed that it is Tom's birthday. The two argue about washing up, and Migg says that Tom has \"no right\" to judge him. Tom storms out of the room, and Migg flicks through birthday cards he has hidden from Tom, saying \"Thank you, Grandma!\" and taking the \u00a310 that Tom's grandmother sent him. The house and Tom have deteriorated further when Stevie comes to visit. He has brought Tom vouchers for [[The Body Shop]]. Stevie invites Tom out for dinner, but he declines. Stevie leaves, and Tom settles down with Migg on the sofa.\n\nTom's electricity supply is cut off due to the bills not being paid, and he weeps. A shaven Migg, wearing clean clothes, enters the house. He has started a job, working with children, and gives Tom \u00a340 because Tom has \"done so much\" for Migg. Migg wants to take over the tenancy on the flat until Tom's benefits come in. He walks into the bathroom to get into the bath as Gerri walks in and comforts Tom, who asks her not to leave. Gerri tells Tom that he has invented Migg to cope with what has been happening. She says Tom is [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and has had a [[nervous breakdown]]. The pair head into the bathroom, but there is no Migg. Gerri tells Tom to \"get this Migg out of [his] head once and for all\". She leaves, and Migg emerges from a hiding place; he asks if everything is alright.\n\nThings apparently get better: the flat is tidy, Tom is smartly dressed and clean-shaven. Gerri is happily chatting to him. Tom answers the door to Stevie, who asks Tom to come back to work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = You're not Charles Bukowski, you're just a primary school teacher who had a nervous breakdown.\n |source = Gerri, upon finding Tom in the dark flat.

These low-cost CubeSat missions provide NASA with valuable opportunities to test emerging technologies that may be useful in future space missions, while university students get to be involved in all phases of the mission, from instrument and satellite design, to launch and monitoring.\n[[File:CeREs VCLS CubeSat 0002 (26563127467).jpg|thumb|Engineers processing a CubeSat on [[Rocket Lab]]'s facility]]\nA CubeSat has a cubic shape measuring 10\u00d710\u00d710&nbsp;cm (1 unit or 1U), and can be fabricated of multiple cubic units such as 2U, 3U and 6U, and weighing 1.33&nbsp;kg per Unit. Because of the high cost incurred by launching them to orbit, ELaNa's satellites are launched as secondary payload on other missions that have mass and space to spare. Since the launch waiting list has grown considerably, another initiative was launched in 2015 in partnership with the private industry to develop launch vehicles dedicated to CubeSats exclusively. A new company is called [[Rocket Lab]] and their launch vehicle is the [[Electron (rocket)|Electron rocket]].<ref name='Sat Today'>[http://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2015/07/31/rocket-lab-signs-nasa-partnership-to-tap-launch-resources/ Rocket Lab Signs NASA Partnership to Tap Launch Resources].

NASA. 2017.</ref> The program is managed by the [[Launch Services Program]] (LSP) at NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida.\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe ELaNa initiative has made partnerships with universities in the US to design and launch small research satellites called [[CubeSat]]s (because of their cube shape). These low-cost CubeSat missions provide NASA with valuable opportunities to test emerging technologies that may be useful in future space missions, while university students get to be involved in all phases of the mission, from instrument and satellite design, to launch and monitoring.\n[[File:CeREs VCLS CubeSat 0002 (26563127467).jpg|thumb|Engineers processing a CubeSat on [[Rocket Lab]]'s facility]]\nA CubeSat has a cubic shape measuring 10\u00d710\u00d710&nbsp;cm (1 unit or 1U), and can be fabricated of multiple cubic units such as 2U, 3U and 6U, and weighing 1.33&nbsp;kg per Unit. Because of the high cost incurred by launching them to orbit, ELaNa's satellites are launched as secondary payload on other missions that have mass and space to spare. Since the launch waiting list has grown considerably, another initiative was launched in 2015 in partnership with the private industry to develop launch vehicles dedicated to CubeSats exclusively. A new company is called [[Rocket Lab]] and their launch vehicle is the [[Electron (rocket)|Electron rocket]].<ref name='Sat Today'>[http://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2015/07/31/rocket-lab-signs-nasa-partnership-to-tap-launch-resources/ Rocket Lab Signs NASA Partnership to Tap Launch Resources].

It first aired on February 15, 2015, as part of the second episode of the series' second season. During the eighteen-minute segment, comedian [[John Oliver]] discusses tobacco industry trends and practices.\n\nToward the end of the segment, Oliver introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]], the makers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes. The [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to [[Joe Camel]] and the [[Marlboro Man]]. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to [[Togo]] and displaying billboards in [[Uruguay]], and by encouraging use of the [[hashtag]] #JeffWeCan, which trended on [[Twitter]] following the broadcast.\n\nAfter the segment, Philip Morris issued a response that received some criticism. The \"Tobacco\" segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The Jeff caricature was later used at a May 2015 protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in [[New York City]].\n\n==Description==\n{{external media\n|float=right\n|width=20em\n|video1=[http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/02/26-february-15-2015/index.html ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Season 2 Episode 26] on [[HBO]]\n|video2={{YouTube|id=6UsHHOCH4q8|title=''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Tobacco (HBO)}}\n}}\n\"Tobacco\", an eighteen-minute segment about the [[tobacco industry]], was delivered by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] on February 15, 2015, during the second episode of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]''{{'s}} second season.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Andy|title=John Oliver Lights Up The Tobacco Industry And Their International Legal Shenanigans|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/john-oliver-tobacco-last-week-tonight-video_n_6692270.html|accessdate=January 20, 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=February 16, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213191612/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/john-oliver-tobacco-last-week-tonight-video_n_6692270.html|archivedate=February 13, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tovey 2015\">{{cite news|last=Tovey|first=Josephine|title=John Oliver highlights Australia's cigarette plain packaging laws, introduces new tobacco mascot 'Jeff the Diseased Lung'|issn=0312-6315|oclc=226369741|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/john-oliver-highlights-australias-cigarette-plain-packaging-laws-introduces-new-tobacco-mascot-jeff-the-diseased-lung-20150217-13gjl3.html|accessdate=January 20, 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=February 17, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112154627/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/john-oliver-highlights-australias-cigarette-plain-packaging-laws-introduces-new-tobacco-mascot-jeff-the-diseased-lung-20150217-13gjl3.html|archivedate=January 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Oliver introduces the topic of [[tobacco smoking]] by showing video clips of \"trusted newsmen, cartoon characters, and cowboys in TV commercials\" who are smoking cigarettes.<ref name=\"youtube-lwt20150215\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8|title=Tobacco|date=February 15, 2015|publisher=[[HBO]]|via=[[YouTube]]|last=Oliver|first=John|author-link=John Oliver|accessdate=August 16, 2016|df=mdy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812125118/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8|archive-date=August 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He says that the cowboy in the clip is [[Marlboro Man]], a figure used in [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaigns for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes, and notes that four of the actors portraying Marlboro Man have died from [[lung cancer]] or [[Health effects of tobacco|smoking-related illnesses]].<ref name=Inquisitr>{{cite web|title=The Marlboro Man Has Been Replaced: Meet Jeff, the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1848782/the-marlboro-man-has-been-replaced-meet-jeff-the-diseased-lung-in-a-cowboy-hat-video/|website=[[The Inquisitr]]|accessdate=December 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223051659/http://www.inquisitr.com/1848782/the-marlboro-man-has-been-replaced-meet-jeff-the-diseased-lung-in-a-cowboy-hat-video/|archivedate=December 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Grisham>{{cite news|last=Grisham|first=Lori|title=John Oliver's Marlboro mascot idea?

The segment includes many mischaracterizations of our company, including our approach to marketing and regulation, which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license [...] While we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians, we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health [...] We support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide \u2013 including advertising restrictions, penalties for selling tobacco products to minors, and substantial health warnings on packaging. We're investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them. And, like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally applied to us.<ref name=Parker/></blockquote>\n\nThe statement also provided readers with a \"balanced view\", and facts about the issues raised by Oliver, including the company's marketing practices and \"approach to regulation\". Philip Morris included links to its \"Be Marlboro\" campaign, which is \"aimed at competing for existing adult smoker market share\", reasons why the company is challenging Australia and Uruguay's censorship of its trademarks, and \"facts about smoking prevalence in Australia after the introduction of plain packaging\".<ref name=Parker/>\n\nChris Morran of ''[[Consumerist]]'' said Philip Morris did a \"really poor job of trying to defend its actions\". He wrote, \"[...] this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic non-response in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth.\"<ref name=Morran/> He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: \"[expects] to be taken seriously when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'\".<ref name=Morran/> Furthermore, Chris Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it \"[supports] and [complies] with thousands of regulations worldwide\", writing: <blockquote>[...] the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle \u2013 or realizes a battle can't be won \u2013 then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.<ref name=Morran/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, he said of the statement's final sentence: \"That's honestly the best Philip Morris and Big Tobacco can come up with \u2013 We've spent a lot of money and have a lot of investors so please don't mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits [...] It's an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them \u2013 or live in the same house with them.\"<ref name=Morran/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cigarette packets in Australia]]\n* [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/02/26-february-15-2015/index.html ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Season 2 Episode 26] on [[HBO]]\n** [http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/02/26-february-15-2015/video/ep-26-clip-big-tobaccos-still-at-it.html?autoplay=true Ep. 26 Clip: Big Tobacco's Still At It] on HBO\n* {{YouTube|id=6UsHHOCH4q8|title=''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Tobacco (HBO)}}\n* {{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-john-oliver-rips-tobacco-companies-with-diseased-lung-mascot-jeff-video/|title=John Oliver Smokes the Tobacco Industry with Diseased-Lung Mascot 'Jeff'|first=Alicia|last=Banks|date=February 16, 2015|website=[[TheWrap]]|publisher=The Wrap News Inc.}}\n* {{Cite web|url=http://zap2it.com/2015/02/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-takes-down-tobacco-industry/|title='Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' takes down the tobacco industry|date=February 16, 2015|first=Sarah|last=Huggins|website=[[Zap2it]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]}}\n\n{{Last Week Tonight}}\n{{Portal bar|Comedy|Television|United States}}\n\n[[Category:2015 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Advertising and marketing controversies]]\n[[Category:American mascots]]\n[[Category:Cartoon mascots]]\n[[Category:Criticisms of companies]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional body parts]]\n[[Category:Fictional cowboys and cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Philip Morris]]\n[[Category:Smoking in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2015]]\n[[Category:Tobacco advertising characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Tobacco (''Last Week Tonight'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Tobacco\n| series       = [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]\n| image        = <!-- bare filename only.

It first aired on February 15, 2015, as part of the second episode of the series' second season. During the eighteen-minute segment, comedian [[John Oliver]] discusses tobacco industry trends and practices.\n\nToward the end of the segment, Oliver introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]], the makers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes. The [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to [[Joe Camel]] and the [[Marlboro Man]]. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to [[Togo]] and displaying billboards in [[Uruguay]], and by encouraging use of the [[hashtag]] #JeffWeCan, which trended on [[Twitter]] following the broadcast.\n\nAfter the segment, Philip Morris issued a response that received some criticism. The \"Tobacco\" segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The Jeff caricature was later used at a May 2015 protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in [[New York City]].\n\n==Description==\n{{external media\n|float=right\n|width=20em\n|video1=[http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/02/26-february-15-2015/index.html ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Season 2 Episode 26] on [[HBO]]\n|video2={{YouTube|id=6UsHHOCH4q8|title=''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Tobacco (HBO)}}\n}}\n\"Tobacco\", an eighteen-minute segment about the [[tobacco industry]], was delivered by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] on February 15, 2015, during the second episode of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]''{{'s}} second season.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Andy|title=John Oliver Lights Up The Tobacco Industry And Their International Legal Shenanigans|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/john-oliver-tobacco-last-week-tonight-video_n_6692270.html|accessdate=January 20, 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=February 16, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213191612/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/john-oliver-tobacco-last-week-tonight-video_n_6692270.html|archivedate=February 13, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tovey 2015\">{{cite news|last=Tovey|first=Josephine|title=John Oliver highlights Australia's cigarette plain packaging laws, introduces new tobacco mascot 'Jeff the Diseased Lung'|issn=0312-6315|oclc=226369741|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/john-oliver-highlights-australias-cigarette-plain-packaging-laws-introduces-new-tobacco-mascot-jeff-the-diseased-lung-20150217-13gjl3.html|accessdate=January 20, 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=February 17, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112154627/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/john-oliver-highlights-australias-cigarette-plain-packaging-laws-introduces-new-tobacco-mascot-jeff-the-diseased-lung-20150217-13gjl3.html|archivedate=January 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Oliver introduces the topic of [[tobacco smoking]] by showing video clips of \"trusted newsmen, cartoon characters, and cowboys in TV commercials\" who are smoking cigarettes.<ref name=\"youtube-lwt20150215\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8|title=Tobacco|date=February 15, 2015|publisher=[[HBO]]|via=[[YouTube]]|last=Oliver|first=John|author-link=John Oliver|accessdate=August 16, 2016|df=mdy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812125118/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8|archive-date=August 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He says that the cowboy in the clip is [[Marlboro Man]], a figure used in [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaigns for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes, and notes that four of the actors portraying Marlboro Man have died from [[lung cancer]] or [[Health effects of tobacco|smoking-related illnesses]].<ref name=Inquisitr>{{cite web|title=The Marlboro Man Has Been Replaced: Meet Jeff, the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1848782/the-marlboro-man-has-been-replaced-meet-jeff-the-diseased-lung-in-a-cowboy-hat-video/|website=[[The Inquisitr]]|accessdate=December 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223051659/http://www.inquisitr.com/1848782/the-marlboro-man-has-been-replaced-meet-jeff-the-diseased-lung-in-a-cowboy-hat-video/|archivedate=December 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Grisham>{{cite news|last=Grisham|first=Lori|title=John Oliver's Marlboro mascot idea?

The segment includes many mischaracterizations of our company, including our approach to marketing and regulation, which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license [...] While we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians, we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health [...] We support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide \u2013 including advertising restrictions, penalties for selling tobacco products to minors, and substantial health warnings on packaging. We're investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them. And, like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally applied to us.<ref name=Parker/></blockquote>\n\nThe statement also provided readers with a \"balanced view\", and facts about the issues raised by Oliver, including the company's marketing practices and \"approach to regulation\". Philip Morris included links to its \"Be Marlboro\" campaign, which is \"aimed at competing for existing adult smoker market share\", reasons why the company is challenging Australia and Uruguay's censorship of its trademarks, and \"facts about smoking prevalence in Australia after the introduction of plain packaging\".<ref name=Parker/>\n\nChris Morran of ''[[Consumerist]]'' said Philip Morris did a \"really poor job of trying to defend its actions\". He wrote, \"[...] this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic non-response in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth.\"<ref name=Morran/> He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: \"[expects] to be taken seriously when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'\".<ref name=Morran/> Furthermore, Chris Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it \"[supports] and [complies] with thousands of regulations worldwide\", writing: <blockquote>[...] the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle \u2013 or realizes a battle can't be won \u2013 then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.<ref name=Morran/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, he said of the statement's final sentence: \"That's honestly the best Philip Morris and Big Tobacco can come up with \u2013 We've spent a lot of money and have a lot of investors so please don't mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits [...] It's an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them \u2013 or live in the same house with them.\"<ref name=Morran/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cigarette packets in Australia]]\n* [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/02/26-february-15-2015/index.html ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Season 2 Episode 26] on [[HBO]]\n** [http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/episodes/02/26-february-15-2015/video/ep-26-clip-big-tobaccos-still-at-it.html?autoplay=true Ep. 26 Clip: Big Tobacco's Still At It] on HBO\n* {{YouTube|id=6UsHHOCH4q8|title=''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'': Tobacco (HBO)}}\n* {{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-john-oliver-rips-tobacco-companies-with-diseased-lung-mascot-jeff-video/|title=John Oliver Smokes the Tobacco Industry with Diseased-Lung Mascot 'Jeff'|first=Alicia|last=Banks|date=February 16, 2015|website=[[TheWrap]]|publisher=The Wrap News Inc.}}\n* {{Cite web|url=http://zap2it.com/2015/02/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-takes-down-tobacco-industry/|title='Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' takes down the tobacco industry|date=February 16, 2015|first=Sarah|last=Huggins|website=[[Zap2it]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]}}\n\n{{Last Week Tonight}}\n{{Portal bar|Comedy|Television|United States}}\n\n[[Category:2015 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Advertising and marketing controversies]]\n[[Category:American mascots]]\n[[Category:Cartoon mascots]]\n[[Category:Criticisms of companies]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional body parts]]\n[[Category:Fictional cowboys and cowgirls]]\n[[Category:Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Philip Morris]]\n[[Category:Smoking in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2015]]\n[[Category:Tobacco advertising characters]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_(Last_Week_Tonight)"}
