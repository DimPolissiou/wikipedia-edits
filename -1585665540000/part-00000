In April 2014 a one-hour documentary could expose how the company cooperated with oppressive regimes in a business region the company called \"Eurasia\" that included long time dictatorships like [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Azerbaijan|Azerbadjan]]. In September 2016 the first reportage on how the company also bribed their way to these markets was published which after several subsequent reports led to the resignation of the company's CEO [[Lars Nyberg]] (2013) and the board. In 2015 Telia Sonera declared that it was selling all its assets in \"Eurasia\" - and the loss to the biggest owner - the Swedish state - was estimated at 20 BN SEK [[Dagens Industry]]. The recipient of Telia Soneras payments for Uzbek licenses, [[Gulnara Karimova]] the daughter to the long time dictator [[Islam Karimov]], was deposed by her father because of the international scandal following the publication. In 2013 the trio was awarded another \"[[Guldspaden]]\" by Swedish Investigative Editors and Reporters and with a third \"Stora Journalistpriset\" Stora journalistpriset for their reporting on Telia Sonera.\n\n== Filmography ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2014}}\n\n*2012 \"The Snowden documents\" - on the relationship between the NSA and Swedish FRA.\n*2012: \"The Uzbek affair\" - Nordic Telecom Teliasonera's bribery scandal with the regime (Gulnara Karimova) in Uzbekistan. \n*2012: \"The Black Boxes\"<ref>[http://ftp.trojkan.se/temp/Reportage/SVT_De_svarta_l%e5dorna_Teliasonera_20120418/Teliasonera%20cooperates%20with%20oppressive%20regimes%20-%20Uppdrag%20Granskning%20_%20SVT.pdf Pressrelease]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> - on how the Swedish-Finnish state owned telco Teliasonera cooperates with countries like Uzbekistan and Belarus in providing them access to their mobile telephone systems.\n*2011: \"The letter from Mubarak\" - on the legacy of the Swedish-Egyptian security collaboration, and first-ever interviews with Ahmed Agiza and Muhammed Alzery.\n*2010: \"Euroorphans \u2013 the children left behind\" \u2013 investigative documentary about the hundreds of thousands of children in former East Europe growing up without their parents, who are in Western Europe as migrant workers to sustain the children in their home countries.\n*2010: \"In secret\" \u2013 Secret military intelligence reports about suspected Russian dumping of radioactive material and chemical agents in the Baltic Sea.

Abrams was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|head booker]] of the company from 1990 to 1992. [[Zoogz Rift]], a cult musician and manager in the UWF, took over as head booker in 1993. Zoogz Rift accompanied Abrams on several international business trips in 1993, where they managed to secure home video deals for the company. He quit in March 1994, leaving Abrams to book the September 1994 Blackjack Brawl card. In late 1995, Rift rejoined the company as [[vice president]], helping to secure new television deals with both [[SportsChannel America]] and [[Prime Network]]. Abrams' death in July 1996, however, marked the end of the company. Blackjack Brawl would stand as the final UWF show.\n\nThe UWF tape library was kept in a California storage unit maintained by wrestler Al Burke when Abrams left for New York to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994.  When Abrams died, Burke claimed the library as abandoned property. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]].

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 17 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of January 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award.

As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students. At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small [[dwarf rabbit]], and begins developing complex feelings for her.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Nihongo|'''Legoshi'''|\u30ec\u30b4\u30b7|Regoshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Chikahiro Kobayashi<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-07/chikahiro-kobayashi-sayaka-senbongi-star-in-beastars-anime/.148771|title=Chikahiro Kobayashi, Sayaka Senbongi Star in BEASTARS Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2019|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref>|Jonah Scott<ref name=\"Beastars ENG Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Mateo |first1=Alex |title=BEASTARS Anime Reveals English Dub Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-20/beastars-anime-reveals-english-dub-cast/.156674 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 20, 2020 |date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Legoshi, 17 years old at the start of the story,<ref name=Vol1ENVizp204>{{cite book|author=Itagaki, Paru|translator=Tomoko Kimura|title=Beastars|language=en|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|date=July 2019|volume=1|page=204}} - First printing, and Annette Roman did the adaptation.</ref> is a towering gray [[wolf]] with a quiet personality contrasting his appearance.

At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small [[dwarf rabbit]], and begins developing complex feelings for her.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Nihongo|'''Legoshi'''|\u30ec\u30b4\u30b7|Regoshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Chikahiro Kobayashi<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-07/chikahiro-kobayashi-sayaka-senbongi-star-in-beastars-anime/.148771|title=Chikahiro Kobayashi, Sayaka Senbongi Star in BEASTARS Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2019|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref>|Jonah Scott<ref name=\"Beastars ENG Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Mateo |first1=Alex |title=BEASTARS Anime Reveals English Dub Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-20/beastars-anime-reveals-english-dub-cast/.156674 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 20, 2020 |date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Legoshi, 17 years old at the start of the story,<ref name=Vol1ENVizp204>{{cite book|author=Itagaki, Paru|translator=Tomoko Kimura|title=Beastars|language=en|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|date=July 2019|volume=1|page=204}} - First printing, and Annette Roman did the adaptation.</ref> is a towering gray [[wolf]] with a quiet personality contrasting his appearance.

{"title_page": "Revolutionary socialism", "text_new": "{{short description|Political ideology}}\n{{primary sources|date=August 2018}}\n{{Socialism sidebar|Variants}}\n'''Revolutionary socialism''' is the [[Socialism|socialist]] doctrine that [[social revolution]] is necessary in order to bring about structural changes to society. More specifically, it is the view that revolution is a necessary precondition for a transition from [[capitalism]] to socialism. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the [[working class]] so that the [[State (polity)|state]] is directly controlled or abolished by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests.<ref name=sdvrds>[http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1903/1000-thompson-whatrevsoc.pdf What Revolutionary Socialism Means] by Carl D. Thompson.</ref> Revolutionary socialists believe such a state of affairs is a precondition for establishing socialism and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] believe that it is inevitable but not predetermined.\n\nRevolutionary socialism encompasses multiple political and social movements that may define \"revolution\" differently from one another. These include movements based on orthodox Marxist theory, such as [[De Leonism]], [[impossibilism]], and [[Luxemburgism]]; as well as movements based on [[Leninism]] and the theory of [[Vanguardism|vanguardist]]-led revolution, such as [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and [[Trotskyism]]. Revolutionary socialism also includes non-Marxist movements, such as those found in [[social anarchism]], revolutionary [[syndicalism]], [[social democracy]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\nIt is used in contrast to the [[reformism]] of [[social democracy]] and other evolutionary approaches to socialism. Revolutionary socialism is opposed to social movements that seek to gradually ameliorate the economic and social problems of capitalism through political reform.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], 1875]]\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote:<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007]</ref> {{quote|The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air. Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie. In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat. (...) The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; (...) The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.|Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto'', 1848}}\n\nTwenty-four years after ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx and Engels admitted that in developed countries \"labour may attain its goal by peaceful means\".<ref>\"... we do not deny that there are countries like England and America... where labour may attain its goal by peaceful means.\" Marx, 18 September 1872, at the Hague Congress of the International, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/08.htm, K. Marx and F. Engels, On Britain, Foreign Languages Press, Moscow, 1962</ref> Marxist scholar [[Adam Schaff]] argued that Marx, Engels and Lenin have expressed such view \"on many occasions\".<ref>\"Both Marx and Engels and, later, Lenin on many occasions referred to a ''peaceful'' revolution, that is, one attained by a class struggle, but not by violence.\" Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no.2 (Apr\u2013Jun 1973)</ref> By contrast, the Blanquist view emphasised the overthrow by force of the ruling elite in government by an active minority of revolutionaries, who then proceed to implement socialist change, disregarding the state of readiness of society as a whole and the mass of the population in particular for revolutionary change.\n\nIn 1875, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) published a somewhat reformist [[Gotha Program]], which was attacked by Marx in ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', where he reiterated the need for [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The reformist viewpoint was introduced into Marxist thought by [[Eduard Bernstein]], one of the leaders of the SPD. From 1896 to 1898, Bernstein published a series of articles entitled \"Probleme des Sozialismus\" (\"Problems of Socialism\").

More specifically, it is the view that revolution is a necessary precondition for a transition from [[capitalism]] to socialism. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the [[working class]] so that the [[State (polity)|state]] is directly controlled or abolished by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests.<ref name=sdvrds>[http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1903/1000-thompson-whatrevsoc.pdf What Revolutionary Socialism Means] by Carl D. Thompson.</ref> Revolutionary socialists believe such a state of affairs is a precondition for establishing socialism and [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] believe that it is inevitable but not predetermined.\n\nRevolutionary socialism encompasses multiple political and social movements that may define \"revolution\" differently from one another. These include movements based on orthodox Marxist theory, such as [[De Leonism]], [[impossibilism]], and [[Luxemburgism]]; as well as movements based on [[Leninism]] and the theory of [[Vanguardism|vanguardist]]-led revolution, such as [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], and [[Trotskyism]]. Revolutionary socialism also includes non-Marxist movements, such as those found in [[social anarchism]], revolutionary [[syndicalism]], [[social democracy]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\nIt is used in contrast to the [[reformism]] of [[social democracy]] and other evolutionary approaches to socialism. Revolutionary socialism is opposed to social movements that seek to gradually ameliorate the economic and social problems of capitalism through political reform.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], 1875]]\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote:<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007]</ref> {{quote|The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.

included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Men's standings==\n===Overall===\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n|\n{| cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid

included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Men's standings==\n===Overall===\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n|\n{| cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid

The name derives from \"rocky land\", as the area has been aptly described.\n\nRockland County is the smallest county by area in New York State outside [[New York City]]. It comprises five towns and nineteen incorporated villages, with numerous unincorporated villages (sixteen) and [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]]. Rockland County is designated as a [[List of Preserve America Communities|Preserve America Community]], and nearly a third of the county's area is parkland. The county has the largest [[American Jews|Jewish]] population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31.4%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockland County|url=https://www.ny.gov/counties/rockland|website=New York State|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> Rockland also ranked 31st on the list of highest-income counties by median [[household income in the United States]], with a median household income of $82,534 according to the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Rockland County, New York (1798\u20131900)}}\n[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Hudson]]'s ''Halve Maen'' (''Half Moon'') on the Hudson River]]\n[[File:SouthNyackNY CarsonMcCullersHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson McCullers House]] in South Nyack]]\n[[File:DeWint House Tappan.JPG|thumb|[[DeWint House]] (circa 1700) is the oldest home in Rockland County.]]\n[[File:RocklandCountyCourthouse.jpg|thumb|Historic [[Rockland County Courthouse and Dutch Gardens|Rockland County Courthouse]] in New City]]\n\nThe area that would become Rockland County was originally inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking Aboriginals, including [[Munsee]]s, or [[Lenni Lenape]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Henry Hudson]], thinking he had found the legendary \"[[Northwest Passage]]\", sailed on the ''Half Moon'' up the river that would one day bear his name and anchored near the area that is now [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]] before continuing to disillusionment north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675.<ref name=NY>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|title=County of Rockland, New York :: Home |publisher=Co.rockland.ny.us|accessdate=3 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104721/http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|archivedate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> These settlers, eager to escape \"city life\", moved from Manhattan to Rockland.  A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin. When the [[Duke of York]] (who became King [[James II of England]]) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], known then as ''\"Orange County South of the Mountains\"''. [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and [[Tappan, New York|Tappan]], the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.<ref name=NY/>\n\nThe natural barrier of the [[Ramapo Mountains]] and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]]. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n[[File:Lenapehoking.png|thumb|upright|The territory of the Lenape in present-day southern New York, New Jersey and eastern sections of Delaware and Pennsylvania]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], when control of the [[Hudson River]] was viewed by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw [[battle|skirmishes]] at Haverstraw, Nyack and [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and significant military engagements at the [[Battle of Stony Point]], where General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] earned his nickname. [[George Washington]] had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] met with American traitor [[Benedict Arnold]] near Stony Point to buy the plans for the [[fortification]]s at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]] at the [[DeWint House]], where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the [[Hudson Highlands]] on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] president [[E. H. Harriman]] donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]]/[[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.  After [[World War I]], Rockland county became the most important sausage making hub in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[https://italianfoodctr.com/ Italian Food Center (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[https://patch.com/new-york/pearlriver/italian-fest-returns-blauvelt Italian Fest Returns to Blauvelt (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/Calendar/index.php/name/9th-Annual-Blauvelt-Sons-of-Italy-Italian-Feast-Carnival/event/26440/ 9th Annual Blauvelt Sons of Italy Festival (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref>\n\nRockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s when the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], and other major arteries were built. The idea of [[suburbia]] also helped transform the county.

Republican Ed Day was first elected in 2013 and re-elected in 2017. The previous county executive was Republican C. Scott Vanderhoef, who was re-elected in 2009 to his fifth four-year term. Day is the third county executive in Rockland history, with Vanderhoef having defeated the incumbent, John T. Grant (D), in 1993. Prior to 1985, Rockland County did not have a county executive. County Executive Day was sworn in for his second term on January 1, 2018.\n\nThe county is divided into 17 single-member districts.<ref>[http://rocklandgov.com/elected-officials/ Elected Officials]</ref> The Chairman of the Legislature is Alden H.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest [[Appellate court|court of appeals]] in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles [[felony]] cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on [[misdemeanor]] cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and fifteen of the villages have [[Justice Courts]], which mostly hear routine [[traffic ticket]] cases, especially from the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. They also handle [[drunk driving]] charges, lower-level criminal [[misdemeanor]] matters, and occasionally perform [[arraignment]] on [[felonies]] (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\n===National politics===\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times\u2013[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide victory of [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s landslide victory in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first campaign in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican twice, in [[United States presidential election|2004]] for [[George W. Bush]] and [[United States presidential election|2016]] for [[Donald J. Trump]].Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin. When the [[Duke of York]] (who became King [[James II of England]]) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], known then as ''\"Orange County South of the Mountains\"''. [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and [[Tappan, New York|Tappan]], the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.<ref name=NY/>\n\nThe natural barrier of the [[Ramapo Mountains]] and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]]. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n[[File:Lenapehoking.png|thumb|upright|The territory of the Lenape in present-day southern New York, New Jersey and eastern sections of Delaware and Pennsylvania]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], when control of the [[Hudson River]] was viewed by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw [[battle|skirmishes]] at Haverstraw, Nyack and [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and significant military engagements at the [[Battle of Stony Point]], where General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] earned his nickname. [[George Washington]] had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] met with American traitor [[Benedict Arnold]] near Stony Point to buy the plans for the [[fortification]]s at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]] at the [[DeWint House]], where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the [[Hudson Highlands]] on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] president [[E. H. Harriman]] donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]]/[[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest [[Appellate court|court of appeals]] in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles [[felony]] cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on [[misdemeanor]] cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and fifteen of the villages have [[Justice Courts]], which mostly hear routine [[traffic ticket]] cases, especially from the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. They also handle [[drunk driving]] charges, lower-level criminal [[misdemeanor]] matters, and occasionally perform [[arraignment]] on [[felonies]] (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\n===National politics===\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times\u2013[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide victory of [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s landslide victory in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first campaign in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican twice, in [[United States presidential election|2004]] for [[George W. Bush]] and [[United States presidential election|2016]] for [[Donald J. Trump]].Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
