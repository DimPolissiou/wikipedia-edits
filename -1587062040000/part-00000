[[Whaling]], a school, and a [[Russian Orthodox]] church attracted many Tlingits to neighboring [[Killisnoo, Alaska|Killisnoo]].\n\nIn October 1882 of the village was destroyed in the [[Angoon Bombardment]] by US Naval forces under the command Commander [[Edgar C. Merriman]] and the ''[[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|USRC Thomas Corwin]]'' under the command of [[Michael A. Healy]]. The Tlingit villagers had taken white hostages and property and demanded two hundred [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|blankets]] in compensation from the [[North West Trading Company]] following the accidental death of a Tlingit [[Philosophy and religion of the Tlingit#Shamanism|shaman]] who died in a [[Harpoon cannon|whaling bomb]] accident while working on the whaler. The hostages were released upon the arrival of the naval expedition to Angoon, however Merriman demanded four hundred blankets in tribute and upon the Tlingit delivery of just eighty one blankets, Merriman's forces destroyed the village.<ref name=HarringCrow>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EHe_Ez7JXY4C&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=angoon+merriman&source=bl&ots=eUstAiynXj&sig=VrVKkm2_HtyemgJvsx5w2APUGzY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNt9y4iYnXAhULLsAKHZsPBOAQ6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&q=angoon%20merriman&f=false Crow Dog's Case: American Indian Sovereignty, Tribal Law, and United States Law in the Nineteenth Century], Sidney L.

In 1928, Killisnoo was destroyed by fire and many Tlingits returned to Angoon.\n\nIn 1973, Angoon won a U.S. $90,000 settlement from the United States government for the 1882 bombardment.\n\n==Geography==\nAngoon is located on the west side of [[Admiralty Island]] at {{Coord|57|29|49|N|134|34|25|W|type:city}} (57.496891, -134.573579).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the largest permanent settlement on Admiralty Island and is sited on an isthmus at the mouth of [[Kootznahoo Inlet]] on the west side of the island.

[[Whaling]], a school, and a [[Russian Orthodox]] church attracted many Tlingits to neighboring [[Killisnoo, Alaska|Killisnoo]].\n\nIn October 1882 of the village was destroyed in the [[Angoon Bombardment]] by US Naval forces under the command Commander [[Edgar C. Merriman]] and the ''[[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|USRC Thomas Corwin]]'' under the command of [[Michael A. Healy]]. The Tlingit villagers had taken white hostages and property and demanded two hundred [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|blankets]] in compensation from the [[North West Trading Company]] following the accidental death of a Tlingit [[Philosophy and religion of the Tlingit#Shamanism|shaman]] who died in a [[Harpoon cannon|whaling bomb]] accident while working on the whaler. The hostages were released upon the arrival of the naval expedition to Angoon, however Merriman demanded four hundred blankets in tribute and upon the Tlingit delivery of just eighty one blankets, Merriman's forces destroyed the village.<ref name=HarringCrow>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EHe_Ez7JXY4C&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=angoon+merriman&source=bl&ots=eUstAiynXj&sig=VrVKkm2_HtyemgJvsx5w2APUGzY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNt9y4iYnXAhULLsAKHZsPBOAQ6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&q=angoon%20merriman&f=false Crow Dog's Case: American Indian Sovereignty, Tribal Law, and United States Law in the Nineteenth Century], Sidney L.

In 1928, Killisnoo was destroyed by fire and many Tlingits returned to Angoon.\n\nIn 1973, Angoon won a U.S. $90,000 settlement from the United States government for the 1882 bombardment.\n\n==Geography==\nAngoon is located on the west side of [[Admiralty Island]] at {{Coord|57|29|49|N|134|34|25|W|type:city}} (57.496891, -134.573579).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the largest permanent settlement on Admiralty Island and is sited on an isthmus at the mouth of [[Kootznahoo Inlet]] on the west side of the island.

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] in 1910 by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]], who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about its distribution and ecology. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the presence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. The mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor'', who based his description of the species on four adult male [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Vietnam.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=O. |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').
