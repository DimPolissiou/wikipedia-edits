He is one of the most successful boxers of the past three decades, having held multiple world championships in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], including the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] [[middleweight]] title from 2004 to 2005, and the [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[light heavyweight]] title from 2011 to 2012.\n\nHopkins first became a world champion by winning the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] middleweight title in 1995. He would go on to compile 20 defenses against 17 boxers, with both those numbers remaining a record for the weight class. In 2001 he successfully unified the middleweight division by defeating [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]] to win the [[WBA (Super)]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'' magazine]], and lineal titles. A victory over [[Oscar De La Hoya]] for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title in 2004 cemented Hopkins' status as undisputed champion, while also making him the first male boxer to simultaneously hold world titles by all four major boxing sanctioning bodies. In 2001, Hopkins was voted Fighter of the Year by [[The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|''The Ring'' magazine]] and the [[Sugar Ray Robinson Award|Boxing Writers Association of America]]. In 2011, ''The Ring'' ranked Hopkins as third on their list of the \"10 best middleweight title holders of the last 50 years.\"<ref>Fischer, Doug.

Two defenses of the ''Ring'' title were made before a loss to [[Joe Calzaghe]] in 2008.

This made Hopkins the oldest boxer in history to win a world championship, at the age of 46, breaking [[George Foreman]]'s record set in 1994. Hopkins later broke his own record by winning the IBF light heavyweight title from [[Tavoris Cloud]] in 2013, and again in 2014 when he won the WBA (Super) title from [[Beibut Shumenov]], at ages 48 and 49, respectively.<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/2013/3/9/4084758/hopkins-vs-cloud-live-results-round-12 Hopkins vs Cloud live results: Round 12 \u2013 Bernard Hopkins wins unanimous decision to become oldest world champ ever].

He credits mastering the boxing fundamentals and a great defense for his longevity in the sport.

Hopkins turned to crime early in his life.  By the age of thirteen he was mugging people and had been stabbed three times. At seventeen, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in [[State Correctional Institution \u2013 Graterford|Graterford Prison]] for nine felonies. While in prison he witnessed the murder of another inmate in an argument over a pack of cigarettes, but also discovered his passion for boxing. After serving almost five years, Hopkins was released from prison in 1988. He then decided to use boxing as an escape from his previous life, and converted to [[Islam]].<ref>Steve Bunce (November 11, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/nov/11/boxing.news The forgotten prince] Guardian.

After a sixteen-month layoff, he resumed his career as a middleweight, winning a unanimous decision over Greg Paige at the [[The Blue Horizon|Blue Horizon]] on February 22, 1990.\n\nBetween February 1990 and December 1992, Hopkins scored 21 wins without a loss. He won 16 of those fights by [[knockout]], 12 coming in the first round.\n\n====Hopkins vs. Jones I====\nHopkins met Roy Jones on May 22, 1993 for the vacant IBF middleweight title. Hopkins was out-pointed throughout most of the fight, en route to losing a unanimous decision. All three judges scored the fight 116\u2013112 for Jones.\n\n===Middleweight title===\nThe IBF came again knocking at Hopkins's door on December 17 of that year, matching him with [[Segundo Mercado]] in Mercado's hometown of [[Quito, Ecuador]]. Mercado knocked Hopkins down twice before Hopkins rallied late and earned a draw.

By the end of 2000, he had defended the IBF title 12 times without a loss, while beating such standouts as [[John David Jackson (boxer)|John David Jackson]], [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]] (undefeated at the time), [[Simon Brown (boxer)|Simon Brown]], and [[Antwun Echols]].\n\n===2001 Middleweight Tournament===\nThe arrival of former [[welterweight]] and [[light middleweight]] champion [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]] into the middleweight ranks set off a series of unification fights between major middleweight title-holders. The boxers involved in the tournament would be reigning [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] champion Bernard Hopkins, [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion Keith Holmes, [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] champion William Joppy, and F\u00e9lix Trinidad.\n\n====Hopkins vs. Holmes====\nOn April 14, 2001, Hopkins won a unanimous decision over [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Keith Holmes (boxer)|Keith Holmes]] in New York City.

(The $100K came from a sponsorship deal Hopkins had with online casino site Golden Palace; Hopkins even had the [[GoldenPalace.com]] website displayed on his back for the fight.<ref>[http://www.boxingfutures.com/sites/default/files/Bernard-Hopkins.jpg JPG image of Hopkin's back]. boxingfutures.com</ref>) During promotion for the bout, Hopkins caused huge controversy by throwing the [[Puerto Rico]] flag on the floor in press conferences in both [[New York City]] and [[Puerto Rico]], the latter conference leading to a riot in which Hopkins had to be run to safety from the angry mob.<ref>Manuel Suarez (July 12, 2001).

Referee Steve Smoger called a halt to the fight after Trinidad's father (who was also his trainer) entered the ring to stop the fight. It was the first loss of Trinidad's career, and it made Hopkins the first undisputed world middleweight champion since [[Marvin Hagler]] in 1987. 'The Ring' magazine and the 'World Boxing Hall of Fame' named Hopkins as the 2001 Fighter of the Year.\n\nHe defended the undisputed title six times. Hopkins bested [[Carl Daniels]] on February 2 surpassing Carlos Monz\u00f3n's division record of 14 defenses, 2002, by tenth-round technical knockout; [[Morrade Hakkar]] on March 29, 2003, by eighth-round TKO; [[William Joppy]] on December 13, 2003, by unanimous decision; and [[Robert Allen (boxer)|Robert Allen]] on June 5, 2004, also by unanimous decision.\n\n===Undisputed middleweight champion===\n\n====Hopkins vs. De La Hoya====\n{{Main|Bernard Hopkins vs. Oscar De La Hoya}}\nIn the highest-paying fight of his career, Hopkins fought six-division titleholder [[Oscar De La Hoya]] for the undisputed middleweight championship on September 18, 2004, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

They fought on October 15, 2011. Hopkins lost via TKO for being unable to continue after injuring his shoulder when Dawson threw him off of his back.\n\nAfter an investigation by the WBC following a protest filed by [[Oscar De La Hoya]], the WBC ruled that Dawson intentionally fouled Hopkins and returned the belt to Hopkins. ''The Ring'' magazine also decided to continue to recognize Hopkins as their champion pending the California State Athletic Commission's ruling on a protest filed on behalf of Hopkins.<ref>[http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/169724-ring-light-heavweight-belt-wont-change-hands-pending-appeal RING light heavweight belt won't change hands pending appeal | RingTV].

The match was signed after neither fighter could secure a contest with WBC and lineal champion [[Adonis Stevenson]]. The fight took place at [[Boardwalk Hall]] in [[Atlantic City]] on November 8, 2014 and was televised by HBO; this marked the end of a feud between Hopkins' promoter Golden Boy Promotions and the network which saw HBO cut ties with Golden Boy fighters.\n\nIn a one-sided fight, Hopkins was knocked down in the first round by Kovalev.

Smith Jr. outboxed Hopkins through most of the first seven rounds, then,  in the 8th round, Smith caught Hopkins in the corner and landed five shots to the head that knocked him out of the ring. Hopkins said he was hurt and couldn't get back in the ring. He insisted that he had been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it was not a push. Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, \"He shoved me out of the ring. My ankle got twist when I fell out of the ring. I couldn't stand on my feet. If I wouldn't have been pushed out of the ring, I believe he was starting to fade... I can't believe they gave him a TKO. They can call it a no contest but not a loss.

They re-united in 2003, but split again in 2005, again with Fisher claiming to be underpaid, this time to the tune of $200,000. [[Naazim Richardson]], Fishers long-term assistant took over as Hopkins' head coach from 2005. Fisher won the [[Eddie Futch-John F.X.

Bouie died aged 83 in June 2011.\n\n==Controversies==\nOn December 7, 2007, Hopkins and Calzaghe met face to face in the media room set up for the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Ricky Hatton fight. Hopkins and Calzaghe began shouting insults and taunting each other, with Hopkins shouting, \"You're not even in my league! I would never let a white boy beat me. I would never lose to a white boy. I couldn't go back to the projects if I let a white boy beat me.\" Hopkins would later explain his comments, saying that it was not meant to be taken as a racial slur or a reflection of his feelings on white fighters, but simply said to create some hype for his fight with Calzaghe.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} On January 23, 2008, the fight was officially announced to take place on April 19, 2008, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. Hopkins lost the fight.\n\nIn late 2010, Hopkins suggested that African American fighters who possessed what he described as a \"slick\" inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]]. \"Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but I think that this is what is said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [in public] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the [[Sugar Ray Leonard|Ray Leonards]] or anyone like that would beat a guy [like Pacquiao] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2010/11/19/bernard-hopkins-wonders-why-pacquiao-hasnt-fought-any-top-notch-black-fighters |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526023814/http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2010/11/19/bernard-hopkins-wonders-why-pacquiao-hasnt-fought-any-top-notch-black-fighters/ |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>http://thewellversed.com/2010/11/19/bernard-hopkins-says-pacquiao-ducking-african-americans-mayweather-would-beat-him/</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2011, Hopkins questioned [[Minnesota Vikings]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]]'s racial credentials in a ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' online article.  Marcus Hayes of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' reported that according to Hopkins, McNabb had a privileged childhood in suburban Chicago and, as a result, is not black enough or tough enough, at least compared with, say, himself, Michael Vick and Terrell Owens. Hopkins said, \"He's got a [[acting white|suntan]]. That's all... McNabb is [[House Negro|the guy in the house]], while everybody else is on the field... He's the one who got the extra coat. The extra servings... He thought he was one of them.\"<ref>http://articles.philly.com/2011-05-11/sports/29532616_1_rich-burg-bernard-hopkins-donovan-mcnabb</ref>\n\nIn late 2013 he again suggested that African Americans possess a \"slick\" style of boxing which is superior to other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). \"The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, the way that they want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson \u2013 the great Robinson \u2013 would be boring today\u2026Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [their opponent] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [that] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right\u2026But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it\", said Hopkins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxing.com/b_hops_claim_racist.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322032649/http://www.boxing.com/b_hops_claim_racist.html |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|draws=2\n|nc=2\n|ko-wins=32\n|ko-losses=1\n|dec-wins=23\n|dec-losses=7\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Age\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|67\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|55\u20138\u20132 {{small|(2)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Joe Smith Jr.]]\n|KO\n|8 (12), {{small|0:53}}\n|Dec 17, 2016\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1965|1|15|2016|12|17}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Inglewood, California]], U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|For WBC International light heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|66\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|55\u20137\u20132 {{small|(2)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]]\n|UD\n|12\n|Nov 8, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1965|1|15|2014|11|8}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Lost WBA (Super) and IBF light heavyweight titles;<br />For [[list of WBO world champions#Light heavyweight|WBO light heavyweight title]]}}\n|-\n|65\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|55\u20136\u20132 {{small|(2)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|KAZ}} [[Beibut Shumenov]]\n|SD\n|12\n|Apr 19, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1965|1|15|2014|4|19}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[D.C.

He is one of the most successful boxers of the past three decades, having held multiple world championships in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], including the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] [[middleweight]] title from 2004 to 2005, and the [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[light heavyweight]] title from 2011 to 2012.\n\nHopkins first became a world champion by winning the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] middleweight title in 1995. He would go on to compile 20 defenses against 17 boxers, with both those numbers remaining a record for the weight class. In 2001 he successfully unified the middleweight division by defeating [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]] to win the [[WBA (Super)]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'' magazine]], and lineal titles. A victory over [[Oscar De La Hoya]] for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title in 2004 cemented Hopkins' status as undisputed champion, while also making him the first male boxer to simultaneously hold world titles by all four major boxing sanctioning bodies. In 2001, Hopkins was voted Fighter of the Year by [[The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|''The Ring'' magazine]] and the [[Sugar Ray Robinson Award|Boxing Writers Association of America]]. In 2011, ''The Ring'' ranked Hopkins as third on their list of the \"10 best middleweight title holders of the last 50 years.\"<ref>Fischer, Doug.

Two defenses of the ''Ring'' title were made before a loss to [[Joe Calzaghe]] in 2008. Three years later, Hopkins defeated [[Jean Pascal]] for the WBC and lineal light heavyweight titles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref> as well as regaining the ''Ring'' title. This made Hopkins the oldest boxer in history to win a world championship, at the age of 46, breaking [[George Foreman]]'s record set in 1994. Hopkins later broke his own record by winning the IBF light heavyweight title from [[Tavoris Cloud]] in 2013, and again in 2014 when he won the WBA (Super) title from [[Beibut Shumenov]], at ages 48 and 49, respectively.<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/2013/3/9/4084758/hopkins-vs-cloud-live-results-round-12 Hopkins vs Cloud live results: Round 12 \u2013 Bernard Hopkins wins unanimous decision to become oldest world champ ever].

Widely considered one of the greatest boxers of the modern era, he was a highly strategic and defensive boxer known for carrying good speed and power along with [[counterpunch (boxing)|counterpunching]] skills. He credits mastering the boxing fundamentals and a great defense for his longevity in the sport.

Hopkins turned to crime early in his life.  By the age of thirteen he was mugging people and had been stabbed three times. At seventeen, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in [[State Correctional Institution \u2013 Graterford|Graterford Prison]] for nine felonies. While in prison he witnessed the murder of another inmate in an argument over a pack of cigarettes, but also discovered his passion for boxing. After serving almost five years, Hopkins was released from prison in 1988. He then decided to use boxing as an escape from his previous life, and converted to [[Islam]].<ref>Steve Bunce (November 11, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/nov/11/boxing.news The forgotten prince] Guardian.

He won 16 of those fights by [[knockout]], 12 coming in the first round.\n\n====Hopkins vs. Jones I====\nHopkins met Roy Jones on May 22, 1993 for the vacant IBF middleweight title. Hopkins was out-pointed throughout most of the fight, en route to losing a unanimous decision. All three judges scored the fight 116\u2013112 for Jones.\n\n===Middleweight title===\nThe IBF came again knocking at Hopkins's door on December 17 of that year, matching him with [[Segundo Mercado]] in Mercado's hometown of [[Quito, Ecuador]].

By the end of 2000, he had defended the IBF title 12 times without a loss, while beating such standouts as [[John David Jackson (boxer)|John David Jackson]], [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]] (undefeated at the time), [[Simon Brown (boxer)|Simon Brown]], and [[Antwun Echols]].\n\n===2001 Middleweight Tournament===\nThe arrival of former [[welterweight]] and [[light middleweight]] champion [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]] into the middleweight ranks set off a series of unification fights between major middleweight title-holders.

'The Ring' magazine and the 'World Boxing Hall of Fame' named Hopkins as the 2001 Fighter of the Year.\n\nHe defended the undisputed title six times.

Hopkins won by split decision with scores of 113-114, 116-111 and 116-111, becoming the oldest boxer in history to unify titles in a weight division.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/bernard-hopkins-49-unifies-major-world-titles-with-split-decision-win-over-beibut-shumenov/2014/04/20/75d3ded4-c82d-11e3-8b9a-8e0977a24aeb_story.html|title=Boxing: Bernard Hopkins, 49, unifies titles with split decision win over Beibut Shumenov|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 20, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Hopkins vs. Kovalev====\n\nShortly after [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]] defeated [[Blake Caparello]] in a second-round knockout on August 2, 2014, Hopkins announced he would face the former in a match where his WBA Super and IBF titles would be on the line against Kovalev's WBO title. The match was signed after neither fighter could secure a contest with WBC and lineal champion [[Adonis Stevenson]]. The fight took place at [[Boardwalk Hall]] in [[Atlantic City]] on November 8, 2014 and was televised by HBO; this marked the end of a feud between Hopkins' promoter Golden Boy Promotions and the network which saw HBO cut ties with Golden Boy fighters.\n\nIn a one-sided fight, Hopkins was knocked down in the first round by Kovalev. Although he became the first fighter to take Kovalev past eight rounds, Hopkins lost every single round on all three judges' scorecards and took a 120-107, 120-107, 120-106 unanimous decision defeat, losing his titles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/11845755/sergey-kovalev-defeats-bernard-hopkins-unanimous-decision | title=Kovalev defeats Bernard Hopkins | accessdate=November 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Hopkins called out [[Carl Froch]] again stating he would like to fight him in a farewell match, only for Froch to decline the offer calling it a \"lose-lose situation\".

Hopkins also confirmed he would retire after this fight, whether it be at cruiserweight or light heavyweight, putting an end to his 28-year career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2016/10/10/bernard-hopkins-next-fight/?|title=Bernard Hopkins Next Fight To Come Before End Of 2016|date=2016-10-10|newspaper=Boxing News and Views|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/bernard-hopkin-final-fight-golden-boy-president-gives-status--109670?|title=Bernard Hopkin's Final Fight: Golden Boy President Gives Status - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10621920/ring-legend-bernard-hopkins-to-retire-from-boxing|title=Ring legend Bernard Hopkins to retire after farewell fight|last=|first=|date=October 18, 2016|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|access-date=October 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA deal was made in October for Hopkins to fight American boxer [[Joe Smith Jr.]], who last fought Fonfara in June knocking him out in less than 3 minutes.

Smith Jr. outboxed Hopkins through most of the first seven rounds, then,  in the 8th round, Smith caught Hopkins in the corner and landed five shots to the head that knocked him out of the ring. Hopkins said he was hurt and couldn't get back in the ring. He insisted that he had been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it was not a push. Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, \"He shoved me out of the ring. My ankle got twist when I fell out of the ring. I couldn't stand on my feet. If I wouldn't have been pushed out of the ring, I believe he was starting to fade... I can't believe they gave him a TKO. They can call it a no contest but not a loss. The momentum from his body pushed me. I went out like a soldier. I'm not in a denial.\" Hopkins sat down with HBO's [[Max Kellerman]] in the locker room after the fight and confirmed this would be his final fight. Smith Jr. retained his WBC International light heavyweight title. Hopkins' reported purse was $800,000, compared to Smith's $140,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/38356048|title=Bernard Hopkins beaten by TKO in final fight of career|last=|first=|date=December 18, 2016|website=BBC Boxing|publisher=|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/boxing/2016/12/18/bernard-hopkins-knocked-out-ring-retirement-bout/95581282/|title=Bernard Hopkins knocked out of ring in retirement bout|last=|first=|date=December 17, 2016|website=USA Today|publisher=|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/18301362/bernard-hopkins-knocked-ring-joe-smith-jr-final-fight-ex-champ-career|title=Bernard Hopkins knocked out of ring by Joe Smith Jr. in final fight|last=|first=|date=December 18, 2016|website=ESPN|publisher=|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> According to RingTV, the fight averaged 934,000 viewers, peaking at 1.035m on HBO.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ringtv.com/478102-million-turn-hbo-see-hopkins-final-fight/|title=More than a million turn to HBO to see Hopkins' final fight - The Ring|date=2016-12-20|newspaper=The Ring|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/hopkins-smith-averaged-934k-viewers-peaks-1035-million--111951|title=Hopkins-Smith Averaged 934K Viewers; Peaks at 1.035 Million - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==Coaches==\nHopkins was coached by Philadelphia-based [[English \"Bouie\" Fisher]] from 1989 until their split in 2002 which resulted in Fisher taking Hopkins to court, claiming he was underpaid by $255,000. They re-united in 2003, but split again in 2005, again with Fisher claiming to be underpaid, this time to the tune of $200,000. [[Naazim Richardson]], Fishers long-term assistant took over as Hopkins' head coach from 2005. Fisher won the [[Eddie Futch-John F.X. Condon Award, awarded by the Boxing Writers Association of America, for Trainer of the Year]] in 2001. Bouie died aged 83 in June 2011.\n\n==Controversies==\nOn December 7, 2007, Hopkins and Calzaghe met face to face in the media room set up for the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Ricky Hatton fight. Hopkins and Calzaghe began shouting insults and taunting each other, with Hopkins shouting, \"You're not even in my league! I would never let a white boy beat me. I would never lose to a white boy. I couldn't go back to the projects if I let a white boy beat me.\" Hopkins would later explain his comments, saying that it was not meant to be taken as a racial slur or a reflection of his feelings on white fighters, but simply said to create some hype for his fight with Calzaghe.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} On January 23, 2008, the fight was officially announced to take place on April 19, 2008, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. Hopkins lost the fight.\n\nIn late 2010, Hopkins suggested that African American fighters who possessed what he described as a \"slick\" inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]]. \"Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but I think that this is what is said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [in public] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the [[Sugar Ray Leonard|Ray Leonards]] or anyone like that would beat a guy [like Pacquiao] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2010/11/19/bernard-hopkins-wonders-why-pacquiao-hasnt-fought-any-top-notch-black-fighters |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526023814/http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2010/11/19/bernard-hopkins-wonders-why-pacquiao-hasnt-fought-any-top-notch-black-fighters/ |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>http://thewellversed.com/2010/11/19/bernard-hopkins-says-pacquiao-ducking-african-americans-mayweather-would-beat-him/</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2011, Hopkins questioned [[Minnesota Vikings]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]]'s racial credentials in a ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' online article.  Marcus Hayes of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' reported that according to Hopkins, McNabb had a privileged childhood in suburban Chicago and, as a result, is not black enough or tough enough, at least compared with, say, himself, Michael Vick and Terrell Owens. Hopkins said, \"He's got a [[acting white|suntan]]. That's all... McNabb is [[House Negro|the guy in the house]], while everybody else is on the field... He's the one who got the extra coat. The extra servings... He thought he was one of them.\"<ref>http://articles.philly.com/2011-05-11/sports/29532616_1_rich-burg-bernard-hopkins-donovan-mcnabb</ref>\n\nIn late 2013 he again suggested that African Americans possess a \"slick\" style of boxing which is superior to other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). \"The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, the way that they want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson \u2013 the great Robinson \u2013 would be boring today\u2026Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [their opponent] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [that] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right\u2026But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it\", said Hopkins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxing.com/b_hops_claim_racist.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322032649/http://www.boxing.com/b_hops_claim_racist.html |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|draws=2\n|nc=2\n|ko-wins=32\n|ko-losses=1\n|dec-wins=23\n|dec-losses=7\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Age\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|67\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|55\u20138\u20132 {{small|(2)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Joe Smith Jr.]]\n|KO\n|8 (12), {{small|0:53}}\n|Dec 17, 2016\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1965|1|15|2016|12|17}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Inglewood, California]], U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|For WBC International light heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|66\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|55\u20137\u20132 {{small|(2)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]]\n|UD\n|12\n|Nov 8, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1965|1|15|2014|11|8}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Lost WBA (Super) and IBF light heavyweight titles;<br />For [[list of WBO world champions#Light heavyweight|WBO light heavyweight title]]}}\n|-\n|65\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|55\u20136\u20132 {{small|(2)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|KAZ}} [[Beibut Shumenov]]\n|SD\n|12\n|Apr 19, 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1965|1|15|2014|4|19}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[D.C.

In 1870 he graduated from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Saint Petersburg University,<ref name=bse/> and afterwards, between 1878 and 1881, worked at the workshop of Bandera-Galician railways. In 1878 he created a telephone of original construction, the so-called phone vibrator.<ref name=bse/> He continued making major inventions in the 1880s, and in 1882 designed a multi-pole phone. By this time phone lines were introduced to many cities around the world; however, their quality was poor. So in 1883, at the [[Munich]] electrical exhibition, an expert commission concluded that the existing systems were suitable for the transmission of sound to distances of only up to ten kilometers.\n\nGolubitsky found that the low sensitivity and poor stability of the existing phones originated from the action of the magnetic field to the center of the membrane, which formed a node of vibration. He changed the phone design to removing the source of such interference. In his design the two poles of the magnet were located eccentrically relatively to the center of the membrane, so that no additional deformation was induced. In 1883 his phone was brought to Europe to connect [[Paris]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. It was further tested by the commission of the French Navy up to a distance of 350 km, and received excellent evaluations.\n\nIn 1883 Golubitsky developed a telephone setup for railways, which was installed at the Nikolaev railway. During the same year he improved the microphone in his setup by filling it with carbon powder. In 1884 he began testing a telephone system connecting the train operator to any railway station; this system was certified and adopted by the Russian railways in 1888. In 1885 he suggested the use of a common battery supply for multiple phones located nearby, which resulted in the appearance of telephone stations and phone networks. In 1886 he invented a [[commutator]] allowing multiple phones to used a single electrical lines.<ref name=bse/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090911043502/http://kpk-user.ru/articles/1207-istorija-vozniknovenija-telefona-i-mobilnojj.html \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438]. kpk-user.ru</ref>\n\n== Books ==\n[[File:Pavel Golubitzky 2020 stamp of Russia.jpg|thumb|Golubitzky on a 2020 stamp of Russia]]\n* {{cite book|author=Golubitsky, P. |trans-title=Telephony in Berlin|title=\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435|place=Moscow|year=1885}}\n* {{cite book|author=Golubitsky, P. |trans-title=Application of telephony at railways|title=\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0445|place= Moscow|publisher= Rassvet|year= 1890}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Pavel Golubitsky}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Golubitzky, Pavel}}\n[[Category:1845 births]]\n[[Category:1911 deaths]]\n[[Category:Russian inventors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox scientist\n| name        = Pavel Golubitsky\n| image       = File:Pavel Golubitsky.jpg\n| birth_date  = 16 (28) March 1845<ref name=bse>[http://endic.ru/enc_sovet/Golubicki-pavel-mihalovich-9821.html \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447].

Especially the German and French operators have discontinued their sleeper services. This includes all sleeper connections to Copenhagen, making it impossible to travel by train Oslo\u2013Brussels without an intermediate hotel night or using seated trains with long nightly changes.\nThe longest daytime journeys are taken by the [[Hamburg]] to [[Budapest]] service.\n\nServices to and from Russia and [[Ukraine]] (traditionally targeted at poorer demographics) resisted longer, but these, too, have been reduced and reinvented in recent years. As of 2015, there are 3 services connecting Moscow with Western Europe, which are by far the longest ones on the European continent. These now feature luxurious sleeper cars and are targeted primarily at wealthier customers, with ticket prices well exceeding air fare. Most services connecting [[Kiev]] with Western Europe have been discontinued all together (due to the poor Ukrainian railway infrastructure being a significant contributing factor), with one lasting daily train to [[Budapest]], taking more than 24 hours to complete its journey.\n\n==== International services ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ \n|-\n!

Especially the German and French operators have discontinued their sleeper services. This includes all sleeper connections to Copenhagen, making it impossible to travel by train Oslo\u2013Brussels without an intermediate hotel night or using seated trains with long nightly changes.\nThe longest daytime journeys are taken by the [[Hamburg]] to [[Budapest]] service.\n\nServices to and from Russia and [[Ukraine]] (traditionally targeted at poorer demographics) resisted longer, but these, too, have been reduced and reinvented in recent years. As of 2015, there are 3 services connecting Moscow with Western Europe, which are by far the longest ones on the European continent. These now feature luxurious sleeper cars and are targeted primarily at wealthier customers, with ticket prices well exceeding air fare. Most services connecting [[Kiev]] with Western Europe have been discontinued all together (due to the poor Ukrainian railway infrastructure being a significant contributing factor), with one lasting daily train to [[Budapest]], taking more than 24 hours to complete its journey.\n\n==== International services ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ \n|-\n!

The financial crisis aggravated by France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was one of many contributing factors to the French Revolution. Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|discovery of oxygen]] (1778) and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]] (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse|Lap\u00e9rouse]], took part in the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[authority]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.\n\n===Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)===\n{{Main|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799)|French Revolution}}\n[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the [[French Revolution]].]]\nFacing financial troubles, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] summoned the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] (gathering the three [[Estates of the realm]]) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the [[Commoner|Third Estate]] formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], signalling the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]]. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents [[Storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, a date which would become [[Bastille Day|France's National Day]].\n\nIn early August 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] [[August Decrees|abolished the privileges]] of the [[French nobility|nobility]] such as [[Serfdom|personal serfdom]] and exclusive hunting rights.\nThrough the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789|Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth.\n\nIn November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous [[flight to Varennes]] (June 1791) seemed to justify rumors he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the [[Abolition of monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\n\nIn August 1791, the Emperor of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the [[French Constitution of 1791]], thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|constitutional monarchy]]. In the newly established [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the '[[Girondins]]', who favored war with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and a group later called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s', who opposed such a war. A majority in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they [[French Revolutionary Wars|declared war on Austria]].{{efn-ur|The present-day state of Austria did not exist as such, its territory was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] which also comprised the present-day states of Hungary, [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648\u20131867)|Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia#Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131918)|Slovakia]], Belgium, [[Slovenia#The Middle Ages to the early modern period|Slovenia]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]: that Habsburg Monarchy was usually called 'Austria'.}}\n\n[[File:Serment du Jeu de Paume - Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Tennis Court Oath (David)|''Le Serment du Jeu de paume'']] by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1791]]\nOn 10 August 1792, an angry crowd [[Insurrection of 10 August 1792|threatened the palace of King Louis XVI]], who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.<ref name=Shus-5 /><ref>Censer, Jack R. and Hunt, Lynn.

In that year, French troops conquered Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]] in 1798.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational [[European Union]], notably by signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the [[Eurozone]] in 1999, and signing the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025215249/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html |archivedate=25 October 2005 |title=Declaration by the Franco-German Defense and Security Council |publisher=Elysee.fr |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref> France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpfrance-otan.org/France-and-NATO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509044211/http://www.rpfrance-otan.org/France-and-NATO |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 May 2014 |title=France and NATO |work=La France \u00e0 l'Otan}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Strasbourg manifestation Charlie Hebdo 11 janvier 2015-2.jpg|thumb|alt=Place de la R\u00e9publique statue column with large French flag|[[Republican marches]] were organised across France after the [[January 2015 \u00cele-de-France attacks]] perpetrated by radicalised [[Islamist]] extremist [[terrorist]]s; they are the largest public rallies in French history.]]\nSince the 19th century France has received many [[Immigration to France|immigrants]].

It is bordered by the [[Northern Sea]] in the north, the [[English Channel]] in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as ''{{lang|fr|l'Hexagone}}'' (\"The [[Hexagon]]\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is [[Corsica]]. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41\u00b0]] and [[51st parallel north|51\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6\u00b0 W]] and [[10th meridian east|10\u00b0 E]], on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zone. Its continental part covers about 1000&nbsp;km from north to south and from east to west.\n\nFrance has several [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas regions]] across the world, which are organized as follows:\n* In South America: [[French Guiana]].\n* In the Atlantic Ocean: [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and, in the Antilles: [[Guadeloupe]], Martinique, [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]].\n* In the Pacific Ocean: [[French Polynesia]], the special collectivity of [[New Caledonia]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[Clipperton Island]].\n* In the Indian Ocean: [[R\u00e9union island]], [[Mayotte]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Crozet Islands]], [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|St. Paul]] and [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] islands, and the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]]\n* In the Antarctic: [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]].\n\nFrance has land borders with Brazil and Suriname via [[French Guiana]] and with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French portion of [[Saint Martin]].\n\nMetropolitan France covers {{convert|551500|km2|sqmi|0}},<ref name=France /> the largest among [[European Union]] members.<ref name = superficy>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france/index_en.htm |title=Europa Official Site&nbsp;\u2013 France |accessdate=28 October 2014 |publisher=EU}}</ref> France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]]), is {{convert|643801|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, 0.45% of the total land area on Earth.

Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the [[Armorican Massif]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Morvan]], the [[Vosges]] and [[Ardennes]] ranges and the island of [[Corsica]] were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie.

In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], wrote about the management of prisons: ''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''

While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (''\u00e9cole maternelle'') and elementary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialization and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (''coll\u00e8ge'') and leads to the national certificate ([[Dipl\u00f4me national du brevet]]). The second is offered in high schools (''lyc\u00e9e'') and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (''baccalaur\u00e9at'', available in professional, technical or general flavors) or certificate of professional competence (''certificat d'aptitude professionelle'').\n\n[[Education in France#Higher education|Higher education]] is divided between [[Universities in France|public universities]] and the prestigious and selective ''[[Grandes \u00e9coles]]'', such as [[Sciences Po Paris]] for Political studies, [[HEC Paris]] for Economics, [[Polytechnique]], the [[\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]] for Social studies and the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des mines de Paris]] that produce high-profile engineers, or the [[\u00c9cole nationale d'administration]] for careers in the [[Grands corps de l'\u00c9tat|Grands Corps]] of the state.

[[Jean Fouquet]], the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting [[School of Fontainebleau]] was directly inspired by Italian painters such as [[Primaticcio]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]], who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of [[Baroque era]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy.\n\n[[File:Claude Monet 023.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=painting by Claude Monet of woman with parasol facing left in field from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay|[[Claude Monet]] founded the [[Impressionist]] movement (''Femme avec un parasol'', 1886, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]).]]\nThe 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists.\n\nFrench artists developed the [[rococo]] style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon]] favoured artists of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and the highly influential [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts]] defined the style known as [[Academism]]. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], a style that eventually evolved into [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]].\n[[File:Le Penseur in the Jardin du Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris 14 June 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Thinker bronze statue from 1902 from the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris|''[[The Thinker|Le Penseur]]'' by [[Auguste Rodin]] (1902), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]], Paris]]\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].

The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century, [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |title=Urbanisme : Des gratte-ciel \u00e0 Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?nbsp;\u2013 Posez vos questions |publisher=MYTF1News |author=Henri SECKEL |date=8 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029152433/http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 }}</ref> France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.<ref>[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729154317/http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html |date=29 July 2010 }}&nbsp;\u2013 NCI Business Center</ref> Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]].

There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' and ''[[Lancelot-Grail]]''. Other authors are known, for example [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].\n\nMuch medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and the various [[chansons de geste]]. The ''Roman de Renart'', written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], whose novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' has remained famous and appreciated until now. [[Michel de Montaigne]] was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', created the literary genre of the essay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |title=Montaigne |publisher=Humanistictexts.org |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525201508/http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011  }}</ref> [[French poetry]] during that century was embodied by [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]].

[[Modern philosophy]] began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. Descartes revitalised [[Western philosophy]], which had been declined after the Greek and Roman eras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.friesian.com/hist-2.htm |title=The Beginning of Modern Sciences |publisher=Friesian.com |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> His ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Frans Hals painting of Ren\u00e9 Descartes facing right in black coat and white collar|[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], founder of modern philosophy]]\n\nFrench philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Baron de Montesquieu]] theorised the principle of [[separation of powers]], which has been implemented in all [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] since [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|it was first applied in the United States]]. [[Voltaire]] came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.\n\n19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Auguste Comte]], who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Louis de Bonald]] and [[Hugues Felicit\u00e9 Robert de Lamennais|F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Robert de Lamennais]], who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre is considered, together with the Englishman [[Edmund Burke]], one of the founders of European conservatism, while Comte is regarded as the founder of [[positivism]], which [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] reformulated as a basis for social research.\n\nIn the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]] thrived with thinkers such as [[Henri Bergson]] and it influenced American [[pragmatism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s version of [[process philosophy]]. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with [[Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Jean Cavaill\u00e8s]] and [[Jules Vuillemin]]. Influenced by German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], the philosophy of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of [[postmodern philosophy]] with [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]].\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of France}}\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of [[French opera]] and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.<ref>Girdlestone p. 14: \"It is customary to couple him with Couperin as one couples Haydn with Mozart or Ravel with Debussy.\"</ref>{{full citation needed |date=January 2018}}\n\n[[File:Hector-Berlioz-1845.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Hector Berlioz]]]]\nFrench composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the [[Romantic music]] era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: [[Hector Berlioz]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''), [[Georges Bizet]] (best known for ''[[Carmen]]'', which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]] (best known for his ''[[Pavane (Faur\u00e9)|Pavane]]'', [[Requiem (Faur\u00e9)|''Requiem'']], and ''[[Faur\u00e9 Nocturnes|nocturnes]]''), [[Charles Gounod]] (best known for his ''[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]'' and his opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''), [[Jacques Offenbach]] (best known for his 100 [[operetta]]s of the 1850s\u20131870s and his uncompleted opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''), [[\u00c9douard Lalo]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie espagnole]]'' for violin and orchestra and his [[Cello Concerto (Lalo)|Cello Concerto in D minor]]), [[Jules Massenet]] (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are ''[[Manon]]'' (1884) and ''[[Werther]]'' (1892)) and [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (he has many frequently-performed works, including ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Danse macabre]]'', ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Opera), ''[[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Symphony No. 3]]).\n\n[[File:Claude Debussy atelier Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Debussy]]]]\nLater came precursors of modern classical music.

As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the [[Commoner|Third Estate]] formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], signalling the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]]. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents [[Storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, a date which would become [[Bastille Day|France's National Day]].\n\nIn early August 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] [[August Decrees|abolished the privileges]] of the [[French nobility|nobility]] such as [[Serfdom|personal serfdom]] and exclusive hunting rights.\nThrough the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789|Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth.\n\nIn November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous [[flight to Varennes]] (June 1791) seemed to justify rumors he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the [[Abolition of monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\n\nIn August 1791, the Emperor of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the [[French Constitution of 1791]], thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|constitutional monarchy]]. In the newly established [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the '[[Girondins]]', who favored war with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and a group later called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s', who opposed such a war. A majority in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies.

On 6 June 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Invasion of Normandy|invaded Normandy]] and in August they [[Operation Dragoon|invaded Provence]]. Over the following year the Allies and the [[French Resistance]] emerged victorious over the [[Axis powers]] and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|wage war against Germany]] and to [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|purge collaborators from office]]. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a [[Social security in France|social security]] system).\n[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Charles de Gaulle seated in uniform looking left with folded arms|[[Charles de Gaulle]] took an active part in many major events of the 20th century: a hero of World War I, leader of the [[Free French Forces|Free French]] during [[World War II]], he then became [[President of France|President]], where he facilitated decolonisation, maintained France as a major power and overcame the [[May 1968 in France|revolt of May 1968]].]]\n\nThe GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], which saw spectacular economic growth (''les [[Trente Glorieuses]]'').

To this end, he withdrew from [[NATO]]'s military integrated command (while remaining in the NATO alliance itself), launched a [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development programme]], and made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty|restored]] cordial [[Franco-German relations]] to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring a Europe of [[Sovereign state|sovereign nations]]. In the wake of the series of worldwide [[protests of 1968]], the [[May 1968 in France|revolt of May 1968]] had an enormous social impact. In France, it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal ([[secularism]], [[individualism]], [[sexual revolution]]). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.\n\nIn the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|economies in the world]], but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational [[European Union]], notably by signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the [[Eurozone]] in 1999, and signing the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025215249/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html |archivedate=25 October 2005 |title=Declaration by the Franco-German Defense and Security Council |publisher=Elysee.fr |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref> France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpfrance-otan.org/France-and-NATO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509044211/http://www.rpfrance-otan.org/France-and-NATO |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 May 2014 |title=France and NATO |work=La France \u00e0 l'Otan}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Strasbourg manifestation Charlie Hebdo 11 janvier 2015-2.jpg|thumb|alt=Place de la R\u00e9publique statue column with large French flag|[[Republican marches]] were organised across France after the [[January 2015 \u00cele-de-France attacks]] perpetrated by radicalised [[Islamist]] extremist [[terrorist]]s; they are the largest public rallies in French history.]]\nSince the 19th century France has received many [[Immigration to France|immigrants]].

It is bordered by the [[Northern Sea]] in the north, the [[English Channel]] in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as ''{{lang|fr|l'Hexagone}}'' (\"The [[Hexagon]]\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is [[Corsica]]. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41\u00b0]] and [[51st parallel north|51\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6\u00b0 W]] and [[10th meridian east|10\u00b0 E]], on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zone. Its continental part covers about 1000&nbsp;km from north to south and from east to west.\n\nFrance has several [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas regions]] across the world, which are organized as follows:\n* In South America: [[French Guiana]].\n* In the Atlantic Ocean: [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and, in the Antilles: [[Guadeloupe]], Martinique, [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]].\n* In the Pacific Ocean: [[French Polynesia]], the special collectivity of [[New Caledonia]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[Clipperton Island]].\n* In the Indian Ocean: [[R\u00e9union island]], [[Mayotte]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Crozet Islands]], [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|St. Paul]] and [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] islands, and the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]]\n* In the Antarctic: [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]].\n\nFrance has land borders with Brazil and Suriname via [[French Guiana]] and with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French portion of [[Saint Martin]].\n\nMetropolitan France covers {{convert|551500|km2|sqmi|0}},<ref name=France /> the largest among [[European Union]] members.<ref name = superficy>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france/index_en.htm |title=Europa Official Site&nbsp;\u2013 France |accessdate=28 October 2014 |publisher=EU}}</ref> France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]]), is {{convert|643801|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, 0.45% of the total land area on Earth.

Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the [[Armorican Massif]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Morvan]], the [[Vosges]] and [[Ardennes]] ranges and the island of [[Corsica]] were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie.

That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]\n\nFrench law is divided into two principal areas: [[private law]] and [[public law]]. Private law includes, in particular, [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]. Public law includes, in particular, [[administrative law]] and [[constitutional law]]. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law.

However, \"offences against [[Decency|public decency]]\" (''contraires aux bonnes m\u0153urs'') or [[breach of the peace|disturbing public order]] (''trouble \u00e0 l'ordre public'') have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.

The first is delivered through colleges (''coll\u00e8ge'') and leads to the national certificate ([[Dipl\u00f4me national du brevet]]). The second is offered in high schools (''lyc\u00e9e'') and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (''baccalaur\u00e9at'', available in professional, technical or general flavors) or certificate of professional competence (''certificat d'aptitude professionelle'').\n\n[[Education in France#Higher education|Higher education]] is divided between [[Universities in France|public universities]] and the prestigious and selective ''[[Grandes \u00e9coles]]'', such as [[Sciences Po Paris]] for Political studies, [[HEC Paris]] for Economics, [[Polytechnique]], the [[\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]] for Social studies and the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des mines de Paris]] that produce high-profile engineers, or the [[\u00c9cole nationale d'administration]] for careers in the [[Grands corps de l'\u00c9tat|Grands Corps]] of the state.

[[Jean Fouquet]], the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting [[School of Fontainebleau]] was directly inspired by Italian painters such as [[Primaticcio]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]], who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of [[Baroque era]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy.\n\n[[File:Claude Monet 023.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=painting by Claude Monet of woman with parasol facing left in field from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay|[[Claude Monet]] founded the [[Impressionist]] movement (''Femme avec un parasol'', 1886, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]).]]\nThe 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists.\n\nFrench artists developed the [[rococo]] style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon]] favoured artists of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and the highly influential [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts]] defined the style known as [[Academism]]. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], a style that eventually evolved into [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]].\n[[File:Le Penseur in the Jardin du Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris 14 June 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Thinker bronze statue from 1902 from the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris|''[[The Thinker|Le Penseur]]'' by [[Auguste Rodin]] (1902), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]], Paris]]\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].

The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century, [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |title=Urbanisme : Des gratte-ciel \u00e0 Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?nbsp;\u2013 Posez vos questions |publisher=MYTF1News |author=Henri SECKEL |date=8 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029152433/http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 }}</ref> France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.<ref>[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729154317/http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html |date=29 July 2010 }}&nbsp;\u2013 NCI Business Center</ref> Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]].

There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' and ''[[Lancelot-Grail]]''. Other authors are known, for example [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].\n\nMuch medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and the various [[chansons de geste]]. The ''Roman de Renart'', written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], whose novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' has remained famous and appreciated until now. [[Michel de Montaigne]] was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', created the literary genre of the essay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |title=Montaigne |publisher=Humanistictexts.org |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525201508/http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011  }}</ref> [[French poetry]] during that century was embodied by [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]].

De Maistre is considered, together with the Englishman [[Edmund Burke]], one of the founders of European conservatism, while Comte is regarded as the founder of [[positivism]], which [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] reformulated as a basis for social research.\n\nIn the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]] thrived with thinkers such as [[Henri Bergson]] and it influenced American [[pragmatism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s version of [[process philosophy]]. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with [[Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Jean Cavaill\u00e8s]] and [[Jules Vuillemin]]. Influenced by German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], the philosophy of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of [[postmodern philosophy]] with [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]].\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of France}}\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of [[French opera]] and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.<ref>Girdlestone p. 14: \"It is customary to couple him with Couperin as one couples Haydn with Mozart or Ravel with Debussy.\"</ref>{{full citation needed |date=January 2018}}\n\n[[File:Hector-Berlioz-1845.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Hector Berlioz]]]]\nFrench composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the [[Romantic music]] era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: [[Hector Berlioz]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''), [[Georges Bizet]] (best known for ''[[Carmen]]'', which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]] (best known for his ''[[Pavane (Faur\u00e9)|Pavane]]'', [[Requiem (Faur\u00e9)|''Requiem'']], and ''[[Faur\u00e9 Nocturnes|nocturnes]]''), [[Charles Gounod]] (best known for his ''[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]'' and his opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''), [[Jacques Offenbach]] (best known for his 100 [[operetta]]s of the 1850s\u20131870s and his uncompleted opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''), [[\u00c9douard Lalo]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie espagnole]]'' for violin and orchestra and his [[Cello Concerto (Lalo)|Cello Concerto in D minor]]), [[Jules Massenet]] (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are ''[[Manon]]'' (1884) and ''[[Werther]]'' (1892)) and [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (he has many frequently-performed works, including ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Danse macabre]]'', ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Opera), ''[[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Symphony No. 3]]).\n\n[[File:Claude Debussy atelier Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Debussy]]]]\nLater came precursors of modern classical music. [[\u00c9rik Satie]] was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian [[avant-garde]], best known for his ''[[Gymnop\u00e9dies]]''. [[Francis Poulenc]]'s best known works are his piano suite ''[[Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels]]'' (1919), the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' (1923), the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1928) for [[harpsichord]] and orchestra, the opera ''[[Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]'' (1957), and the ''[[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]]'' (1959) for [[soprano]], choir and orchestra. [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] are the most prominent figures associated with [[Impressionist music]]. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and [[chromaticism]] influenced many composers who followed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/claude-debussy-mn0000768781/biography |title=Claude Debussy&nbsp;\u2013 Biography&nbsp;\u2013 AllMusic |author=Allen Schrott |website=AllMusic}}</ref> Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of [[atonality]].

Azuga is located at the foot of the [[Baiu Mountains|Baiu mountains]], and contains the longest ski run in Romania, the Sorica - together with other ski slopes.\nFormerly heavy industrialized, Azuga retains now a bottled water factory - a leftover from the famous [[beer]] factory that brewed Azuga Beer (now produced elsewhere in Romania under license), a sparkling wine factory, [[wine tasting]] and lodging (Cramele Rhein, owned by [[Halewood International]]).\nThe beer factory, the glassware factory and the wool cloth factory were privatized and now are closed and completely demolished. The refractory materials factory, also privatized, is still standing but it is closed.\nThe town offers a dramatic view over the [[Bucegi Mountains|Bucegi mountains]], even from street level and especially from the top of the Sorica mountain (at the gondola arrival station).\n\nAzuga is one of the most famous mountain resorts of [[Prahova valley|Prahova Valley]]. Tourists who decide to spend their winter vacation in Azuga, have two of the best ski slopes in the country: Sorica and Cazacu, together with a large offer for lodging. Until the winter of 2002, Azuga was known as an industrial town but thanks to the particularly mountain landscape offered by the Baiului Mountains, the town was turned into a resort. Shortly after, Sorica slope has been certified by the [[International Ski Federation]]. Today in Azuga are many hotels and hostels that can provide accommodation for tourists.

Azuga is located at the foot of the [[Baiu Mountains|Baiu mountains]], and contains the longest ski run in Romania, the Sorica - together with other ski slopes.\nFormerly heavy industrialized, Azuga retains now a bottled water factory - a leftover from the famous [[beer]] factory that brewed Azuga Beer (now produced elsewhere in Romania under license), a sparkling wine factory, [[wine tasting]] and lodging (Cramele Rhein, owned by [[Halewood International]]).\nThe beer factory, the glassware factory and the wool cloth factory were privatized and now are closed and completely demolished. The refractory materials factory, also privatized, is still standing but it is closed.\nThe town offers a dramatic view over the [[Bucegi Mountains|Bucegi mountains]], even from street level and especially from the top of the Sorica mountain (at the gondola arrival station).\n\nAzuga is one of the most famous mountain resorts of [[Prahova valley|Prahova Valley]]. Tourists who decide to spend their winter vacation in Azuga, have two of the best ski slopes in the country: Sorica and Cazacu, together with a large offer for lodging. Until the winter of 2002, Azuga was known as an industrial town but thanks to the particularly mountain landscape offered by the Baiului Mountains, the town was turned into a resort. Shortly after, Sorica slope has been certified by the [[International Ski Federation]]. Today in Azuga are many hotels and hostels that can provide accommodation for tourists. Another option is the accommodation in local homes at lower prices.\n\n==Tourism==\nThe town is an emerging ski resort that sees tremendous development in tourism infrastructure.\n\nOn Sorica slope enthusiasts of winter sports can ski over a length of 2100 meters (vertical drop 561 m).

Although this was not the case, her experiences during the war formed the foundation for her later discovery of the importance of sanitary conditions in hospitals, a critical component of intensive care.\n\nIn 1950, [[anesthesiologist]] [[Peter Safar]] established the concept of \"Advanced life support\", keeping [[patient]]s sedated and ventilated in an intensive care environment. Safar is considered to be the first practitioner of intensive care medicine as a speciality.\n\nIn response to a [[polio]] [[epidemic]] (where many patients required constant ventilation and surveillance), [[Bj\u00f8rn Aage Ibsen]] established the first intensive care unit in [[Copenhagen]] in 1953.<ref>{{citation | title = Der d\u00e4nische An\u00e4sthesist Bj\u00f6rn Ibsen ein Pionier der Langzeitbeatmung \u00fcber die oberen Luftwege | last = Reisner-S\u00e9n\u00e9lar | first = L. | work = Doctoral Thesis | year = 2009 | location = Frankfurt am Main, Germany | language = German | oclc = 600186486 | publisher = Johann Wolfgang Goethe University | url = http://d-nb.info/999147323/34}}.

This subject is complicated by the fact that optimal ICU staffing may depend on ICU characteristics.\n* Despite calls for all ICUs to function as closed-model units with intensivists as the primary physician of record, evidence supporting this view is contradictory. Likewise, studies of around-the-clock intensivist presence have not consistently shown that it is associated with superior outcomes.\n* The data do not supply a consistent answer to the question of whether ICUs would obtain better outcomes if they added nurses to reduce their patient:nurse ratios.\n* Increasingly, nonphysician providers are playing innovative roles in the ICU, and care provided by teams including nurse practitioners or physician assistants appears to be safe and comparable to that provided by other staffing models.\n* The conditions of ICU staffing will continue to change under the stresses of shortages of a variety of health care workers relevant to ICU care, and increasing duty hour limitations for physician trainees. Nonphysician providers, innovative staffing models, telemedicine, and other technologies will be increasingly used to cope with these realities.\n* Since only quantitative evaluation can tell us whether one staffing model is better than another, we need more research from multiple sites to develop a consistent and integrated understanding of this complex topic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Critical Care, 4e|last=Garland|first=A|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Specialities==\n[[File:ICU1a.jpg|thumb|ICU Nurse attending to a patient in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n[[File:US Navy 030423-N-6967M-090 A central computer system monitors the heart rates of each patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to ensure a quick.jpg|thumb|ICU nurses monitoring patients from a central computer station. This allows for rapid intervention should a patient's condition deteriorate whilst a member of staff is not immediately at the bedside.]]\n[[File:Sick baby with nurses.jpg|thumb|Nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)]]\nHospitals may have ICUs that cater to a specific medical requirement or patient, such as those listed below:\n* [[Neonatal intensive care unit]] ('''NICU'''). This specialty unit cares for neonatal patients who have not left the hospital after birth. Common conditions cared for include prematurity and associated complications, congenital disorders such as [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]], or complications resulting from the birthing process. \n* [[Pediatric intensive care unit]] ('''PICU'''). Pediatric patients are treated in this intensive care unit for life-threatening conditions such as asthma, influenza, diabetic ketoacidosis, or traumatic neurological injury. Surgical cases may also be referred to the PICU postoperatively if the patient has a potential for rapid deterioration or if the patient requires monitoring, such as spinal infusions or surgeries involving the respiratory system such as removal of the tonsils or adenoids. Some facilities also have specialized pediatric cardiac intensive care units, for patients with congenital heart disease are treated. These units also typically cater for cardiac transplantation and postoperative cardiac catheterization patients if those services are offered at the hospital.  \n* [[Geriatric intensive-care unit]] ('''GICU'''), a special intensive care unit dedicated to management of critically ill elderly. \n* [[Psychiatric intensive care unit]] ('''PsICU'''). Patients who may voluntarily harm themselves are brought here for more vigorous monitoring. \n* [[Coronary care unit]] ('''CCU'''): Also known as Cardiac Intensive Care Units (CICU) or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), this ICU caters to patients specifically with [[congenital heart defects]] or life-threatening cardiac conditions such as a [[myocardial infarction]] or a [[cardiac arrest]].\n* Neurological Intensive Care Unit ('''NeuroICU'''). Patients are treated for brain aneurysms, brain tumors, stroke, rattlesnake bites and post surgical patients who have undergone various neurological surgeries performed by experienced [[neurosurgeon]]s  require constant neurological exams. Nurses who work within these units have neurological certifications. Once the patients are stable and removed from the ventilator, they are transferred to a neurological care unit. \n* Traumatic Intensive Care Unit ('''TICU'''). These are found in hospitals certified in treating traumatic injuries/illnesses requiring a dedicated Trauma Emergency team equipped with the expertise to deal with serious complications. A traumatic specialist team includes surgeons, nurses, respiratory therapists, and radiological staff.\n* [[Post-anesthesia care unit]] ('''PACU'''): Also known as the post-operative recovery unit, or recovery room, the PACU provides immediate post-op observation and stabilisation of patients following surgical operations and anesthesia. Patients are usually held in such facilities for a limited amount of time and have to meet set [[physiological]] aspects before being transferred back to a ward with a qualified nurse escort. Owing to high patient flow in recovery units, and to the [[bed management]] cycle, if a patient breaches a time frame and is too unstable to be transferred back to a ward, they are normally transferred to a high dependency unit (HDU) or post-operative critical care unit (POCCU) in order to receive progressive treatment.\n* High dependency unit ('''HDU'''): In the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere (known as step down unit or progressive care unit in North America), most acute hospitals have a transitional high dependency unit (HDU) for patients who require close observation, treatment and nursing care that cannot be provided in a general ward, but whose care is not at a critical stage to warrant an ('''ICU''') bed. These units are also called step-down or progressive intensive recovery units and are utilised until a patient's condition stabilizes to qualify for discharge to a general ward or recovery unit.<ref>{{citation | title = Intensive Care Patients Experiences: High Dependency Units | url = http://www.healthtalkonline.org/intensive_care/Intensive_care_Patients_experiences/Topic/1217/ | work = healthtalkonline.org | publisher = [[DIPEx Charity|DIPEx]] | location = Oxford, England | date = November 2012 | format = compiled patient testimonials}}</ref>\n* [[Surgical intensive care unit]] ('''SICU'''): Also known as the surgery critical care unit, the SICU is a specialized service in larger hospitals that provides inpatient care for critically ill patients on surgical services.  As opposed to other ICUs, the care is managed by surgeons or anesthesiologists trained in critical-care.\n\n=== Mobile ICU ===\n[[File:MICU UZA Nationaal Defil\u00e9 2018.jpg|thumb|MICU of the university hospital in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]]]\n*Mobile intensive care unit ('''MICU''')\n\nA specialized [[ambulance]] with the team and equipment to provide on-scene Advanced Life Support and intensive care during transportation. These type of ICUs are generally used for people who are being transferred from hospitals and from home to a hospital. In the Anglo American model of pre-hospitalisation care MICUs are generally crewed by ('''ECT practitioners''') or advanced life support paramedics.  In the European model, Mobile ICU teams are usually managed by a critical care nurse and an emergency medicine physician/medical doctor (M.D).\n\n==Equipment and systems==\nCommon equipment in an ICU includes [[mechanical ventilator]]s to assist breathing through an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] or a [[tracheostomy tube]]; cardiac monitors for monitoring Cardiac condition; equipment for the constant [[medical monitors|monitoring]] of bodily functions; a web of [[intravenous fluids|intravenous lines]], feeding tubes, [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tubes]], suction pumps, drains, and [[catheters]], syringe pumps; and a wide array of [[pharmacology|drugs]] to treat the primary condition(s) of hospitalization. [[induced coma|Medically induced comas]], [[analgesic]]s, and [[sedation|induced sedation]] are common ICU tools needed and used to reduce [[pain]] and prevent [[secondary infection]]s.\n\n==Quality of care==\nThe available data suggests a relation between ICU volume and quality of care for mechanically ventilated patients.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kahn | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Goss | first2 = C.H. | last3 = Heagerty | first3= P.J. | last4 =  Kramer | first4 = A.A. | last5 = O'Brien | first5 = C.R. | last6 = Rubenfeld | first6 = G.D. |displayauthors=4 | title = Hospital volume and the outcomes of mechanical ventilation | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 355 | issue = 1 | pages = 41\u201350 | date = 2006-07-06 | pmid = 16822995 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsa053993}}</ref> After adjustment for severity of illnesses, [[demography|demographic]] variables, and characteristics of different ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU staffing was significantly associated with lower ICU and hospital [[mortality rate]]s. A ratio of 2 patients to 1 nurse is recommended for a medical ICU, which contrasts to the ratio of 4:1 or 5:1 typically seen on medical floors. This varies from country to country, though; e.g., in Australasia and the United Kingdom, most ICUs are staffed on a 2:1 basis (for high-dependency patients who require closer monitoring or more intensive treatment than a hospital ward can offer) or on a 1:1 basis for patients requiring extreme intensive support and monitoring; for example, a patient on a mechanical ventilator with associated anaesthetics or sedation such as [[propofol]], [[midazolam]] and use of strong analgesics such as [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]] and/or [[remifentanil]].\n\nInternational guidelines recommend that every patient gets checked for delirium every day (usually twice or as much required) using a validated clinical tool. The two most widely used are the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). There are translations of these tools in over 20 languages and they are used globally in many ICU's.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ely|first1=EW|display-authors=etal|title=Delirium in mechanically ventilated patients: validity and reliability of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU).|journal=JAMA|date=2001-12-05|volume=286|issue=21|pages=2703\u201310|pmid=11730446|doi=10.1001/jama.286.21.2703|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Operational logistics==\nIn the United States, up to 20% of hospital beds can be labelled as intensive-care beds; in the United Kingdom, intensive care usually will comprise only up to 2% of total beds.

This is variously called an '''eICU''', '''virtual ICU''', or '''tele-ICU'''.  Remote staff typically have access to vital signs from live monitoring systems, and telectronic health records so they may have access to a broader view of a patient's medical history. Often bedside and remote staff have met in person and may rotate responsibilities.  Such systems are beneficial to intensive care units in order to ensure correct procedures are being followed for patients vulnerable to deterioration, to access vital signs remotely in order to keep patients that would have to be transferred to a larger facility if need be he/she may have demonstrated a significant decrease in stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfae.org/post/hospitals-monitor-icu-patients-virtually-many-miles-away |title=Hospitals Monitor ICU Patients Virtually, From Many Miles Away |publisher=WFAE |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://perspectives.ahima.org/tele-icu-efficacy-and-cost-effectiveness-of-remotely-managing-critical-care/#.Vzo3vJ6j7eQ |title=Tele-ICU: Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of Remotely Managing Critical Care &#124; Perspectives |website=Perspectives.ahima.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.chcf.org/publications/2014/01/teleicu-care |title=Emerging Best Practices for Tele-ICU Care |website=CHCF.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A Second Set of Eyes: An Introduction to Tele-ICU|first=Susan F.|last=Goran|date=1 August 2010|journal=Crit Care Nurse|volume=30|issue=4|pages=46\u201355|doi=10.4037/ccn2010283|pmid=20675821}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ICU quality and management tools]]\n* [[Intensive Care Foundation]], a charity in Australia and New Zealand\n* [[Intensive Care Medicine (journal)|''Intensive Care Medicine'' (journal)]]\n* [[Open-source ventilator]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite Q|Q29581786}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Intensive-care units}}\n*{{cite web |title= Intensive Care |work= NHS choices |publisher= [[National Health Service]] |location= UK |url= http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Intensive-care/Pages/Introduction.aspx|date= 2017-10-18 }}\n*{{cite web |title= Critical Care |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/criticalcare.html |publisher= [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]], [[National Institutes of Health]] |work= [[MedlinePlus]] |location= US}}\n* [http://www.sccm.org Society of Critical Care Medicine]\n* [http://www.icusteps.org ICUsteps \u2013 Intensive care patient support charity]\n* [http://www.vibha.info Organisation for Critical Care Transportation]\n* {{cite journal |first1=H.N. |last1= Reynolds |first2= H.|last2= Rogove |first3= J. |last3= Bander |first4= M. |last4= McCambridge |first5= E. |last5= Cowboy |first6= M. |last6= Niemeier |displayauthors=4 |journal= Telemedicine and E-Health. |date= December 2011 |volume= 17|issue= 10 |pages= 773\u2013783 |doi=10.1089/tmj.2011.0045 |pmid= 22029748 |title= A working lexicon for the tele-intensive care unit: We need to define tele-intensive care unit to grow and understand it|hdl= 2027.42/90470 |url= https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/90470/1/tmj-2E2011-2E0045.pdf }}\n* {{cite journal |first1=Terrah J.

ICUs are also distinguished from general hospital wards by a higher staff-to-patient ratio and to access to advanced medical resources and equipment that is not routinely available elsewhere. Common conditions that are treated within ICUs include acute (or adult) respiratory distress syndrome, hypertension, metastases and other life-threatening conditions.\n\nPatients may be referred directly from an [[emergency department]] or from a ward if they rapidly deteriorate, or immediately after surgery if the surgery is very invasive and the patient is at high risk of complications.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-icu.htm | title = What is an ICU | website = wiseGEEK | publisher = Conjecture Corporation | location = Sparks, Nevada | last = Smith | first = S.

Although this was not the case, her experiences during the war formed the foundation for her later discovery of the importance of sanitary conditions in hospitals, a critical component of intensive care.\n\nIn 1950, [[anesthesiologist]] [[Peter Safar]] established the concept of \"Advanced life support\", keeping [[patient]]s sedated and ventilated in an intensive care environment. Safar is considered to be the first practitioner of intensive care medicine as a speciality.\n\nIn response to a [[polio]] [[epidemic]] (where many patients required constant ventilation and surveillance), [[Bj\u00f8rn Aage Ibsen]] established the first intensive care unit in [[Copenhagen]] in 1953.<ref>{{citation | title = Der d\u00e4nische An\u00e4sthesist Bj\u00f6rn Ibsen ein Pionier der Langzeitbeatmung \u00fcber die oberen Luftwege | last = Reisner-S\u00e9n\u00e9lar | first = L. | work = Doctoral Thesis | year = 2009 | location = Frankfurt am Main, Germany | language = German | oclc = 600186486 | publisher = Johann Wolfgang Goethe University | url = http://d-nb.info/999147323/34}}.

This subject is complicated by the fact that optimal ICU staffing may depend on ICU characteristics.\n* Despite calls for all ICUs to function as closed-model units with intensivists as the primary physician of record, evidence supporting this view is contradictory. Likewise, studies of around-the-clock intensivist presence have not consistently shown that it is associated with superior outcomes.\n* The data do not supply a consistent answer to the question of whether ICUs would obtain better outcomes if they added nurses to reduce their patient:nurse ratios.\n* Increasingly, nonphysician providers are playing innovative roles in the ICU, and care provided by teams including nurse practitioners or physician assistants appears to be safe and comparable to that provided by other staffing models.\n* The conditions of ICU staffing will continue to change under the stresses of shortages of a variety of health care workers relevant to ICU care, and increasing duty hour limitations for physician trainees. Nonphysician providers, innovative staffing models, telemedicine, and other technologies will be increasingly used to cope with these realities.\n* Since only quantitative evaluation can tell us whether one staffing model is better than another, we need more research from multiple sites to develop a consistent and integrated understanding of this complex topic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Critical Care, 4e|last=Garland|first=A|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Specialities==\n[[File:ICU1a.jpg|thumb|ICU Nurse attending to a patient in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n[[File:US Navy 030423-N-6967M-090 A central computer system monitors the heart rates of each patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to ensure a quick.jpg|thumb|ICU nurses monitoring patients from a central computer station. This allows for rapid intervention should a patient's condition deteriorate whilst a member of staff is not immediately at the bedside.]]\n[[File:Sick baby with nurses.jpg|thumb|Nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)]]\nHospitals may have ICUs that cater to a specific medical requirement or patient, such as those listed below:\n* [[Neonatal intensive care unit]] ('''NICU'''). This specialty unit cares for neonatal patients who have not left the hospital after birth. Common conditions cared for include prematurity and associated complications, congenital disorders such as [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]], or complications resulting from the birthing process. \n* [[Pediatric intensive care unit]] ('''PICU'''). Pediatric patients are treated in this intensive care unit for life-threatening conditions such as asthma, influenza, diabetic ketoacidosis, or traumatic neurological injury. Surgical cases may also be referred to the PICU postoperatively if the patient has a potential for rapid deterioration or if the patient requires monitoring, such as spinal infusions or surgeries involving the respiratory system such as removal of the tonsils or adenoids. Some facilities also have specialized pediatric cardiac intensive care units, for patients with congenital heart disease are treated. These units also typically cater for cardiac transplantation and postoperative cardiac catheterization patients if those services are offered at the hospital.  \n* [[Geriatric intensive-care unit]] ('''GICU'''), a special intensive care unit dedicated to management of critically ill elderly. \n* [[Psychiatric intensive care unit]] ('''PsICU'''). Patients who may voluntarily harm themselves are brought here for more vigorous monitoring. \n* [[Coronary care unit]] ('''CCU'''): Also known as Cardiac Intensive Care Units (CICU) or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), this ICU caters to patients specifically with [[congenital heart defects]] or life-threatening cardiac conditions such as a [[myocardial infarction]] or a [[cardiac arrest]].\n* Neurological Intensive Care Unit ('''NeuroICU'''). Patients are treated for brain aneurysms, brain tumors, stroke, rattlesnake bites and post surgical patients who have undergone various neurological surgeries performed by experienced [[neurosurgeon]]s  require constant neurological exams. Nurses who work within these units have neurological certifications. Once the patients are stable and removed from the ventilator, they are transferred to a neurological care unit. \n* Traumatic Intensive Care Unit ('''TICU'''). These are found in hospitals certified in treating traumatic injuries/illnesses requiring a dedicated Trauma Emergency team equipped with the expertise to deal with serious complications. A traumatic specialist team includes surgeons, nurses, respiratory therapists, and radiological staff.\n* [[Post-anesthesia care unit]] ('''PACU'''): Also known as the post-operative recovery unit, or recovery room, the PACU provides immediate post-op observation and stabilisation of patients following surgical operations and anesthesia. Patients are usually held in such facilities for a limited amount of time and have to meet set [[physiological]] aspects before being transferred back to a ward with a qualified nurse escort. Owing to high patient flow in recovery units, and to the [[bed management]] cycle, if a patient breaches a time frame and is too unstable to be transferred back to a ward, they are normally transferred to a high dependency unit (HDU) or post-operative critical care unit (POCCU) in order to receive progressive treatment.\n* High dependency unit ('''HDU'''): In the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere (known as step down unit or progressive care unit in North America), most acute hospitals have a transitional high dependency unit (HDU) for patients who require close observation, treatment and nursing care that cannot be provided in a general ward, but whose care is not at a critical stage to warrant an ('''ICU''') bed. These units are also called step-down or progressive intensive recovery units and are utilised until a patient's condition stabilizes to qualify for discharge to a general ward or recovery unit.<ref>{{citation | title = Intensive Care Patients Experiences: High Dependency Units | url = http://www.healthtalkonline.org/intensive_care/Intensive_care_Patients_experiences/Topic/1217/ | work = healthtalkonline.org | publisher = [[DIPEx Charity|DIPEx]] | location = Oxford, England | date = November 2012 | format = compiled patient testimonials}}</ref>\n* [[Surgical intensive care unit]] ('''SICU'''): Also known as the surgery critical care unit, the SICU is a specialized service in larger hospitals that provides inpatient care for critically ill patients on surgical services.  As opposed to other ICUs, the care is managed by surgeons or anesthesiologists trained in critical-care.\n\n=== Mobile ICU ===\n[[File:MICU UZA Nationaal Defil\u00e9 2018.jpg|thumb|MICU of the university hospital in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]]]\n*Mobile intensive care unit ('''MICU''')\n\nA specialized [[ambulance]] with the team and equipment to provide on-scene Advanced Life Support and intensive care during transportation. These type of ICUs are generally used for people who are being transferred from hospitals and from home to a hospital. In the Anglo American model of pre-hospitalisation care MICUs are generally crewed by ('''ECT practitioners''') or advanced life support paramedics.  In the European model, Mobile ICU teams are usually managed by a critical care nurse and an emergency medicine physician/medical doctor (M.D).\n\n==Equipment and systems==\nCommon equipment in an ICU includes [[mechanical ventilator]]s to assist breathing through an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] or a [[tracheostomy tube]]; cardiac monitors for monitoring Cardiac condition; equipment for the constant [[medical monitors|monitoring]] of bodily functions; a web of [[intravenous fluids|intravenous lines]], feeding tubes, [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tubes]], suction pumps, drains, and [[catheters]], syringe pumps; and a wide array of [[pharmacology|drugs]] to treat the primary condition(s) of hospitalization. [[induced coma|Medically induced comas]], [[analgesic]]s, and [[sedation|induced sedation]] are common ICU tools needed and used to reduce [[pain]] and prevent [[secondary infection]]s.\n\n==Quality of care==\nThe available data suggests a relation between ICU volume and quality of care for mechanically ventilated patients.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kahn | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Goss | first2 = C.H. | last3 = Heagerty | first3= P.J. | last4 =  Kramer | first4 = A.A. | last5 = O'Brien | first5 = C.R. | last6 = Rubenfeld | first6 = G.D. |displayauthors=4 | title = Hospital volume and the outcomes of mechanical ventilation | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 355 | issue = 1 | pages = 41\u201350 | date = 2006-07-06 | pmid = 16822995 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsa053993}}</ref> After adjustment for severity of illnesses, [[demography|demographic]] variables, and characteristics of different ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU staffing was significantly associated with lower ICU and hospital [[mortality rate]]s. A ratio of 2 patients to 1 nurse is recommended for a medical ICU, which contrasts to the ratio of 4:1 or 5:1 typically seen on medical floors. This varies from country to country, though; e.g., in Australasia and the United Kingdom, most ICUs are staffed on a 2:1 basis (for high-dependency patients who require closer monitoring or more intensive treatment than a hospital ward can offer) or on a 1:1 basis for patients requiring extreme intensive support and monitoring; for example, a patient on a mechanical ventilator with associated anaesthetics or sedation such as [[propofol]], [[midazolam]] and use of strong analgesics such as [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]] and/or [[remifentanil]].\n\nInternational guidelines recommend that every patient gets checked for delirium every day (usually twice or as much required) using a validated clinical tool. The two most widely used are the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). There are translations of these tools in over 20 languages and they are used globally in many ICU's.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ely|first1=EW|display-authors=etal|title=Delirium in mechanically ventilated patients: validity and reliability of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU).|journal=JAMA|date=2001-12-05|volume=286|issue=21|pages=2703\u201310|pmid=11730446|doi=10.1001/jama.286.21.2703|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Operational logistics==\nIn the United States, up to 20% of hospital beds can be labelled as intensive-care beds; in the United Kingdom, intensive care usually will comprise only up to 2% of total beds.

This is variously called an '''eICU''', '''virtual ICU''', or '''tele-ICU'''.  Remote staff typically have access to vital signs from live monitoring systems, and telectronic health records so they may have access to a broader view of a patient's medical history. Often bedside and remote staff have met in person and may rotate responsibilities.  Such systems are beneficial to intensive care units in order to ensure correct procedures are being followed for patients vulnerable to deterioration, to access vital signs remotely in order to keep patients that would have to be transferred to a larger facility if need be he/she may have demonstrated a significant decrease in stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfae.org/post/hospitals-monitor-icu-patients-virtually-many-miles-away |title=Hospitals Monitor ICU Patients Virtually, From Many Miles Away |publisher=WFAE |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://perspectives.ahima.org/tele-icu-efficacy-and-cost-effectiveness-of-remotely-managing-critical-care/#.Vzo3vJ6j7eQ |title=Tele-ICU: Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of Remotely Managing Critical Care &#124; Perspectives |website=Perspectives.ahima.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.chcf.org/publications/2014/01/teleicu-care |title=Emerging Best Practices for Tele-ICU Care |website=CHCF.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A Second Set of Eyes: An Introduction to Tele-ICU|first=Susan F.|last=Goran|date=1 August 2010|journal=Crit Care Nurse|volume=30|issue=4|pages=46\u201355|doi=10.4037/ccn2010283|pmid=20675821}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ICU quality and management tools]]\n* [[Intensive Care Foundation]], a charity in Australia and New Zealand\n* [[Intensive Care Medicine (journal)|''Intensive Care Medicine'' (journal)]]\n* [[Open-source ventilator]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite Q|Q29581786}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Intensive-care units}}\n*{{cite web |title= Intensive Care |work= NHS choices |publisher= [[National Health Service]] |location= UK |url= http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Intensive-care/Pages/Introduction.aspx|date= 2017-10-18 }}\n*{{cite web |title= Critical Care |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/criticalcare.html |publisher= [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]], [[National Institutes of Health]] |work= [[MedlinePlus]] |location= US}}\n* [http://www.sccm.org Society of Critical Care Medicine]\n* [http://www.icusteps.org ICUsteps \u2013 Intensive care patient support charity]\n* [http://www.vibha.info Organisation for Critical Care Transportation]\n* {{cite journal |first1=H.N. |last1= Reynolds |first2= H.|last2= Rogove |first3= J. |last3= Bander |first4= M. |last4= McCambridge |first5= E. |last5= Cowboy |first6= M. |last6= Niemeier |displayauthors=4 |journal= Telemedicine and E-Health. |date= December 2011 |volume= 17|issue= 10 |pages= 773\u2013783 |doi=10.1089/tmj.2011.0045 |pmid= 22029748 |title= A working lexicon for the tele-intensive care unit: We need to define tele-intensive care unit to grow and understand it|hdl= 2027.42/90470 |url= https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/90470/1/tmj-2E2011-2E0045.pdf }}\n* {{cite journal |first1=Terrah J.

The city's wealth supported the development of art during the [[Italian Renaissance]], and tourism attracted by its rich history continues today.\n\n==Prehistoric origins==\nFor much of the [[Quaternary]] Age, the Florence-[[Prato]]-[[Pistoia]] plain was occupied by a great lake bounded by [[Monte Cavo|Monte Albano]] in the west, [[Montegiovi|Monte Giovi]] in the north and the foothills of [[Chianti]] in the south. Even after most of the water had receded, the plain, {{convert|50|m}} above sea level, was strewn with ponds and marshes that remained until the 18th century, when the land was reclaimed. Most of the marshland was in the region of [[Campi Bisenzio]], [[Signa]] and [[Bagno a Ripoli]].\n\nIt is thought that there was already a settlement at the confluence of the Mugnone River with the [[River Arno]] between the 10th and 8th centuries [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Between the 7th and 6th centuries BC, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] discovered and used the ford of the Arno near this confluence, closer to the hills to the north and south. A bridge or a ferry was probably constructed here, about ten metres away from the current [[Ponte Vecchio]], but closer to the ford itself. The Etruscans, however, preferred not to build cities on the plain for reasons of defence and instead settled about six kilometres away on a hill. This settlement was a precursor of the fortified centre of Vipsul (today's [[Fiesole]]), which was later connected by road to all the major Etruscan centres of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] to the north and [[Lazio]] to the south.\n\n==Early Middle Ages==\nThe seat of a [[diocese|bishopric]] from around the beginning of the 4th century [[Anno Domini|CE]], the city was ruled alternatively by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ostrogothic]] potentates as the two powers fought each other for control of the city.  The city would be taken by siege only to be lost again later by one of the two powers.\n\nPeace returned under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule in the 6th century. Conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774, Florence became part of the [[March of Tuscany]], whose capital was [[Lucca]]. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and [[Fiesole]] were united in one county.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Republic of Florence}}\n\n[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Profile of [[Dante Alighieri]], one of the most renowned Italian poets, painted by his contemporary [[Giotto di Bondone]]]]\n[[Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Hugh \"the Great\" of Tuscany]] chose Florence as his residence instead of Lucca in about 1000&nbsp;CE. This initiated a [[Golden Age]] of [[Florentine Art]]. In 1013, construction was begun on the [[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte]]. The exterior of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|baptistry]] was reworked in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style between 1059 and 1128.\n\nFlorence experienced a long period of civic revival beginning in the 10th century and was governed from 1115 by an autonomous [[medieval commune]]. But the period of revival was interrupted when the city was plunged into internal strife by the 13th-century struggle between the [[Ghibellines]], supporters of the [[Holy Roman Emperor|German emperor]], and the pro-[[Papacy|Papal]] [[Guelphs]] after the murder of nobleman Buondelmonte del Buondelmonti for reneging on his agreement to marry one of the daughters of the [[Amidei]] family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/hsteu401/Buondelmonte.htm|title=13th C|work=washington.edu}}</ref> In 1257, the city was ruled by a ''[[podest\u00e0]]'', the Guelph [[Luca Grimaldi]]. The Guelphs had triumphed and soon split in turn into feuding \"White\" and \"Black\" factions led respectively by [[Vieri de' Cerchi]] and [[Corso Donati]]. These struggles eventually led to the exile of the White Guelphs, one of whom was the poet [[Dante Alighieri]]. This factional strife was later recorded by [[Dino Compagni]], a White Guelph, in his ''Chronicles of Florence''.\n\n[[File:Growth of the Florentine State.png|thumb|right|250px|The growth of Florence from 1300 to 1500]]\nPolitical conflict did not, however, prevent the city's rise to become one of the most powerful and prosperous in Europe, assisted by its own strong gold currency. The \"fiorino d'oro\" of the [[Republic of Florence]], or [[Italian coin florin|florin]], was introduced in 1252, the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities to play a significant commercial role since the 7th century. Many Florentine banks had branches across Europe, with able bankers and merchants such as the famous chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]] of the [[Peruzzi|Peruzzi Company]] engaging in commercial transactions as far away as [[Bruges]]. The florin quickly became the dominant trade coin of Western Europe, replacing silver bars in multiples of the mark. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival [[Pisa]], which was defeated by [[Genoa]] in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206021644/http://www.florence-italy-guide.com|title=First impressive impressions of florence in Italy|date=6 February 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>. Power shifted from the aristocracy to the mercantile elite and members of organized [[guild]]s after an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, enacted the [[Ordinances of Justice]] in 1293.\n\nWhile visiting the ruins of Rome during the [[Jubilee (Christian)|jubilee]] celebration in 1300, the banker and chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]] (c. 1276\u20131348) noted the well-known history of the city, its monuments and achievements, and was then inspired to write a [[universal history]] of his own city of Florence. Hence he began to record the history of Florence in a year-by-year format in his ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'', which was continued by his brother and nephew after he succumbed to the [[Black Death]] in 1348. Villani is praised by historians for preserving valuable information on statistics, biographies, and even events taking place throughout Europe, but his work has also drawn criticism by historians for its many inaccuracies, use of the supernatural and [[divine providence]] to explain the outcome of events and glorification of Florence and the [[papacy]].\n\n[[File:Europa06 211.jpg|left|thumb|A rare snow-covered Florence, with the towering ''[[campanile]]'' of the [[Cathedral of Florence]] to the right]]\n\n==Renaissance==\nIn 1338, there were about 17,000 beggars in the city. 4,000 were on public relief. There were six primary schools with 10,000 pupils, including girls. Four high schools taught 600 students, including a few girls. They studied literature and philosophy.<ref name=durant/>.\n\nOf a population estimated at 80,000 before the [[Black Death]] of 1349, about 25,000 are estimated to have been engaged in the city's wool industry. In 1345, Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool carders (''ciompi''), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule known as the [[Revolt of the Ciompi]]. After their suppression, the city came under the sway of the [[Albizzi]] family, bitter rivals of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]], between 1382 and 1434.  [[Cosimo de' Medici]] (1389\u20131464) was the first Medici family member to govern the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast network of [[patronage]] and a political alliance to new immigrants to the city, the ''gente nuova''. The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their prominence. Cosimo was succeeded by his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici]] (1416\u20131469), who was shortly thereafter succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] in 1469. Lorenzo de' Medici was a great patron of the arts who commissioned works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Sandro Botticelli]].\n\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - FLORENCIA.png|thumb|250px|Florence in a 1493 woodcut from [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\nAfter Lorenzo's death in 1492, his son [[Piero the Unfortunate]] took the reins of government, however his rule was short. In 1494, King  [[Charles VIII of France]] invaded Italy and entered Tuscany on his way to claim the throne of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. After Piero made a submissive treaty with Charles, the Florentines responded by forcing him into exile, and the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government. Anti-Medici sentiment was much influenced by the teachings of the radical Dominican prior [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. However, in due time, Savonarola lost support and was hanged in 1498.  Medici rule was not restored until 1512. The Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established the [[Republic of Florence|Republic]] on May 16, 1527.\n\nAn individual of highly unusual insight into political conditions of this time was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimization of political expediency and even evil. Machiavelli was tortured and exiled from Florence by the Medici family in 1513, due accusations of conspiracy, which was exacerbated because of his ties to the previous republican government of Florence. Commissioned by the Medici, in 1520 Machiavelli wrote the ''[[Florentine Histories]]'', a history of the city.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2kiYz6d278IC&lpg=PP1&dq=quentin%20skinner%20machiavelli&pg=PT36#v=onepage&q&f=false Machiavelli: A Very Short Introduction By Quentin Skinner] </ref>\n\n[[File:Siege of Florence1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Siege of Florence (1529\u201330)|Siege of Florence]] in 1530]]\nThe 10-month [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)]]  by the Spanish ended the [[Republic of Florence]] and [[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence|Alessandro de' Medici]] became the ruler of the city.

In 1569, Duke [[Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] was elevated to the rank of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] by [[Pope Pius V]]. The Medici would continue to rule in Tuscany as grand dukes until 1737. After the [[Battle of Marciano]] in 1554, the city's historical rival [[Siena]] was conquered and the only remaining territory in Tuscany not ruled from Florence was the Republic of [[Lucca]] (later a [[Duchy of Lucca|Duchy]]).\n\nDuring [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] Florence, [[Crowd|mob]]s were both common and influential. Families were pitted against each other in a constant struggle for power. Politically, double-crossings and betrayals were not uncommon, sometimes even within families. Despite political violence, factionalism and corruption, Renaissance Florence did experiment with different forms of citizen government and power sharing arrangements. In order to reconcile the warring factions and families, a complex electoral system was developed as mechanism for sharing power.<ref>Oliver Dowlen, ''Sorted: Civic Lotteries and the Future of Public Participation,'' (MASS LBP: Toronto, 2008) pp 36</ref> Incumbent officers and appointees carried out a secret ballot every three or four years. They committed the names of all those elected into a series of bags, one for each sesto, or sixth, of the city. One name was drawn from each bag every two months to form the highest executive authority of the city, the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]]. The selection scheme was controlled to ensure that no two members of the same family ended up in the same batch of six names.\n\nThis [[Sortition|lottery]] arrangement organized the political structure of Florence until 1434, when the Medici family took power. To maintain control, the Medici undermined the selection process by introducing a system of elected committees they could effectively manipulate by fear and favour. Civic lotteries still took place, but actual power rested with the Medicis. In 1465, a movement to reintroduce civic lotteries was halted by an extraordinary commission packed with Medici supporters.<ref>Dowlen, ''Sorted''</ref>\n\n===Role in art, literature, music and science===\n<!---sentences in these paragraphs seem accurate enough but are way too long. Run-on--->\nThe surge in artistic, literary, and scientific investigation that occurred in Florence in the 14th-16th centuries was facilitated by Florentines' strong economy, based on money, banking, trade, and with [[conspicuous consumption|the display of wealth and leisure]].\n\nIn parallel with leisure evolving from a strong economy, the crises of the [[Catholic]] church (especially the controversy over the French [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]) along with the catastrophic effects of the [[Black Death]] led to a re-evaluation of medieval values, resulting in the development of a [[Humanism|humanist]] culture, stimulated by the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]. This prompted a revisitation and study of the [[classical antiquity]], leading to the [[Renaissance]].<ref>[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}</ref> \n\nThis renaissance thrived locally from about 1434 to 1534.

In the arts, the creations of Florentine artists, architects, and musicians were influential in many parts of Europe. The culmination of certain speculations into the nature of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] by humanist scholars led to the birth of [[opera]] in the 1590s.\n\n==Modern and contemporary age==\n[[File:Johann Zoffany 005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The family of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]], the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1790.]]\nThe extinction of the Medici line and the accession in 1737 of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine]], the husband of [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria, led to Tuscany's inclusion in the territories of the [[Austria]]n crown. Austrian rule was to end in defeat at the hands of France and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]-Piedmont in 1859, and Tuscany became a province of the united [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861.\n\n[[File:Oswald Achenbach 003.jpg|thumb|250px|Florence in 1898, a painting by [[Oswald Achenbach]].]]\nFlorence replaced [[Turin]] as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emmanuele II]], then [[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]], the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Poet [[Antonio Pucci (poet)|Antonio Pucci]] had written in the 14th century, \"There was never so noble a garden as when in Mercato Vecchio the eyes and tastes of the Florentines did feast.\" The area had, however, decayed from its original medieval splendor. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today. The country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later after the withdrawal of the French troops made its addition to the kingdom possible. A very important role is played in these years by the famous Florentine caf\u00e9 [[Caff\u00e8 Giubbe Rosse|Giubbe Rosse]] from its foundation until the present day.\n\n==20th century==\nIn the 19th century, the population of Florence doubled to over 230,000, and in the 20th century reached over 450,000 at one point with the growth of tourism, trade, financial services and the industry. A foreign community came to represent one-quarter of the population in the second half of the 19th century and of this period and writers such as [[James Irving (writer)|James Irving]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|pre-Raphaelite artists]] captured a romantic vision of the city in their works. Numerous villas of mainly English barons with their eclectic collections of art were bequeathed to the city in this era. Today they are occupied by museums such as the [[Horne Museum]], the [[Stibbert Museum]], [[Villa La Pietra]], etc.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943\u20131944). On September 25, 1943, Allied bombers targeted central Florence, destroying many buildings and killed 215 civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoomedia.it/Firenze/storia/1900/liberazione/25settembre/index.html|title=25 settembre 1943 bombardamento di Firenze - Zoomedia.it|work=zoomedia.it}}</ref>\n[[File:The Ponte Vecchio bridge in Florence, damaged by the retreating Germans who blew up buildings at each, 14 August 1944.

On 4 August, the retreating Germans decided to detonate charges along the bridges of the Arno linking the district of [[Oltrarno]] to the rest of the city, thus making it difficult for the New Zealand, South African and British troops to cross just before liberation. The German officer in charge of the demolitions, [[Gerhard Wolf]], ordered that the [[Ponte Vecchio]] was to be spared. Before the war, Wolf had been a student in the city, and his decision has been honored with a memorial plaque on the bridge.

The city's wealth supported the development of art during the [[Italian Renaissance]], and tourism attracted by its rich history continues today.\n\n==Prehistoric origins==\nFor much of the [[Quaternary]] Age, the Florence-[[Prato]]-[[Pistoia]] plain was occupied by a great lake bounded by [[Monte Cavo|Monte Albano]] in the west, [[Montegiovi|Monte Giovi]] in the north and the foothills of [[Chianti]] in the south. Even after most of the water had receded, the plain, {{convert|50|m}} above sea level, was strewn with ponds and marshes that remained until the 18th century, when the land was reclaimed. Most of the marshland was in the region of [[Campi Bisenzio]], [[Signa]] and [[Bagno a Ripoli]].\n\nIt is thought that there was already a settlement at the confluence of the Mugnone River with the [[River Arno]] between the 10th and 8th centuries [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Between the 7th and 6th centuries BC, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] discovered and used the ford of the Arno near this confluence, closer to the hills to the north and south. A bridge or a ferry was probably constructed here, about ten metres away from the current [[Ponte Vecchio]], but closer to the ford itself. The Etruscans, however, preferred not to build cities on the plain for reasons of defence and instead settled about six kilometres away on a hill. This settlement was a precursor of the fortified centre of Vipsul (today's [[Fiesole]]), which was later connected by road to all the major Etruscan centres of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] to the north and [[Lazio]] to the south.\n\n==Early Middle Ages==\nThe seat of a [[diocese|bishopric]] from around the beginning of the 4th century [[Anno Domini|CE]], the city was ruled alternatively by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ostrogothic]] potentates as the two powers fought each other for control of the city.  The city would be taken by siege only to be lost again later by one of the two powers.\n\nPeace returned under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule in the 6th century. Conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774, Florence became part of the [[March of Tuscany]], whose capital was [[Lucca]]. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and [[Fiesole]] were united in one county.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Republic of Florence}}\n\n[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Profile of [[Dante Alighieri]], one of the most renowned Italian poets, painted by his contemporary [[Giotto di Bondone]]]]\n[[Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Hugh \"the Great\" of Tuscany]] chose Florence as his residence instead of Lucca in about 1000&nbsp;CE. This initiated a [[Golden Age]] of [[Florentine Art]]. In 1013, construction was begun on the [[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte]]. The exterior of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|baptistry]] was reworked in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style between 1059 and 1128.\n\nFlorence experienced a long period of civic revival beginning in the 10th century and was governed from 1115 by an autonomous [[medieval commune]]. But the period of revival was interrupted when the city was plunged into internal strife by the 13th-century struggle between the [[Ghibellines]], supporters of the [[Holy Roman Emperor|German emperor]], and the pro-[[Papacy|Papal]] [[Guelphs]] after the murder of nobleman Buondelmonte del Buondelmonti for reneging on his agreement to marry one of the daughters of the [[Amidei]] family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/hsteu401/Buondelmonte.htm|title=13th C|work=washington.edu}}</ref> In 1257, the city was ruled by a ''[[podest\u00e0]]'', the Guelph [[Luca Grimaldi]]. The Guelphs had triumphed and soon split in turn into feuding \"White\" and \"Black\" factions led respectively by [[Vieri de' Cerchi]] and [[Corso Donati]]. These struggles eventually led to the exile of the White Guelphs, one of whom was the poet [[Dante Alighieri]]. This factional strife was later recorded by [[Dino Compagni]], a White Guelph, in his ''Chronicles of Florence''.\n\n[[File:Growth of the Florentine State.png|thumb|right|250px|The growth of Florence from 1300 to 1500]]\nPolitical conflict did not, however, prevent the city's rise to become one of the most powerful and prosperous in Europe, assisted by its own strong gold currency. The \"fiorino d'oro\" of the [[Republic of Florence]], or [[Italian coin florin|florin]], was introduced in 1252, the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities to play a significant commercial role since the 7th century. Many Florentine banks had branches across Europe, with able bankers and merchants such as the famous chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]] of the [[Peruzzi|Peruzzi Company]] engaging in commercial transactions as far away as [[Bruges]]. The florin quickly became the dominant trade coin of Western Europe, replacing silver bars in multiples of the mark. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival [[Pisa]], which was defeated by [[Genoa]] in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206021644/http://www.florence-italy-guide.com|title=First impressive impressions of florence in Italy|date=6 February 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>. Power shifted from the aristocracy to the mercantile elite and members of organized [[guild]]s after an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, enacted the [[Ordinances of Justice]] in 1293.\n\nWhile visiting the ruins of Rome during the [[Jubilee (Christian)|jubilee]] celebration in 1300, the banker and chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]] (c. 1276\u20131348) noted the well-known history of the city, its monuments and achievements, and was then inspired to write a [[universal history]] of his own city of Florence. Hence he began to record the history of Florence in a year-by-year format in his ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'', which was continued by his brother and nephew after he succumbed to the [[Black Death]] in 1348. Villani is praised by historians for preserving valuable information on statistics, biographies, and even events taking place throughout Europe, but his work has also drawn criticism by historians for its many inaccuracies, use of the supernatural and [[divine providence]] to explain the outcome of events and glorification of Florence and the [[papacy]].\n\n[[File:Europa06 211.jpg|left|thumb|A rare snow-covered Florence, with the towering ''[[campanile]]'' of the [[Cathedral of Florence]] to the right]]\n\n==Renaissance==\nIn 1338, there were about 17,000 beggars in the city. 4,000 were on public relief. There were six primary schools with 10,000 pupils, including girls. Four high schools taught 600 students, including a few girls. They studied literature and philosophy.<ref name=durant/>.\n\nOf a population estimated at 80,000 before the [[Black Death]] of 1349, about 25,000 are estimated to have been engaged in the city's wool industry. In 1345, Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool carders (''ciompi''), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule known as the [[Revolt of the Ciompi]]. After their suppression, the city came under the sway of the [[Albizzi]] family, bitter rivals of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]], between 1382 and 1434.  [[Cosimo de' Medici]] (1389\u20131464) was the first Medici family member to govern the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast network of [[patronage]] and a political alliance to new immigrants to the city, the ''gente nuova''. The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their prominence. Cosimo was succeeded by his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici]] (1416\u20131469), who was shortly thereafter succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] in 1469. Lorenzo de' Medici was a great patron of the arts who commissioned works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Sandro Botticelli]].\n\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - FLORENCIA.png|thumb|250px|Florence in a 1493 woodcut from [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\nAfter Lorenzo's death in 1492, his son [[Piero the Unfortunate]] took the reins of government, however his rule was short. In 1494, King  [[Charles VIII of France]] invaded Italy and entered Tuscany on his way to claim the throne of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. After Piero made a submissive treaty with Charles, the Florentines responded by forcing him into exile, and the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government. Anti-Medici sentiment was much influenced by the teachings of the radical Dominican prior [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. However, in due time, Savonarola lost support and was hanged in 1498.  Medici rule was not restored until 1512. The Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established the [[Republic of Florence|Republic]] on May 16, 1527.\n\nAn individual of highly unusual insight into political conditions of this time was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimization of political expediency and even evil. Machiavelli was tortured and exiled from Florence by the Medici family in 1513, due accusations of conspiracy, which was exacerbated because of his ties to the previous republican government of Florence. Commissioned by the Medici, in 1520 Machiavelli wrote the ''[[Florentine Histories]]'', a history of the city.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2kiYz6d278IC&lpg=PP1&dq=quentin%20skinner%20machiavelli&pg=PT36#v=onepage&q&f=false Machiavelli: A Very Short Introduction By Quentin Skinner] </ref>\n\n[[File:Siege of Florence1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Siege of Florence (1529\u201330)|Siege of Florence]] in 1530]]\nThe 10-month [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)]]  by the Spanish ended the [[Republic of Florence]] and [[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence|Alessandro de' Medici]] became the ruler of the city.

In 1569, Duke [[Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] was elevated to the rank of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] by [[Pope Pius V]]. The Medici would continue to rule in Tuscany as grand dukes until 1737. After the [[Battle of Marciano]] in 1554, the city's historical rival [[Siena]] was conquered and the only remaining territory in Tuscany not ruled from Florence was the Republic of [[Lucca]] (later a [[Duchy of Lucca|Duchy]]).\n\nDuring [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] Florence, [[Crowd|mob]]s were both common and influential. Families were pitted against each other in a constant struggle for power. Politically, double-crossings and betrayals were not uncommon, sometimes even within families. Despite political violence, factionalism and corruption, Renaissance Florence did experiment with different forms of citizen government and power sharing arrangements. In order to reconcile the warring factions and families, a complex electoral system was developed as mechanism for sharing power.<ref>Oliver Dowlen, ''Sorted: Civic Lotteries and the Future of Public Participation,'' (MASS LBP: Toronto, 2008) pp 36</ref> Incumbent officers and appointees carried out a secret ballot every three or four years. They committed the names of all those elected into a series of bags, one for each sesto, or sixth, of the city. One name was drawn from each bag every two months to form the highest executive authority of the city, the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]]. The selection scheme was controlled to ensure that no two members of the same family ended up in the same batch of six names.\n\nThis [[Sortition|lottery]] arrangement organized the political structure of Florence until 1434, when the Medici family took power. To maintain control, the Medici undermined the selection process by introducing a system of elected committees they could effectively manipulate by fear and favour. Civic lotteries still took place, but actual power rested with the Medicis. In 1465, a movement to reintroduce civic lotteries was halted by an extraordinary commission packed with Medici supporters.<ref>Dowlen, ''Sorted''</ref>\n\n===Role in art, literature, music and science===\n<!---sentences in these paragraphs seem accurate enough but are way too long. Run-on--->\nThe surge in artistic, literary, and scientific investigation that occurred in Florence in the 14th-16th centuries was facilitated by Florentines' strong economy, based on money, banking, trade, and with [[conspicuous consumption|the display of wealth and leisure]].\n\nIn parallel with leisure evolving from a strong economy, the crises of the [[Catholic]] church (especially the controversy over the French [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]) along with the catastrophic effects of the [[Black Death]] led to a re-evaluation of medieval values, resulting in the development of a [[Humanism|humanist]] culture, stimulated by the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]. This prompted a revisitation and study of the [[classical antiquity]], leading to the [[Renaissance]].<ref>[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}</ref> \n\nThis renaissance thrived locally from about 1434 to 1534. It halted amid social, moral, and political upheaval. By then, the inspiration it had created had set the rest of Western Europe ablaze with new ideas.<ref name=durant>{{Cite book |first = Will |last = Durant |authorlink = Will Durant |title = The Story of Civilization: The Renaissance |publisher = Simon and Schuster |date = 1953 |location = New York City |isbn = 978-1567310238 }}</ref>\n\nFlorence benefited materially and culturally from this sea-change in [[social consciousness]]. In the arts, the creations of Florentine artists, architects, and musicians were influential in many parts of Europe. The culmination of certain speculations into the nature of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] by humanist scholars led to the birth of [[opera]] in the 1590s.\n\n==Modern and contemporary age==\n[[File:Johann Zoffany 005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The family of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]], the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1790.]]\nThe extinction of the Medici line and the accession in 1737 of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine]], the husband of [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria, led to Tuscany's inclusion in the territories of the [[Austria]]n crown. Austrian rule was to end in defeat at the hands of France and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]-Piedmont in 1859, and Tuscany became a province of the united [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861.\n\n[[File:Oswald Achenbach 003.jpg|thumb|250px|Florence in 1898, a painting by [[Oswald Achenbach]].]]\nFlorence replaced [[Turin]] as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emmanuele II]], then [[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]], the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Poet [[Antonio Pucci (poet)|Antonio Pucci]] had written in the 14th century, \"There was never so noble a garden as when in Mercato Vecchio the eyes and tastes of the Florentines did feast.\" The area had, however, decayed from its original medieval splendor. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today. The country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later after the withdrawal of the French troops made its addition to the kingdom possible. A very important role is played in these years by the famous Florentine caf\u00e9 [[Caff\u00e8 Giubbe Rosse|Giubbe Rosse]] from its foundation until the present day.\n\n==20th century==\nIn the 19th century, the population of Florence doubled to over 230,000, and in the 20th century reached over 450,000 at one point with the growth of tourism, trade, financial services and the industry. A foreign community came to represent one-quarter of the population in the second half of the 19th century and of this period and writers such as [[James Irving (writer)|James Irving]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|pre-Raphaelite artists]] captured a romantic vision of the city in their works. Numerous villas of mainly English barons with their eclectic collections of art were bequeathed to the city in this era. Today they are occupied by museums such as the [[Horne Museum]], the [[Stibbert Museum]], [[Villa La Pietra]], etc.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943\u20131944). On September 25, 1943, Allied bombers targeted central Florence, destroying many buildings and killed 215 civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoomedia.it/Firenze/storia/1900/liberazione/25settembre/index.html|title=25 settembre 1943 bombardamento di Firenze - Zoomedia.it|work=zoomedia.it}}</ref>\n[[File:The Ponte Vecchio bridge in Florence, damaged by the retreating Germans who blew up buildings at each, 14 August 1944.

New Zealand troops stormed the Pian dei Cerri hills overlooking the city. After several days of fighting, German forces retreated and gave way.\n\nDuring the German retreat, Florence was declared an undefended \"[[open city]]\", prohibiting further shelling and bombing in accordance with the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]].  On 4 August, the retreating Germans decided to detonate charges along the bridges of the Arno linking the district of [[Oltrarno]] to the rest of the city, thus making it difficult for the New Zealand, South African and British troops to cross just before liberation. The German officer in charge of the demolitions, [[Gerhard Wolf]], ordered that the [[Ponte Vecchio]] was to be spared. Before the war, Wolf had been a student in the city, and his decision has been honored with a memorial plaque on the bridge. Instead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the [[Vasari Corridor|Corridoio Vasariano]], was destroyed using mines.<ref>{{cite book | first=Gene | last=Brucker | year=1983 | title=Renaissance Florence | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=0-520-04695-1 | pages=8}}</ref> Since then, the bridges have been restored exactly to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design.

There was no warning from the authorities who knew the flood was coming except a phone call to the jewellers on the Ponte Vecchio.
