He mistakenly sets camp in the neighborhood of Bugs' rabbit hole, and Bugs (and a neighboring bear) don't have much leisure in mind. It was the first Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett|Robert Clampett]], with a story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by [[Carl Stalling]]. [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]] is the only credited animator, although [[Virgil Ross]], [[Rod Scribner]], and [[Robert McKimson]] also animated the short. [[Mel Blanc]] provided the voices for Bugs and the [[bear]], and [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] provided the voice for Elmer.\n\n==Plot==\nElmer, driving his [[Ford Model T]] [[jalopy]] to a [[Conga (music)|Conga]] beat, makes his way to Jellostone National Park (a pun on [[Yellowstone National Park]]) while looking forward to getting some rest. Elmer sets up his campsite by setting a camp fire, an hanging mirror on a tree and, beneath it, a wash basin on a table, hanging a hammock, and pitching his tent. The tent is positioned directly over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole (just as Elmer had arrived, Bugs had posted a sign next to his hole saying 'Camp Here', then had retreated into the lair, covering it with grass as he went). From down there, Bugs breaks down the tent and drags it inside. Elmer reaches in and, in spite of resistance from below, retrieves the tent which is tied in knots. Bugs pops up, welcomes Elmer to Jellostone (\"a restful retreat. Oh brudda!\") and pulls Elmer's hat over his eyes. Elmer reaches in again and tries to yank Bugs out. After several attempts, Elmer pulls his hands out to find that his fingers are tied together. He nails a board over the hole (\"that'll hold 'em alwhight, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\"). However, Bugs simply pushes it open, steps out and mimics Elmer. Bugs balloons up to Elmer's size and repeats what Elmer had said, labeling it \"phooey\". Elmer then settles into his hammock and quickly falls fast asleep, muttering to himself.\n\nBugs places a pair of glasses on Elmer's face, paints the lenses black and sets the alarm clock to go off at noon. When it wakes Elmer, he thinks it is nighttime because everything seems dark. He goes to his tent, takes off his day clothes to reveal night clothes underneath, and goes to bed. Bugs then removes the glasses from Elmer and crows like a rooster, awakening Elmer who believes it is the next morning.\n\nElmer washes his face but cannot reach his towel because it is hanging on a branch that Bugs keeps at a steady, short distance from him. Elmer blindly follows the towel (\"I do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture\", Bugs [[Breaking the fourth wall|confides to the audience]]). He causes Elmer to step off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the [[Grand Canyon]], but suddenly realizes he is in midair. He runs back to safety and holds on to Bugs for dear life. Bugs then admits he is the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.\n\nThe bear soon gives up (after sniffing Elmer's \"[[Body odor|B.O.]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 his feet), but Bugs climbs onto Elmer and starts growling exactly like the bear. He misbehaves in various ways to keep Elmer on the ground with his eyes shut, but just as he starts biting Elmer's foot, Elmer sees what is going on and grabs his shotgun. The bear returns and Bugs runs away just as Elmer swings the gun, clobbering the bear rather than the rabbit.  A chase ensues with Elmer and the bear running through the trees to the tune of the \"[[William Tell Overture]].\" Finally, the bear freaks Elmer out by riding on top of him.\n\nWhen the bear is knocked off him after hitting a tree branch, Elmer gives up and packs everything into his car (almost including a huge tree). He passes the welcome sign at the gate on his way out, backs up and reads it again. He declares its promise of \"a restful retreat\" to be \"bawogney!\" and, to teach the park not to give false advertisement, he chops the sign to bits with an ax and stomps on the pieces while calling the park's \"peace and wewaxation\" promises \"wubbish!\" A ranger (along with Bugs) appears, and has an angry expression on his face. Elmer is arrested for the destruction of government property, and from his jail cell window he tells us that \"anyway\" he is \"wid of that gwizzwy bear and scwewy wabbit! West and wewaxation at wast!\" Unfortunately, he turns to find out that somehow he is sharing his cell with both Bugs ''and'' the black bear. They both ask how long he has in jail (\"Pardon me but, how long ya in for, doc?\" they ask).\n\n==Production==\nFor the cartoon, Elmer was redesigned as a fat man (based on voice actor [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]'s own physique) in an attempt to make him funnier. The \"fat Elmer\" would only make three more appearances in the ''Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies'' canon&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Wabbit Who Came to Supper]]'', ''[[The Wacky Wabbit]]'' and ''[[Fresh Hare]]'', in addition to a [[cameo appearance]] in the non-canon war bond advertisement ''[[Any Bonds Today?]]''&nbsp;\u2013 before returning to the slimmer form by which he is better known, for ''[[The Hare-Brained Hypnotist]]''. This cartoon was the only time, though, that the Fat Elmer also had a red nose. This is the only cartoon with the \"fat\" version of Elmer to remain under copyright; the other \"fat Elmer\" cartoons are in the public domain.\n\nBugs would show up in a prison two more times: in ''[[Rebel Rabbit]]'' (1949) and ''[[Big House Bunny]]'' (1950). At the ends of ''[[Rabbit Transit (cartoon)|Rabbit Transit]]'' (1947) and ''[[Hare Brush]]'' (1955) he is arrested, but not actually shown in prison therein.\n\nThe lobby card where Bugs paints Elmer's glasses black is also done in the film.\n\n==Availability==\n* DVD - ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'', Volume 1\n* Blu-ray - ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection]]'', Volume 2\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Big Chungus.png|200px|thumb|The still frame from the short that has come to be known as \"Big Chungus\".]]\nIn December 2018, a still from the short depicting Bugs mocking Elmer by imitating his weight became an [[Internet meme]].

Wallich also donated a number of botanical specimens to the museum from his personal collection.\nIn 1815, Mr William Lloyd Gibbons, Asst Secretary and Librarian was appointed Joint Joint Secretary of the Museum.\n\nAfter the resignation of Wallich, curators were paid salaries by the Asiatic Society ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a month. However, when in  1836 when the bankers of Asiatic Society (Palmer and Company) became insolvent and the Government began to pay the salary of the Curator from its public funds since a large part of the collection was that of the surveyors of Survey of India.\n\nA temporary grant of Rs 200 per month was sanctioned for maintenance of the museum and library, and J. T. Pearson of the Bengal Medical Service was appointed curator followed shortly by [[John McClelland (doctor)|John McClelland]] and after his resignation by [[Edward Blyth]].\n\nIn 1840, the Government took a keen interest in the [[geology]] and mineral resources and this led to an additional grant of Rs 250 per month for the geological section alone. In 1851 when the Geological Survey of India came into being with the advent of Sir Thomas Oldham, a rented building at 1, Hastings Road now K N Roy Road, the present site of the New Secretariat became its office. The geological collection of the Government of India 'Museum of Economic Geology' at the Asiatic Society, were then transferred to this site in 1856. The Asiatic Society geological collection were however held back with the condition that it would be handed over to the GSI once a Museum for all its collection came into being. \nIt was way back in 1837 that Sir James Princeps then-Secretary of Asiatic Society had written to the Government asking for a Museum at a cost to the state. A movement for a full-fledged Museum was thereafter keenly pursued over a decade and later with Sir Thomas Oldham then Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India at the helm it gained momentum.\n\nThe thrust for a full fledged Museum was held up due to the intervention of the revolt of the sepoys of the East India Company. \nThe matter was pursued again, once things settled down after India came under the Crown.\n\nThereafter the First Indian Museum Act was passed in 1866 and the foundation of the Indian Museum at its present site laid in 1867. In 1875 the present building on \nChowringee Road, presently Jawaharlal Nehru Road, designed by W L Granville in consultation with Sir Thomas Holland, on Chowringee was completed. In 1877 after the retirment of Sir Thomas Oldham in 1876 the Geological Survey of India including the Museum of Economic Geology shifted here from its rented accommodation on 1 Hastings Road.\n\nThis building had been designated as the site the for not just the Asiatic Societies, Oriental Museum's collection and the Economic Geology collection of the Geological Survey of India but also to hold the offices of both.\n\nThe Asiatic Society however relinquished its rights preferring to maintain its autonomy from the government. The Geological Survey of India is till date Head Quartered, at the buildings of the Indian Museum Complex and holds exclusive rights over the Geological galleries of the Indian Museum.\nThe building parallel to Sudder Street commenced in 1988 and occupied in 1891. The next building block at right angle to Sudder Street was erected in 1894. Half of this building was consigned to the Geological Survey of India but by 1912 it was wholly transferred to it.\n \nThe Zoological and Anthropological sections of the museum gave rise to the [[Zoological Survey of India]] in 1916, which in turn gave rise to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]] in 1945.<ref name=\"Weber\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/app-k/textk.htm \n |title=Appendix K: The Anthropological Survey of India (The Andamanese by George Weber) \n |date=10 September 2005 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525004432/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/app-k/textk.htm \n |archivedate=25 May 2006 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref>\n\nThe Scottish anatomist and zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]] took up the position of curator in 1865, and catalogued the mammal and archaeology collections.

In 1872, the Patriarchate accused the Exarchate that it introduced ''ethno-national'' characteristics in the religious organization of the Orthodox Church, and the secession from the Patriarchate was officially condemned by the Council in Constantinople in September 1872 as [[Schism (religion)|schism]]atic. Nevertheless, Bulgarian religious leaders continued to extend the borders of the Exarchate in the Ottoman Empire by conducting plebiscites in areas contested by both Churches.<ref>From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870\u20131913, Theodora Dragostinova , Ohio State University, Columbus.</ref>\n\nIn this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created under the name [[Bulgar Millet]].<ref>A Concise History of Bulgaria, R.

In History of Slav-Bulgarians, Paisius urged his compatriots to throw off subjugation to the Greek language and culture. The example of Paisius was followed by others, including Saint [[Sofroni Vrachanski|Sophroniy of Vratsa]] (1739\u20131813), Abbot [[Spiridon of Gabrovo]] (died 1815),  Abbot [[Yoakim Karchovski]] (died 1820), and Abbot [[Kiril Peychinovich]] (died 1845).\n\nStruggle for church autonomy<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kalkandjieva|first1=Daniela|title=\u2018The Bulgarian Orthodox Church\u2019 in L.

Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek clergy started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses as early as the 1820s.\n\nIt was not, however, until the 1850 that the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the Greek clerics in a number of bishoprics demanding their replacement with Bulgarian ones as well as other changes such as the use of Bulgarian in liturgy and fixed salaries for bishops. By that time, most Bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the [[Bulgarians]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nAs the Ottomans identified nationality (ethnicity) with [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and the majority of ethnic Bulgarians were Orthodox Christians, they were automatically included in the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)#Orthodox Christians|R\u016bm millet]], a community ruled immediately by the Ecumenical Patriarch in his capacity of millet-bashi and dominated by [[Phanar]] [[Greeks]] ([[Phanariots]]). Thus, if the Bulgarians wanted to have Bulgarian schools and liturgy in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], they needed an autonomous ecclesiastical organisation.\n\nThe struggle between the Bulgarians, led by [[Neofit Bozveli]] and [[Ilarion Makariopolski|Ilarion Stoyanov]], and the [[Phanariotes]] intensified throughout the 1860s. As the Greek clerics were ousted from most Bulgarian bishoprics at the end of the decade, the whole of northern Bulgaria, as well as the northern parts of [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] had, to all intents and purposes, seceded from the Patriarchate.\n\n==Establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate==\n[[File:Sultan\u2019s Ferman for the establishment of a Bulgarian Exarchate 1.jpg|left|thumb|Firman of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz for the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate.]]\n[[File:Bulgarian-Exarchate-1870-1913.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Map of the Bulgarian Exarchate (1870\u20131913).]]\nIn seeking to calm down the disturbances, the Ottoman government of the [[Ottoman dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] granted the right to establish an autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate for the dioceses of Bulgaria as well as those, wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it, by issuing the Sultan's [[firman (decree)|firman]] promulgated on {{OldStyleDate|March 12|1870|February 28}}.

After the Christian population of the bishoprics of [[Skopje]] and [[Ohrid]] voted in 1874  overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%)<ref>[http://www.promacedonia.org/pp_ht/pp_ht_4.html \u0426\u044a\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0446\u044a\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0432 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0422\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 2003 \u0433.]</ref> the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of [[Ottoman_Vardar_Macedonia|Vardar]] and [[Pirin Macedonia]].

Furthermore on January 21st 1872, on request of the Patriarch and under the influence of Count [[Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev|Nikolai Ignatiev]], then an influential Russian Ambassador in Constantinople, the Ottoman government sent into exile in [[Izmir]], [[Anatolia]] three Bulgarian clerks [[Hilarion of Makariopolis]], [[Panaret of Plovdiv]] and [[Hilarion of Lovech]]. The energetic protests of the Bulgarian community in Istanbul, reverts the decision short after.\n\nThe Russian [[Most Holy Synod]] claimed neutrality, but the Russian government, represented by Count [[Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev|Nikolai Ignatiev]], actively mediated in the Greek-Bulgarian dispute. The unity of the Orthodox Church was instrumental for Russian's political interests in the Orthodox world. The attempts though to satisfy the Greek Patriarchate by reducing the territories of the Bulgarian Exarchate (noticeably [[Ottoman_Vardar_Macedonia|Vardar]], [[Pirin Macedonia|Pirin]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), proved fruitless and against the Bulgarian interests. <ref>Simeon Radev, \"The Builders of Modern Bulgaria\", volume 1, chapter 3, [http://www.slovo.bg/showwork.php3?AuID=101&WorkID=2846&Level=3 The Russian Politics and The Bulgarian Church]</ref>\n\n[[File:NHMB-Seal-of-Bulgarian-Exarchate-1872.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Seal of Bulgarian-Exarchate, 1872]]\nExarch Antim I was discharged by the Ottoman government immediately after the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]] on April 24, 1877, and was sent into exile in [[Ankara]]. Under the guidance of his successor, [[Joseph I of Bulgaria|Joseph I]], the Exarchate managed to develop and considerably extend its church and school network in the Bulgarian Principality, [[Eastern Rumelia]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]]. In 1879, the [[Tarnovo Constitution]] formally established the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as the national religion of the nation. On the eve of the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912, in the Ottoman Macedonian [[vilayet]]s and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]] alone, the Bulgarian Exarchate had seven dioceses with prelates and eight more with acting chairmen in charge and 38 vicariates, 1,218 parishes and 1,310 parish priests, 1331 churches, 73 monasteries and 234 chapels, as well as 1,373 schools with 2,266 teachers and 78,854 pupils.

The Serbians expelled Exarchist churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgarian schools and churches (affecting the standing of as many as 641 schools and 761 churches).

[[Mel Blanc]] played both [[Bugs Bunny]] and the Scotsman.\n\nThe title is an obvious play on the second line of the old song, \"[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]\". The seven-minute short has been released on [[DVD]] multiple times in different compilation discs, and {{As of|2003|lc=on}} is available on  the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]''. And, though this cartoon was the Scotsman's (named Angus MacRory) only theatrical appearance, he also made his second major role in \"''It's a Plaid, Plaid, Plaid, Plaid World''\" episode (released on February 3, 1996) in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]''. The Scotsman appeared briefly in a 1989 TV special and on a couple of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episodes. He can also be seen in the 1996 hit film, ''[[Space Jam]]'', watching the Toon Squad/[[Michael Jordan]] [[basketball]] [[game]].\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nThis cartoon begins as [[Bugs Bunny]] once again gets lost when he is tunneling to his vacation spot. He accidentally ends up near [[Loch Lomond]], [[Scotland]], instead of the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], having once again not \"made that left toin at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albahkoiky]]!\", and mistakes a Scotsman named Angus MacRory in [[Highland dress]] and playing the [[bagpipes]] for a lady being attacked by a \"horrible monster\". Bugs jumps MacRory trying to rescue the \"woman\", and in the process he smashes his bagpipes to pieces. \n\nMacRory becomes enraged that his bagpipes have been absolutely ruined. He yells at Bugs, who is surprised that MacRory is actually a man wearing a [[kilt]], which bears a resemblance to a [[skirt]]. Bugs declares that such garb \"ain't decent\", and throws a [[bankruptcy barrel|barrel]] over MacRory for [[indecent exposure]]. \n\nBugs then asks MacRory for the directions to the \"La Brea Tar Pits in [[Los Angeles|Los Ahn-galays]]\", causing the Scotsman to threaten Bugs with a [[blunderbuss]], telling the rabbit \"there are no La Brea Tar Pits in ''Scotland''!\" When Bugs realizes the location he is in, he bids MacRory \"Eh, what's up, MacDoc?\", and runs for it just as MacRory shoots. MacRory chases after the [[bullet]] and picks it up (\"It's been in the family for years\"), reloads the bullet back into his gun, and shoots at Bugs repeatedly, who dives back into his hole (which MacRory fires into) and comes back out moments later thinly disguised as an elderly Scotsman accusing MacRory (whose last name is revealed by the disguised Bugs) of \"[[poaching]] on [his] property\". MacRory doesn't believe him, however, and challenges him to a traditional Scottish duel \u2014 a game. Bugs, upon hearing this, sets up a [[card game]]. MacRory corrects him, stating the challenge is a game of [[golf]]; Bugs then asks MacRory: \"Don't ya get a little tired running them 18 bases?\"\n \nThroughout the golf game, Bugs continually outsmarts the Scotsman. On the first hole, Bugs focuses on swinging the ball, looks down at the Scotsman for tapping his foot impatiently. MacRory stops tapping, and sheepishly hides his foot behind his other leg. Bugs takes his swing, and the ball veers off course; so Bugs digs another, bigger hole to earn a [[hole in one]] (with the real hole shown to be off in the distance). Bugs then nails MacRory's ball to the tee so that it won't go anywhere (\"Fore!\" \"Four? Three-and-a-half.\"); but MacRory gets a hole in one anyway (ending up in the hole himself), to Bugs's protests (\"A hole in one? Why, you little cheater!\" You little four flusher! Why, you can't...\"). \n\nOn the 8th hole, MacRory laughs at Bugs, whose ball has fallen shorter of the hole than MacRory's. Bugs then turns his club into a pool cue, and hits a bank shot into the hole, causing MacRory to break his own club in half in anger. \n\nLater, after being seen hitting his ball out of a bunker multiple times to get his ball in hole 16, Bugs figures how many strokes to write on his scoreboard. After he goes through elaborate motions of doing addition in the air, he announces his score: \"Two.\" MacRory, not believing Bugs at all, counters: \"Two? FIFTY-FIVE!\" An [[auction]] ensues, with Bugs acting as the auctioneer and continually lowering the score, until MacRory offers \"one\" as his \"final offer\".\n\nAt the last hole, MacRory gets a hole in one. Bugs however misses the hole altogether and quickly digs a channel with his club for the ball to roll through into the hole. Bugs then declares himself the winner, whereupon the Scotsman accuses him of cheating. But Bugs defends himself with a list of phony \"historical\" citations: \"Why, that identical situation occurred in the [[New Hebrides]] Open. Kaduffleblaze versus Fuddle in 19-aught-18. And what about Fradis versus Ginfritter? Hah! Bizbo versus Stoigen in the Casablanca Amateur. Cheating, indeed! The noive!\"\n\nThe Scotsman, realising that \"the weight of evidence is greatly against him\", accepts defeat; but he still claims that he can't be beaten when it comes to playing bagpipes, and he grabs the instrument to demonstrate. After playing, he dares Bugs to try and top that \u2014 which the rabbit does by dressing like a Scot and playing not only the pipes, but also a [[trombone]], a [[saxophone]], a [[trumpet]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[cymbal]]s on his feet, and a [[bass drum]] on his head with the beaters tied to his ears, in the manner of a [[one-man band]]. Bugs takes a final glimpse at the audience and waggles his eyebrow, before an [[Iris out|iris-out]].\n\n==Other Appearances==\n* ''[[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons#TV specials|Bugs Bunny's Wild World of Sports]]'': In this 1989 TV special, the Scotsman from the cartoon appears as a guest at the \"Sportsman of the Year\" awards banquet, as one of the nominees for the award. He is named by his full name for the first time when the announcer introduces him as, \"That great Scottish golfer, Angus MacRory.\" Angus corrects the pronunciation of his name, and adds that it's spelled, \"With fourteen r's.\" The special also shows clips from ''My Bunny Lies Over the Sea.''\n* ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'': The Scotsman from the cartoon makes his second major role in the \"It's a Plaid, Plaid, Plaid, Plaid World\" episode. His full name, \"Angus MacRory\" is confirmed. He is revealed to be Granny's fourth cousin twice removed.\n* ''[[Animaniacs]]'': In the ''Dot's Quiet Time'' segment, when Dot is in Scotland, having finally found a quiet place, the Scotsman walks by Dot playing his bagpipes, disturbing her.

[[Mel Blanc]] played both [[Bugs Bunny]] and the Scotsman.\n\nThe title is an obvious play on the second line of the old song, \"[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]\". The seven-minute short has been released on [[DVD]] multiple times in different compilation discs, and {{As of|2003|lc=on}} is available on  the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]''. And, though this cartoon was the Scotsman's (named Angus MacRory) only theatrical appearance, he also made his second major role in \"''It's a Plaid, Plaid, Plaid, Plaid World''\" episode (released on February 3, 1996) in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]''. The Scotsman appeared briefly in a 1989 TV special and on a couple of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episodes. He can also be seen in the 1996 hit film, ''[[Space Jam]]'', watching the Toon Squad/[[Michael Jordan]] [[basketball]] [[game]].\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nThis cartoon begins as [[Bugs Bunny]] once again gets lost when he is tunneling to his vacation spot. He accidentally ends up near [[Loch Lomond]], [[Scotland]], instead of the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], having once again not \"made that left toin at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albahkoiky]]!\", and mistakes a Scotsman named Angus MacRory in [[Highland dress]] and playing the [[bagpipes]] for a lady being attacked by a \"horrible monster\". Bugs jumps MacRory trying to rescue the \"woman\", and in the process he smashes his bagpipes to pieces. \n\nMacRory becomes enraged that his bagpipes have been absolutely ruined. He yells at Bugs, who is surprised that MacRory is actually a man wearing a [[kilt]], which bears a resemblance to a [[skirt]]. Bugs declares that such garb \"ain't decent\", and throws a [[bankruptcy barrel|barrel]] over MacRory for [[indecent exposure]]. \n\nBugs then asks MacRory for the directions to the \"La Brea Tar Pits in [[Los Angeles|Los Ahn-galays]]\", causing the Scotsman to threaten Bugs with a [[blunderbuss]], telling the rabbit \"there are no La Brea Tar Pits in ''Scotland''!\" When Bugs realizes the location he is in, he bids MacRory \"Eh, what's up, MacDoc?\", and runs for it just as MacRory shoots. MacRory chases after the [[bullet]] and picks it up (\"It's been in the family for years\"), reloads the bullet back into his gun, and shoots at Bugs repeatedly, who dives back into his hole (which MacRory fires into) and comes back out moments later thinly disguised as an elderly Scotsman accusing MacRory (whose last name is revealed by the disguised Bugs) of \"[[poaching]] on [his] property\". MacRory doesn't believe him, however, and challenges him to a traditional Scottish duel \u2014 a game. Bugs, upon hearing this, sets up a [[card game]]. MacRory corrects him, stating the challenge is a game of [[golf]]; Bugs then asks MacRory: \"Don't ya get a little tired running them 18 bases?\"\n \nThroughout the golf game, Bugs continually outsmarts the Scotsman. On the first hole, Bugs focuses on swinging the ball, looks down at the Scotsman for tapping his foot impatiently. MacRory stops tapping, and sheepishly hides his foot behind his other leg. Bugs takes his swing, and the ball veers off course; so Bugs digs another, bigger hole to earn a [[hole in one]] (with the real hole shown to be off in the distance). Bugs then nails MacRory's ball to the tee so that it won't go anywhere (\"Fore!\" \"Four? Three-and-a-half.\"); but MacRory gets a hole in one anyway (ending up in the hole himself), to Bugs's protests (\"A hole in one? Why, you little cheater!\" You little four flusher! Why, you can't...\"). \n\nOn the 8th hole, MacRory laughs at Bugs, whose ball has fallen shorter of the hole than MacRory's. Bugs then turns his club into a pool cue, and hits a bank shot into the hole, causing MacRory to break his own club in half in anger. \n\nLater, after being seen hitting his ball out of a bunker multiple times to get his ball in hole 16, Bugs figures how many strokes to write on his scoreboard. After he goes through elaborate motions of doing addition in the air, he announces his score: \"Two.\" MacRory, not believing Bugs at all, counters: \"Two? FIFTY-FIVE!\" An [[auction]] ensues, with Bugs acting as the auctioneer and continually lowering the score, until MacRory offers \"one\" as his \"final offer\".\n\nAt the last hole, MacRory gets a hole in one. Bugs however misses the hole altogether and quickly digs a channel with his club for the ball to roll through into the hole. Bugs then declares himself the winner, whereupon the Scotsman accuses him of cheating. But Bugs defends himself with a list of phony \"historical\" citations: \"Why, that identical situation occurred in the [[New Hebrides]] Open. Kaduffleblaze versus Fuddle in 19-aught-18. And what about Fradis versus Ginfritter? Hah! Bizbo versus Stoigen in the Casablanca Amateur. Cheating, indeed! The noive!\"\n\nThe Scotsman, realising that \"the weight of evidence is greatly against him\", accepts defeat; but he still claims that he can't be beaten when it comes to playing bagpipes, and he grabs the instrument to demonstrate. After playing, he dares Bugs to try and top that \u2014 which the rabbit does by dressing like a Scot and playing not only the pipes, but also a [[trombone]], a [[saxophone]], a [[trumpet]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[cymbal]]s on his feet, and a [[bass drum]] on his head with the beaters tied to his ears, in the manner of a [[one-man band]]. Bugs takes a final glimpse at the audience and waggles his eyebrow, before an [[Iris out|iris-out]].\n\n==Other Appearances==\n* ''[[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons#TV specials|Bugs Bunny's Wild World of Sports]]'': In this 1989 TV special, the Scotsman from the cartoon appears as a guest at the \"Sportsman of the Year\" awards banquet, as one of the nominees for the award.
