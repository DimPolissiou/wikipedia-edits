In April 1889, Jeff Reed (a native Texan and relative of the Daggs family) was appointed to carry the mail from [[Stonewall, Oklahoma|Stonewall]] to Center (which was later combined with Pickett), two small communities in then Indian Territory. With his family and his stock, he sought a place for a home on a prairie midway between the two points, where he constructed a log house and started Reed's Store. Other settlers soon built homes nearby. In 1891, a post office was established and named after Reed's oldest daughter, Ada.<ref name=\"historyada\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100922033206/http://adaok.com/history_of_ada.htm City of Ada, OK] (accessed February 23, 2007).</ref> Ada incorporated as a city in 1901 and grew rapidly with the arrival of the [[St. Louis and San Francisco Railway]] line.

Two men had been tried and convicted of the murder of Debra Sue \"Debbie\" Carter. After twelve years on death row, DNA evidence proved the men's innocence and established the guilt of the prosecution's main witness. Similar problems surrounded the trials of the two men convicted for the murder of Denice Haraway. Two of the books examining these cases are ''[[The Dreams of Ada]]'' (1987) by Robert Mayer and ''[[The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town|The Innocent Man]]'', Grisham's first non-fiction book.  Accounts from both books suggest major flaws, irregularities, and outright miscarriages of justice including forced and made-up confessions by the police and prosecutors.  Prosecutor Bill Peterson has self-published his disagreements with Grisham's version of events.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/burden/profiles/williamson.html Frontline: burden of innocence] (accessed November 13, 2008)</ref><ref>[http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/295.php The Innocence Project] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080919005615/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/295.php |date=2008-09-19 }} (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref><ref>[http://www.billpetersondistrictattorney.com/ Grisham's Folly] (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Ada (Oklahoma)}}\n{{Commons category|Ada, Oklahoma}}\n* [http://www.adaok.com City website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070405162732/http://www.adaworks.org/ Ada Jobs Foundation website]\n* [http://www.adahub.com Community website]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/asherok/sets/72157606523702554/ Ada photos on Flickr (unofficial)]\n* [http://www.okcommerce.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=4&id=99&Itemid=667 Oklahoma Main Street Community program]\n*http://www.adachamber.com/\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100412071240/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AD001.html Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture -

In April 1889, Jeff Reed (a native Texan and relative of the Daggs family) was appointed to carry the mail from [[Stonewall, Oklahoma|Stonewall]] to Center (which was later combined with Pickett), two small communities in then Indian Territory. With his family and his stock, he sought a place for a home on a prairie midway between the two points, where he constructed a log house and started Reed's Store. Other settlers soon built homes nearby. In 1891, a post office was established and named after Reed's oldest daughter, Ada.<ref name=\"historyada\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100922033206/http://adaok.com/history_of_ada.htm City of Ada, OK] (accessed February 23, 2007).</ref> Ada incorporated as a city in 1901 and grew rapidly with the arrival of the [[St. Louis and San Francisco Railway]] line.

Two men had been tried and convicted of the murder of Debra Sue \"Debbie\" Carter. After twelve years on death row, DNA evidence proved the men's innocence and established the guilt of the prosecution's main witness. Similar problems surrounded the trials of the two men convicted for the murder of Denice Haraway. Two of the books examining these cases are ''[[The Dreams of Ada]]'' (1987) by Robert Mayer and ''[[The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town|The Innocent Man]]'', Grisham's first non-fiction book.  Accounts from both books suggest major flaws, irregularities, and outright miscarriages of justice including forced and made-up confessions by the police and prosecutors.

Pittsburgh Festival Opera performs at non-traditional venues around the city.\n\nPittsburgh Festival Opera (PFO) was established in 1978 by the noted opera star [[Mildred Miller|Mildred Miller Posvar]] and Helen Knox. In 2012, Pittsburgh Festival Opera reinvented itself as a summer festival presenting staged operas, musicals, recitals, and cabaret.<ref>http://blogs.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/arts-a-entertainment/classical-musings/28881-opera-theater-to-be-a-summer-festival</ref> \n\nPFO is currently under the leadership of Executive Director Christopher Powell and Artistic Director Marianne Cornetti who both joined the company in 2019.\n\n\n==Activities==\nArtistic initiatives have included a Music that Matters series, exploring new work that tells socially relevant stories, a ''Fusion Festival'' of American-Asian works at the Andy Warhol Museum which included the world premiere of ''RedDust'', a multi-media opera by Mathew Rosenblum and ''The Sound of a Voice'' by Philip Glass and David Henry Hwang. Other projects have included the Pittsburgh ''Ring'', two complete cycles of Wagner's great operas in collaboration with Long Beach Opera using Jonathan Dove's orchestral reduction.  Recent American operas include A Gathering of Sons, ''Just Above My Head'', a world premiere jazz opera by Pittsburgher Nathan Davis. Operatic versions of classics American plays have included Lee Hoiby's ''Summer and Smoke'', William Bolcom's ''A View From the Bridge'' and ''Regina'', an operatic version of ''The Little Foxes'' by Marc Blitzstein. In 2020, Pittsburgh Festival Opera premieres Virgula Divina by Karen Brown and Jessica Lanay.\n\nAside from forays in the traditional repertory, PFO has sought to present a number of modern masterpieces which are not regularly included on standard programs: ''Lost in the Stars'', ''The Emperor of Atlantis'', ''Bluebeard's Castle'', ''Brundibar'', ''Der Jasager'', and the English language premiere of Weill's ''Die B\u00fcrgschaft''.\n\nPast productions also include a \"Salon Series\" devoted to shorter works performed in unusual spaces, such as Puccini's ''Gianni Schicchi'', performed in a church converted into an art gallery; Bizet's ''Djamileh'', presented in a Persian Carpet Emporium; Thomas Pasatieri's ''La Divina'', and Salieri's ''Prima la Musica, e Poi le Parole'', performed in Pittsburgh's own version of the Petit Trianon Palace.\n\n\n==The Mildred Miller International Voice Competition==\n\nPittsburgh Festival Opera annually hosts the Mildred Miller International Voice Competition in honor of its founder, Mildred Miller Posvar. The event, held in Pittsburgh, is a search for America's best singers. Young professionals aged 18\u201335 are eligible to compete for cash prizes and solo roles in the company's summer Festival. Past competition winners include Juan Jos\u00e9 de Leon, Andrey Nemzer, Meghan Kasanders, Alasdair Kent, Karen Chia-ling Ho, and Elizabeth Baldwin.\n\nPFO previously celebrated annually ''The Millie Awards''. The purpose was to reflect several diverse aspects of Mildred Miller's distinguished career - singing, acting, community service and education. The \"Millies\", as they are affectionately called, recognize and show appreciation for high accomplishments in the performing arts, honoring those individuals whose support has been instrumental in the success of Pittsburgh Festival Opera.\n\n==Community Engagement and Education==\n\nPittsburgh Festival Opera's engagement with its community is of primary importance. Working directly with schools as well as in partnership with fellow non-profit organizations, PFO has taken opera to more than 500,000 school children in its 42 year history. In addition, it actively seeks opportunities to include students in productions, exceeding state standards for direct arts experiences and creating partnerships with the communities and the families for which it performs.\n\n==Record of Repertory==\n\n\n<ref>http://www.pittsburghfestivalopera.org</ref>\n'''Festival 2018 - July 6\u2013July 22, 2018'''\n\n*''La Boh\u00e8me Warhola'' by Giacomo Puccini\n*''Arabella'' by Richard Strauss\n*''Rhinegold'' by Richard Wagner\n*''Goldie B.

Pittsburgh Festival Opera performs at non-traditional venues around the city.\n\nPittsburgh Festival Opera (PFO) was established in 1978 by the noted opera star [[Mildred Miller|Mildred Miller Posvar]] and Helen Knox. In 2012, Pittsburgh Festival Opera reinvented itself as a summer festival presenting staged operas, musicals, recitals, and cabaret.<ref>http://blogs.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/arts-a-entertainment/classical-musings/28881-opera-theater-to-be-a-summer-festival</ref> \n\nPFO is currently under the leadership of Executive Director Christopher Powell and Artistic Director Marianne Cornetti who both joined the company in 2019.\n\n\n==Activities==\nArtistic initiatives have included a Music that Matters series, exploring new work that tells socially relevant stories, a ''Fusion Festival'' of American-Asian works at the Andy Warhol Museum which included the world premiere of ''RedDust'', a multi-media opera by Mathew Rosenblum and ''The Sound of a Voice'' by Philip Glass and David Henry Hwang. Other projects have included the Pittsburgh ''Ring'', two complete cycles of Wagner's great operas in collaboration with Long Beach Opera using Jonathan Dove's orchestral reduction.  Recent American operas include A Gathering of Sons, ''Just Above My Head'', a world premiere jazz opera by Pittsburgher Nathan Davis. Operatic versions of classics American plays have included Lee Hoiby's ''Summer and Smoke'', William Bolcom's ''A View From the Bridge'' and ''Regina'', an operatic version of ''The Little Foxes'' by Marc Blitzstein. In 2020, Pittsburgh Festival Opera premieres Virgula Divina by Karen Brown and Jessica Lanay.\n\nAside from forays in the traditional repertory, PFO has sought to present a number of modern masterpieces which are not regularly included on standard programs: ''Lost in the Stars'', ''The Emperor of Atlantis'', ''Bluebeard's Castle'', ''Brundibar'', ''Der Jasager'', and the English language premiere of Weill's ''Die B\u00fcrgschaft''.\n\nPast productions also include a \"Salon Series\" devoted to shorter works performed in unusual spaces, such as Puccini's ''Gianni Schicchi'', performed in a church converted into an art gallery; Bizet's ''Djamileh'', presented in a Persian Carpet Emporium; Thomas Pasatieri's ''La Divina'', and Salieri's ''Prima la Musica, e Poi le Parole'', performed in Pittsburgh's own version of the Petit Trianon Palace.\n\n\n==The Mildred Miller International Voice Competition==\n\nPittsburgh Festival Opera annually hosts the Mildred Miller International Voice Competition in honor of its founder, Mildred Miller Posvar. The event, held in Pittsburgh, is a search for America's best singers. Young professionals aged 18\u201335 are eligible to compete for cash prizes and solo roles in the company's summer Festival. Past competition winners include Juan Jos\u00e9 de Leon, Andrey Nemzer, Meghan Kasanders, Alasdair Kent, Karen Chia-ling Ho, and Elizabeth Baldwin.\n\nPFO previously celebrated annually ''The Millie Awards''. The purpose was to reflect several diverse aspects of Mildred Miller's distinguished career - singing, acting, community service and education. The \"Millies\", as they are affectionately called, recognize and show appreciation for high accomplishments in the performing arts, honoring those individuals whose support has been instrumental in the success of Pittsburgh Festival Opera.\n\n==Community Engagement and Education==\n\nPittsburgh Festival Opera's engagement with its community is of primary importance. Working directly with schools as well as in partnership with fellow non-profit organizations, PFO has taken opera to more than 500,000 school children in its 42 year history. In addition, it actively seeks opportunities to include students in productions, exceeding state standards for direct arts experiences and creating partnerships with the communities and the families for which it performs.\n\n==Record of Repertory==\n\n\n<ref>http://www.pittsburghfestivalopera.org</ref>\n'''Festival 2018 - July 6\u2013July 22, 2018'''\n\n*''La Boh\u00e8me Warhola'' by Giacomo Puccini\n*''Arabella'' by Richard Strauss\n*''Rhinegold'' by Richard Wagner\n*''Goldie B.
