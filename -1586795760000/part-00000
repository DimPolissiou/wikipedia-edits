Important topics they address include [[ecclesiology]], the [[sacraments]], and the role of [[bishops]].\n\n== Life ==\n{{Ignatius of Antioch}}\nNothing is known of Ignatius' life apart from what may be inferred internally from his letters, except from later (sometimes spurious) traditions.

Stevan Davies has pointed out that \"no other examples exist from the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian age]] of any prisoners except citizens or prisoners of war being brought to Rome for execution.\"<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Stevan L. |title=The Predicament of Ignatius of Antioch |journal= Vigiliae Christianae |volume= 30 |issue= 3 |year= 1976 |pages=175\u2013180 |jstor=1583332 |doi=10.1163/157007276X00249 }}</ref>\n\nIf Ignatius were a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]], he could have appealed to the emperor, but then he would usually have been beheaded rather than tortured.<ref name=\"Arnold 2017 p. 38\" /> Furthermore, the epistles of Ignatius state that he was put in chains during the journey to Rome, but it was illegal under Roman law for a citizen to be put in bonds during an appeal to the emperor.<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|175\u2013176}}\n\n[[Allen Brent]] argues that Ignatius was transferred to Rome at the request of the emperor in order to provide entertainment to the masses by being killed in the [[Colosseum]]. Brent insists, contrary to some, that \"it was normal practice to transport condemned criminals from the provinces in order to offer spectator sport in the Colosseum at Rome.\"<ref name=\"brent\">{{cite book |last=Brent |first=Allen |author-link=Allen Brent |title=Ignatius of Antioch: A Martyr Bishop and the Origin of Episcopacy |publisher=T&T Clark International |location=New York |isbn=9780567032003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iTVAwAAQBAJ |date=2007-08-23 }}</ref>{{rp|15}}\n\nStevan Davies rejects the idea that Ignatius was transported to Rome for the games at the Colosseum. He reasons that \"if Ignatius was in some way a donation by the Imperial Governor of Syria to the games at Rome, a single prisoner seems a rather miserly gift.\"<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|176}} Instead, Davies proposes that Ignatius may have been indicted by a legate, or representative, of the [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] while the governor was away temporarily, and sent to Rome for trial and execution. Under Roman law, only the governor of a province or the emperor himself could impose [[capital punishment]], so the legate would have faced the choice of imprisoning Ignatius in Antioch or sending him to Rome. Davies postulates that the legate may have decided to send Ignatius to Rome so as to minimize any further dissension among the Antiochene Christians.<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nChristine Trevett has called Davies' suggestion \"entirely hypothetical\" and concludes that no fully satisfactory solution to the problem can be found, writing, \"I tend to take the bishop at his word when he says he is a condemned man. But the question remains, why is he going to Rome? The truth is that we do not know.\"<ref name=\"trevett\">{{cite journal |last=Trevett |first=Christine |title=Ignatius 'To the Romans' and 1 Clement LIV-LVI |journal=Vigiliae Christianae |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=35\u201352 |jstor=1584438 |doi=10.1163/157007289X00173 }}</ref>\n\n=== Route of travel to Rome ===\nDuring the journey to Rome, Ignatius and his entourage of soldiers made a number of lengthy stops in [[Asia Minor]], deviating from the most direct land route from Antioch to Rome.<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|176}} Scholars generally agree on the following reconstruction of Ignatius' route of travel:\n# Ignatius first traveled from Antioch, in the province of [[Roman Syria|Syria]], to Asia Minor. It is uncertain whether he traveled by sea or by land.\n# He was then taken to [[Smyrna]], via a route that bypassed the cities of [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]], [[Tralles]], and [[Ephesus]], but likely passed through [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] (cf. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0108.htm Ign. Phil.] 7).\n# Ignatius then traveled to [[Alexandria Troas|Troas]], where he boarded a ship bound for [[Neapolis (Thrace)|Neapolis]] in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (cf. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0110.htm Ign. Pol.] 8).\n# He then passed through the city of [[Philippi]] (cf. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0136.htm Pol. Phil.] 9).\n# After this, he took some land or sea route to Rome.<ref name=\"jefford\">{{cite book |last=Jefford |first=Clayton N. |title=The Apostolic Fathers and the New Testament |year=2006 |publisher=Baker Publishing Group |location=Grand Rapids, MI |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jq4Wo3YFskUC |isbn=978-1-4412-4177-1 }}</ref>\nDuring the journey, the soldiers seem to have allowed Ignatius to meet with entire congregations of Christians while in chains, at least while he was in [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] (cf. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0108.htm Ign. Phil.] 7), and numerous Christian visitors and messengers were allowed to meet with him on a one-on-one basis. These messengers allowed Ignatius to send six letters to nearby churches, and one to [[Polycarp]], the bishop of [[Smyrna]].<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|176}}\n\nThese aspects of Ignatius' martyrdom are also regarded by scholars as unusual. It is generally expected that a prisoner would be transported on the most direct, cost-effective route to their destination. Since travel by land in the [[Roman Empire]] was between five and fifty-two times more expensive than travel by sea,<ref name=\"oxford\">{{cite web |url = https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935390.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935390-e-110 |title = Travel in the Roman World |last = Cioffi |first = Robert L. |date = 2016-03-07 |website = Oxford Handbooks Online |publisher = Oxford |access-date = 2019-07-03 |quote = Roads were by far the costliest means of transporting goods and traveling; according to calculations made by applying the ORBIS model to data from Diocletian\u2019s Edict on Maximum Prices of 301 CE, transportation by wagon cost between five and fifty-two times more than travel by boat for equivalent distances... |doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935390.013.110 }}</ref> and Antioch was a major port city, the most efficient route would likely have been entirely by sea. Steven Davies argues that Ignatius' circuitous route to Rome can only be explained by positing that he was not the main purpose of the soldiers' trip, and that the various stops in Asia Minor were for other state business. He suggests that such a scenario would also explain the relative freedom that Ignatius was given to meet with other Christians during the journey.<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|177}}\n\n=== Date of martyrdom ===\nDue to the sparse and fragmentary nature of the documentation of Ignatius' life and martyrdom, the date of his death is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty. Tradition places the martyrdom of Ignatius in the reign of [[Trajan]], who was emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. But the earliest source for this Trajanic date is the 4th century church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], who is regarded by some modern scholars as an unreliable source for chronological information regarding the early church. Eusebius had an ideological interest in dating church leaders as early as possible, and ensuring that there were no gaps in succession between the original apostles of Jesus and the leaders of the church in his day.<ref name=\"pervo\"/> Unfortunately, the epistles attributed to Ignatius provide no clear indication as to their date.\n\nWhile many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. [[Richard Pervo]] dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD.<ref name=\"pervo\"/> [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Classics|classicist]] [[Timothy Barnes]] has argued for a date in the 140s AD, on the grounds that Ignatius seems to have quoted a work of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]] in one of his epistles, who only became active in the 130s.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>\n\n=== Death and aftermath ===\nIgnatius himself wrote that he would be thrown to the beasts, and in the fourth century Eusebius reports tradition that this came to pass,<ref name=\"Eusebius 3.36\">{{ws|{{cite book |author=Eusebius |orig-year=313 |year=1890 |title=Church History of Eusebius |translator-last=McGiffert |translator-first=Arthur Cushman |editor-last1=Roberts |editor-first1=Alexander |editor-last2=Donaldson |editor-first2=James |editor-last3=Coxe |editor-first3=Arthur Cleveland |editor-last4=Schaff |editor-first4=Philip |editor-last5=Wace |editor-first5=Henry |series=[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]] |volume=Series 2, Vol. I|title-link=s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume I/Church History of Eusebius/Book III/Chapter 36 }}}}</ref> which is then repeated by [[Jerome]],<ref name=\"Arnold 2017 p. 38\" /> who is the first to explicitly mention \"lions.\" [[John Chrysostom]] is the first to allude to the [[Colosseum]] as the place of Ignatius' martyrdom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-07-08.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review: Review of ''The Apostolic Fathers: Greek Texts and English Translations''|last=Sailors|first=Timothy B.|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref> Contemporary scholars are uncertain that any of these authors had sources other than Ignatius' own writings.<ref name=\"Arnold 2017 p. 38\">{{cite book | last=Arnold | first=B.J. | title=Justification in the Second Century | publisher=De Gruyter | series=Studies of the Bible and Its Reception (SBR) | year=2017 | isbn=978-3-11-047823-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qc2DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38 | access-date=15 April 2018 | page=38}}</ref><ref name=\"Eusebius 3.36\" />\n\nAccording to a medieval Christian text titled ''Martyrium Ignatii'', Ignatius' remains were carried back to Antioch by his companions after his martyrdom.<ref name=\"ante\">[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0123.htm ''Ante-Nicene Fathers'', Vol. 1.

If there is any genuine nucleus of the ''Martyrium'', it has been so greatly expanded with interpolations that no part of it is without questions. Its most reliable manuscript is the 10th-century ''[[Codex Colbertinus]]'' (Paris), in which the ''Martyrium'' closes the collection. The ''Martyrium'' presents the confrontation of the bishop Ignatius with [[Trajan]] at Antioch, a familiar [[trope (literature)|trope]] of ''Acta'' of the martyrs, and many details of the long, partly overland voyage to Rome. The [[Synaxarium]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] says that he was thrown to the wild beasts that devoured him and rent him to pieces.<ref name=\"synaxarium\">[http://www.copticchurch.net/synaxarium/4_24.html#1 \"Synaxarium: The Martyrdom of St. Ignatius, and Patriarch of Antioch\", Coptic Orthodox Church Network]</ref>\n\n== Epistles ==\n[[File:Ignatius of Antioch.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting of Ignatius of Antioch from the [[Menologion of Basil II]] (c. 1000 AD)]]\nThe following seven epistles preserved under the name of Ignatius are generally considered authentic, since they were mentioned by the historian [[Eusebius]] in the first half of the fourth century.\n\n'''Seven original epistles:'''\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians|Epistle to the Ephesians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Epistle to the Magnesians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Epistle to the Trallians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans|Epistle to the Romans]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians|Epistle to the Philadelphians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Epistle to the Smyrnaeans]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp|Epistle to Polycarp]], a [[bishop]] of [[Smyrna]].\n\n=== Recensions ===\nThe text of these epistles is known in three different [[recension]]s, or editions: the Short Recension, found in a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[manuscript]]; the Middle Recension, found in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] manuscripts; and the Long Recension, found in [[Latin]] manuscripts.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|120\u2013121}}\n\nFor some time, it was believed that the Long Recension was the only extant version of the Ignatian epistles, but around 1628 a Latin translation of the Middle Recension was discovered by [[Archbishop]] [[James Ussher]], who published it in 1646. For around a quarter of a century after this, it was debated which recension represented the original text of the epistles. But ever since [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]]'s strong defense of the authenticity of the Middle Recension in the late 17th century, there has been a scholarly consensus that the Middle Recension is the original version of the text.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|121}} The Long Recension is the product of a fourth-century [[Arianism|Arian]] Christian, who [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolated]] the Middle Recension epistles in order to posthumously enlist Ignatius as an unwitting witness in theological disputes of that age. This individual also forged the six spurious epistles attributed to Ignatius (see {{section link||Pseudo-Ignatius}} below).<ref name=\"trobisch-2007\">{{cite journal |last=Trobisch |first=David |author-link=David Trobisch |title=Who Published the New Testament? |journal=Free Inquiry |publisher=Council for Secular Humanism |location=Amherst, NY |volume=28 |issue=Dec. 2007/Jan. 2008 |pages=30\u201333 |url=http://trobisch.com/david/wb/media/articles/20071226%20FreeInquiry%20Who%20Published%20Christian%20Bible%20BW.pdf }}</ref>\n\nManuscripts representing the Short Recension of the Ignatian epistles were discovered and published by [[William Cureton]] in the mid-19th century. For a brief period, there was a scholarly debate on the question of whether the Short Recension was earlier and more original than the Middle Recension. But by the end of the 19th century, [[Theodor Zahn]] and [[J. B. Lightfoot]] had established a scholarly consensus that the Short Recension is merely a summary of the text of the Middle Recension, and was therefore composed later.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\n=== Authenticity ===\nEver since the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, the authenticity of all the Ignatian epistles has come under intense scrutiny. [[John Calvin]] called the epistles \"rubbish published under Ignatius\u2019 name.\"<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|119}} However, he was not referring to the epistles discussed in this article which are now believed to be genuine, which were not rediscovered until the 17th century. The \"letters of Ignatius\" known during the Reformation are now generally agreed to be forgeries.  Some Protestants have tended to want to deny the authenticity of all the epistles attributed to Ignatius because they seem to attest to the existence of a [[Bishop|monarchical episcopate]] in the second century.\n\nIn 1886, [[Presbyterian]] minister and church historian [[William Dool Killen]] published an essay extensively arguing that none of the epistles attributed to Ignatius is authentic. Instead, he argued that [[Pope Callixtus I|Callixtus]], bishop of Rome, [[Pseudepigrapha|forged]] the letters around AD 220 to garner support for a [[Apostolic succession|monarchical episcopate]], modeling the renowned Saint Ignatius after his own life to give precedent for his own authority.<ref name=\"Killen 1886\">{{citation |last=Killen |first=William Dool |year=1886 |title=The Ignatian epistles entirely spurious: A reply to the Right Rev.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, the scholars Robert Joly, Reinhard H\u00fcbner, [[Markus Vinzent]], and Thomas Lenchner argued forcefully that the epistles of the Middle Recension were forgeries written during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-180 AD). Around the same time, the scholar Joseph Ruis-Camps published a study arguing that the Middle Recension letters were [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphically]] composed based on an original, smaller, authentic corpus of four letters ([[Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans|Romans]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians|Ephesians]]).

Ignatius modeled his writings after Paul, Peter, and John, and even quoted or paraphrased their own works freely, such as when he quoted 1 Corinthians 1:18, in his letter to the Ephesians:\n{{quote|Let my spirit be counted as nothing for the sake of the cross, which is a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal.|''Letter to the Ephesians'' 18, Roberts and Donaldson translation<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/ignatius-of-antioch |title=''A Pinch on Incense'', (Ted Byfield, ed.), p. 50 |access-date=2013-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226135352/http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/ignatius-of-antioch/ |archive-date=2012-12-26 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>}}\n\n== Theology ==\n=== Christology ===\nIgnatius is known to have taught the deity of Christ: {{quote|There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death; both of Mary and of God; first passible and then impassible, even Jesus Christ our Lord.|source=''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch. 7, shorter version, Roberts-Donaldson translation}}\nThe same section in text of the Long Recension says the following:\n\n{{quote|But our Physician is the Only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For \"the Word was made flesh.\" Being incorporeal, He was in the body, being impassible, He was in a passible body, being immortal, He was in a mortal body, being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.|source=''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch. 7, longer version}}\n\nHe stressed the value of the [[Eucharist]], calling it a \"medicine of immortality\" (''Ignatius to the Ephesians'' 20:2). The very strong desire for bloody martyrdom in the arena, which Ignatius expresses rather graphically in places, may seem quite odd to the modern reader. An examination of his theology of [[soteriology]] shows that he regarded salvation as one being free from the powerful fear of death and thus to bravely face martyrdom.<ref>Cobb, L. Stephanie. ''Dying To Be Men: Gender and Language in Early Christian Martyr Texts'', page 3 (Columbia University Press, 2008); {{ISBN|978-0-231-14498-8}}</ref>\n\nIgnatius is claimed to be the first known Christian writer to argue in favor of Christianity's replacement of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] with the [[Lord's Day]]:\n\n{{quote|Be not seduced by strange doctrines nor by antiquated fables, which are profitless. For if even unto this day we live after the manner of Judaism, we avow that we have not received grace ... If then those who had walked in ancient practices attained unto newness of hope, no longer observing Sabbaths but fashioning their lives after the Lord's day, on which our life also arose through Him ... how shall we be able to live apart from Him?|source=''Ignatius to the Magnesians'' 8:1, 9:1-2, [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|Lightfoot]] translation.}}\n\n{{quote|Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness, ... But let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body ... and not eating things prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed space ... And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord's day as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days [of the week]. Looking forward to this, the prophet declared, \"To the end, for the eighth day,\" on which our life both sprang up again, and the victory over death was obtained in Christ|source=''[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Epistle to the Magnesians|Letter to the Magnesians]]'' 9, Roberts and Donaldson translation, p. 189.}}\n\n=== [[Ecclesiology]] ===\nIgnatius is the earliest known Christian writer to emphasize [[loyalty]] to a single [[bishop]] in each city (or [[diocese]]) who is assisted by both [[presbyter]]s (elders) and [[deacon]]s. Earlier writings only mention ''either'' bishops ''or'' presbyters.\n\nFor instance, his writings on bishops, presbyters and deacons:\n\n{{quote|Take care to do all things in harmony with God, with the bishop presiding in the place of God, and with the presbyters in the place of the council of the apostles, and with the deacons, who are most dear to me, entrusted with the business of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father from the beginning and is at last made manifest|source=''Letter to the Magnesians 2'', 6:1}}\n\nHe is also responsible for the first known use of the Greek word ''katholikos'' (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"universal\", \"complete\" and \"whole\" to describe the church, writing:\n\n{{quote|Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be; as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.  It is not lawful to baptize or give communion without the consent of the bishop. On the other hand, whatever has his approval is pleasing to God. Thus, whatever is done will be safe and valid.|source=''Letter to the Smyrnaeans'' 8, J.R. Willis translation.}}\n\nIt is from the word ''katholikos'' (\"according to the whole\") that the word ''[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]'' comes. When Ignatius wrote the Letter to the Smyrnaeans in about the year 107 and used the word ''catholic'', he used it as if it were a word already in use to describe the Church. This has led many scholars to conclude that the appellation ''Catholic Church'' with its ecclesial connotation may have been in use as early as the last quarter of the First century. On the [[Eucharist]], he wrote in his letter to the Smyrnaeans:\n\n{{quote|Take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ which has come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God ... They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, flesh which suffered for our sins and which that Father, in his goodness, raised up again. They who deny the gift of God are perishing in their disputes.|source=''Letter to the Smyrnaeans'' 6:2\u20137:1}}\n\nIn his letter addressed to the Christians of Rome, he entreats to do nothing to prevent his martyrdom.<ref name=crawley />\n\n== Parallels with Peregrinus Proteus ==\nSeveral scholars have noted that there are striking similarities between Ignatius and the [[Christians|Christian]]-turned-[[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher [[Peregrinus Proteus]],<ref name=\"brent\"/><ref name=\"schoedel\">{{cite book |last=Schoedel |first=William R. |title=A Commentary on the Letters of Ignatius of Antioch |page=279 |editor1-last=Koester |editor1-first=Helmut |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Philadelphia |year=1985 |isbn=0-8006-6016-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnZmngEACAAJ }}</ref> as described in [[Lucian]]'s famous satire ''[[Passing of Peregrinus|The Passing of Peregrinus]]'':\n* Both Ignatius and Peregrinus show a morbid eagerness to die.\n* Both characters are, or have been, Christians.\n* Both are imprisoned by Roman authorities.\n* Upon the arrest of both prisoners, Christians from all over Asia Minor come to visit them and bring them gifts (cf.

Stevan Davies has pointed out that \"no other examples exist from the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian age]] of any prisoners except citizens or prisoners of war being brought to Rome for execution.\"<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Stevan L. |title=The Predicament of Ignatius of Antioch |journal= Vigiliae Christianae |volume= 30 |issue= 3 |year= 1976 |pages=175\u2013180 |jstor=1583332 |doi=10.1163/157007276X00249 }}</ref>\n\nIf Ignatius were a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]], he could have appealed to the emperor, but then he would usually have been beheaded rather than tortured.<ref name=\"Arnold 2017 p. 38\" /> Furthermore, the epistles of Ignatius state that he was put in chains during the journey to Rome, but it was illegal under Roman law for a citizen to be put in bonds during an appeal to the emperor.<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|175\u2013176}}\n\n[[Allen Brent]] argues that Ignatius was transferred to Rome at the request of the emperor in order to provide entertainment to the masses by being killed in the [[Colosseum]].

He reasons that \"if Ignatius was in some way a donation by the Imperial Governor of Syria to the games at Rome, a single prisoner seems a rather miserly gift.\"<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|176}} Instead, Davies proposes that Ignatius may have been indicted by a legate, or representative, of the [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] while the governor was away temporarily, and sent to Rome for trial and execution. Under Roman law, only the governor of a province or the emperor himself could impose [[capital punishment]], so the legate would have faced the choice of imprisoning Ignatius in Antioch or sending him to Rome.

It is uncertain whether he traveled by sea or by land.\n# He was then taken to [[Smyrna]], via a route that bypassed the cities of [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]], [[Tralles]], and [[Ephesus]], but likely passed through [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]] (cf. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0108.htm Ign.

These messengers allowed Ignatius to send six letters to nearby churches, and one to [[Polycarp]], the bishop of [[Smyrna]].<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|176}}\n\nThese aspects of Ignatius' martyrdom are also regarded by scholars as unusual. It is generally expected that a prisoner would be transported on the most direct, cost-effective route to their destination. Since travel by land in the [[Roman Empire]] was between five and fifty-two times more expensive than travel by sea,<ref name=\"oxford\">{{cite web |url = https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935390.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935390-e-110 |title = Travel in the Roman World |last = Cioffi |first = Robert L. |date = 2016-03-07 |website = Oxford Handbooks Online |publisher = Oxford |access-date = 2019-07-03 |quote = Roads were by far the costliest means of transporting goods and traveling; according to calculations made by applying the ORBIS model to data from Diocletian\u2019s Edict on Maximum Prices of 301 CE, transportation by wagon cost between five and fifty-two times more than travel by boat for equivalent distances... |doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935390.013.110 }}</ref> and Antioch was a major port city, the most efficient route would likely have been entirely by sea. Steven Davies argues that Ignatius' circuitous route to Rome can only be explained by positing that he was not the main purpose of the soldiers' trip, and that the various stops in Asia Minor were for other state business. He suggests that such a scenario would also explain the relative freedom that Ignatius was given to meet with other Christians during the journey.<ref name=\"davies\"/>{{rp|177}}\n\n=== Date of martyrdom ===\nDue to the sparse and fragmentary nature of the documentation of Ignatius' life and martyrdom, the date of his death is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty. Tradition places the martyrdom of Ignatius in the reign of [[Trajan]], who was emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. But the earliest source for this Trajanic date is the 4th century church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], who is regarded by some modern scholars as an unreliable source for chronological information regarding the early church. Eusebius had an ideological interest in dating church leaders as early as possible, and ensuring that there were no gaps in succession between the original apostles of Jesus and the leaders of the church in his day.<ref name=\"pervo\"/> Unfortunately, the epistles attributed to Ignatius provide no clear indication as to their date.\n\nWhile many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. [[Richard Pervo]] dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD.<ref name=\"pervo\"/> [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Classics|classicist]] [[Timothy Barnes]] has argued for a date in the 140s AD, on the grounds that Ignatius seems to have quoted a work of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]] in one of his epistles, who only became active in the 130s.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>\n\n=== Death and aftermath ===\nIgnatius himself wrote that he would be thrown to the beasts, and in the fourth century Eusebius reports tradition that this came to pass,<ref name=\"Eusebius 3.36\">{{ws|{{cite book |author=Eusebius |orig-year=313 |year=1890 |title=Church History of Eusebius |translator-last=McGiffert |translator-first=Arthur Cushman |editor-last1=Roberts |editor-first1=Alexander |editor-last2=Donaldson |editor-first2=James |editor-last3=Coxe |editor-first3=Arthur Cleveland |editor-last4=Schaff |editor-first4=Philip |editor-last5=Wace |editor-first5=Henry |series=[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]] |volume=Series 2, Vol. I|title-link=s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume I/Church History of Eusebius/Book III/Chapter 36 }}}}</ref> which is then repeated by [[Jerome]],<ref name=\"Arnold 2017 p. 38\" /> who is the first to explicitly mention \"lions.\" [[John Chrysostom]] is the first to allude to the [[Colosseum]] as the place of Ignatius' martyrdom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-07-08.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review: Review of ''The Apostolic Fathers: Greek Texts and English Translations''|last=Sailors|first=Timothy B.|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref> Contemporary scholars are uncertain that any of these authors had sources other than Ignatius' own writings.<ref name=\"Arnold 2017 p. 38\">{{cite book | last=Arnold | first=B.J. | title=Justification in the Second Century | publisher=De Gruyter | series=Studies of the Bible and Its Reception (SBR) | year=2017 | isbn=978-3-11-047823-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qc2DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38 | access-date=15 April 2018 | page=38}}</ref><ref name=\"Eusebius 3.36\" />\n\nAccording to a medieval Christian text titled ''Martyrium Ignatii'', Ignatius' remains were carried back to Antioch by his companions after his martyrdom.<ref name=\"ante\">[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0123.htm ''Ante-Nicene Fathers'', Vol. 1.

Its most reliable manuscript is the 10th-century ''[[Codex Colbertinus]]'' (Paris), in which the ''Martyrium'' closes the collection. The ''Martyrium'' presents the confrontation of the bishop Ignatius with [[Trajan]] at Antioch, a familiar [[trope (literature)|trope]] of ''Acta'' of the martyrs, and many details of the long, partly overland voyage to Rome. The [[Synaxarium]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] says that he was thrown to the wild beasts that devoured him and rent him to pieces.<ref name=\"synaxarium\">[http://www.copticchurch.net/synaxarium/4_24.html#1 \"Synaxarium: The Martyrdom of St. Ignatius, and Patriarch of Antioch\", Coptic Orthodox Church Network]</ref>\n\n== Epistles ==\n[[File:Ignatius of Antioch.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting of Ignatius of Antioch from the [[Menologion of Basil II]] (c. 1000 AD)]]\nThe following seven epistles preserved under the name of Ignatius are generally considered authentic, since they were mentioned by the historian [[Eusebius]] in the first half of the fourth century.\n\n'''Seven original epistles:'''\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians|Epistle to the Ephesians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Epistle to the Magnesians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Epistle to the Trallians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans|Epistle to the Romans]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians|Epistle to the Philadelphians]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Epistle to the Smyrnaeans]],\n* The [[Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp|Epistle to Polycarp]], a [[bishop]] of [[Smyrna]].\n\n=== Recensions ===\nThe text of these epistles is known in three different [[recension]]s, or editions: the Short Recension, found in a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[manuscript]]; the Middle Recension, found in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] manuscripts; and the Long Recension, found in [[Latin]] manuscripts.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|120\u2013121}}\n\nFor some time, it was believed that the Long Recension was the only extant version of the Ignatian epistles, but around 1628 a Latin translation of the Middle Recension was discovered by [[Archbishop]] [[James Ussher]], who published it in 1646. For around a quarter of a century after this, it was debated which recension represented the original text of the epistles. But ever since [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]]'s strong defense of the authenticity of the Middle Recension in the late 17th century, there has been a scholarly consensus that the Middle Recension is the original version of the text.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|121}} The Long Recension is the product of a fourth-century [[Arianism|Arian]] Christian, who [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolated]] the Middle Recension epistles in order to posthumously enlist Ignatius as an unwitting witness in theological disputes of that age.

For a brief period, there was a scholarly debate on the question of whether the Short Recension was earlier and more original than the Middle Recension. But by the end of the 19th century, [[Theodor Zahn]] and [[J. B. Lightfoot]] had established a scholarly consensus that the Short Recension is merely a summary of the text of the Middle Recension, and was therefore composed later.<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\n=== Authenticity ===\nEver since the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, the authenticity of all the Ignatian epistles has come under intense scrutiny. [[John Calvin]] called the epistles \"rubbish published under Ignatius\u2019 name.\"<ref name=\"date of ignatius\"/>{{rp|119}} However, he was not referring to the epistles discussed in this article which are now believed to be genuine, which were not rediscovered until the 17th century. The \"letters of Ignatius\" known during the Reformation are now generally agreed to be be forgeries.  Some Protestants have tended to want to deny the authenticity of all the epistles attributed to Ignatius because they seem to attest to the existence of a [[Bishop|monarchical episcopate]] in the second century.\n\nIn 1886, [[Presbyterian]] minister and church historian [[William Dool Killen]] published an essay extensively arguing that none of the epistles attributed to Ignatius is authentic. Instead, he argued that [[Pope Callixtus I|Callixtus]], bishop of Rome, [[Pseudepigrapha|forged]] the letters around AD 220 to garner support for a [[Apostolic succession|monarchical episcopate]], modeling the renowned Saint Ignatius after his own life to give precedent for his own authority.<ref name=\"Killen 1886\">{{citation |last=Killen |first=William Dool |year=1886 |title=The Ignatian epistles entirely spurious: A reply to the Right Rev.

Around the same time, the scholar Joseph Ruis-Camps published a study arguing that the Middle Recension letters were [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphically]] composed based on an original, smaller, authentic corpus of four letters ([[Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans|Romans]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians|Ephesians]]).

Ignatius modeled his writings after Paul, Peter, and John, and even quoted or paraphrased their own works freely, such as when he quoted 1 Corinthians 1:18, in his letter to the Ephesians:\n{{quote|Let my spirit be counted as nothing for the sake of the cross, which is a stumbling-block to those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal.|''Letter to the Ephesians'' 18, Roberts and Donaldson translation<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/ignatius-of-antioch |title=''A Pinch on Incense'', (Ted Byfield, ed.), p. 50 |access-date=2013-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226135352/http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/ignatius-of-antioch/ |archive-date=2012-12-26 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>}}\n\n== Theology ==\n=== Christology ===\nIgnatius is known to have taught the deity of Christ: {{quote|There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death; both of Mary and of God; first passible and then impassible, even Jesus Christ our Lord.|source=''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch. 7, shorter version, Roberts-Donaldson translation}}\nThe same section in text of the Long Recension says the following:\n\n{{quote|But our Physician is the Only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For \"the Word was made flesh.\" Being incorporeal, He was in the body, being impassible, He was in a passible body, being immortal, He was in a mortal body, being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.|source=''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch. 7, longer version}}\n\nHe stressed the value of the [[Eucharist]], calling it a \"medicine of immortality\" (''Ignatius to the Ephesians'' 20:2). The very strong desire for bloody martyrdom in the arena, which Ignatius expresses rather graphically in places, may seem quite odd to the modern reader. An examination of his theology of [[soteriology]] shows that he regarded salvation as one being free from the powerful fear of death and thus to bravely face martyrdom.<ref>Cobb, L. Stephanie.

And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord's day as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days [of the week].

Earlier writings only mention ''either'' bishops ''or'' presbyters.\n\nFor instance, his writings on bishops, presbyters and deacons:\n\n{{quote|Take care to do all things in harmony with God, with the bishop presiding in the place of God, and with the presbyters in the place of the council of the apostles, and with the deacons, who are most dear to me, entrusted with the business of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father from the beginning and is at last made manifest|source=''Letter to the Magnesians 2'', 6:1}}\n\nHe is also responsible for the first known use of the Greek word ''katholikos'' (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"universal\", \"complete\" and \"whole\" to describe the church, writing:\n\n{{quote|Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be; as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.  It is not lawful to baptize or give communion without the consent of the bishop. On the other hand, whatever has his approval is pleasing to God. Thus, whatever is done will be safe and valid.|source=''Letter to the Smyrnaeans'' 8, J.R. Willis translation.}}\n\nIt is from the word ''katholikos'' (\"according to the whole\") that the word ''[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]'' comes. When Ignatius wrote the Letter to the Smyrnaeans in about the year 107 and used the word ''catholic'', he used it as if it were a word already in use to describe the Church. This has led many scholars to conclude that the appellation ''Catholic Church'' with its ecclesial connotation may have been in use as early as the last quarter of the First century. On the [[Eucharist]], he wrote in his letter to the Smyrnaeans:\n\n{{quote|Take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ which has come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God ...

This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> \n\nConway was probably the most important member of [[Martin Gardner#Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine|Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Dan did the self-titled debut cd.\n\n==Biography==\nSantiago Dobles was born in Caracas, Venezuela. He started playing guitar at age 11.<ref>http://www.conklinguitars.com/artists_santiago_dobles.html</ref> As a teenager, he studied under Jae Valentine and Robin Stone.<ref>http://www.conklinguitars.com/artists_santiago_dobles.html</ref> At age 18 he attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], majoring in composition, film scoring and guitar. While at Berklee, he studied fusion guitar under the guidance of Jon Finn, Mark White, Mashi Hasu, & Bruce Bartlett. Outside of Berklee, he studied guitar with Paul Masvidal (of [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]] fame), Paul Aldanee and through correspondence with [[Derek Taylor]] (Shrapnel recording artist) and Derryl Gabel. He also studied sound engineering at Miami Dade Community College.

{"title_page": "Roman infantry tactics", "text_new": "{{RomanMilitary}}\n'''Roman infantry tactics''' refers to the theoretical and historical deployment, formation, and manoeuvres of the [[Roman army|Roman]] infantry from the start of the [[Roman Republic]] to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]].\n\nThe focus below is primarily on Roman tactics \u2013 the \"how\" of their approach to battle, and how it stacked up against a variety of opponents over time. It does not attempt detailed coverage of things like army structure or equipment. Various battles are summarized to illustrate Roman methods with links to detailed articles on individual encounters. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Evolution==\nRoman [[military tactics]] and [[strategy]] evolved from that type of a small tribal host-seeking local hegemony to massive operations encompassing a world [[empire]]. This advance was affected by changing trends in Roman political, social and economic life, and that of the larger Mediterranean world, but it was also undergirded by a distinctive \"Roman way\" of war. This approach included a tendency towards standardization and systematization, practical borrowing, copying and adapting from outsiders, flexibility in tactics and methods, a strong sense of discipline, a ruthless persistence that sought comprehensive victory, and a cohesion brought about by the idea of [[Roman citizenship]] under arms \u2013 embodied in the [[Roman legion|legion]].<ref>John Warry, ''Warfare in the Ancient World'', (St. Martin's, 1980), pp. 70\u2013193</ref> These elements waxed and waned over time, but they form a distinct basis underlying Rome's rise.\n\nSome key phases of this [[evolution]] throughout Rome's [[military]] history include:<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003 pp. 18\u2013117</ref>\n\n* Military forces based primarily on heavy citizen infantry with tribal beginnings and early use of phalanx-type elements (see [[Military establishment of the Roman kingdom]])\n* Growing sophistication as Roman hegemony expanded outside Italy into North Africa, Greece and the Middle East (see [[Military establishment of the Roman Republic]])\n* Continued refinement, standardization and streamlining in the period associated with [[Gaius Marius]] including broader-based incorporation of more citizenry into the army, and more professionalism and permanence in army service\n* Continued expansion, flexibility and sophistication from the end of the [[republic]] into the time of the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] (see [[Military establishment of the Roman Empire]])\n* Growing barbarization, turmoil and weakening of the heavy infantry units in favour of [[cavalry]] and lighter troops (see ''[[Foederati]]'')\n* Demise of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] and fragmentation into smaller, weaker local forces. This included the reversal of status of cavalry and infantry in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]]. ''[[Cataphract]]'' forces formed an elite, with infantry being reduced to auxiliaries.\n\n==Manpower==\nNumerous scholarly histories of the Roman military machine note the huge numbers of men that could be mobilized, more than any other Mediterranean power. This bounty of military resources enabled Rome to apply crushing pressure to its enemies, and stay in the field and replace losses, even after suffering setbacks. One historian of the Second Punic War states:\n\n{{quote|According to Polybius (2.24), the total number of Roman and allied men capable of bearing arms in 225&nbsp;BC exceeded 700,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalries. Brunt adjusted Polybius\u2019 figures and estimated that the population of Italy, not including Greeks and Bruttians, exceeded 875,000 free adult males, from whom the Romans could levy troops. Rome not only had the potential to levy vast numbers of troops but did in fact field large armies in the opening stages of the war. Brunt estimates that Rome mobilized 108,000 men for service in the legions between 218&nbsp;BC and 215&nbsp;BC, while at the height of the war effort (214&nbsp;BC to 212&nbsp;BC) [against Hannibal] Rome was able to mobilize approximately 230,000 men. Against these mighty resources Hannibal led from Spain an army of approximately 50,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry&nbsp;... Rome's manpower reserves allowed it to absorb staggering losses yet still continue to field large armies. For example, according to Brunt, as many as 50,000 men were lost between 218&nbsp;BC and 215&nbsp;BC, but Rome continued to place between 14 and 25 legions in the field for the duration of the war. Moreover, as will be discussed below, Roman manpower allowed for the adoption of the so-called \"Fabian strategy\", which proved to be an effective response to Hannibal's apparent battlefield superiority. Put simply, the relative disparity in the number of available troops at the outset of the conflict meant that Hannibal had a much narrower margin for error than the Romans.<ref>Michael Fronda (2010). ''Between Rome and Carthage: Southern Italy during the Second Punic War''. p. 38</ref>}}\n\n==Equipment and training==\n{{further|Roman military personal equipment|Roman legion}}\n\n===Equipment===\n\n====Individual weapons, personal equipment and haulage====\nA legionary typically carried around 27 kilograms (60 pounds) of armour, weapons, and equipment. This load consisted of armour, a sword, called a ''[[gladius]]'', a shield, two ''[[Pilum|pila]]'' (one heavy, one light) and 15 days' food rations. There were also tools for digging and constructing a ''[[castra]]'', the legions' fortified base camp. One writer recreates the following as to Caesar's army in Gaul:<ref>Colleen McCullough, (2003) Caesar, p 303-417</ref> Each soldier arranged his heavy pack on a T or Y-shaped rod, borne on his left shoulder. Shields were protected on the march with a hide cover. Each legionary carried about 5 days' worth of wheat, pulses or chickpeas, a flask of oil, and a mess kit with a dish, cup, and utensil. Personal items might include a dyed horsehair crest for the helmet, a semi-water-resistant oiled woollen cloak, socks and breeches for cold weather and a blanket. Entrenchment equipment included a shallow wicker basket for moving earth, a spade and/or pick-axe like ''[[dolabra]]'' or turf cutter, and two wooden staves to construct the next camp palisade. All these were arranged in the marching pack toted by each infantryman.\n\nFighters travelled in groups of eight, and each octet was sometimes assigned a mule. The mule carried a variety of equipment and supplies, including a mill for grinding grain, a small clay oven for baking bread, cooking pots, spare weapons, waterskins, and tents. A Roman century had a complement of 10 mules, each attended by two non-combatants who handled foraging and water supply. A century might be supported by wagons in the rear, each drawn by six mules, and carrying tools, nails, water barrels, extra food and the tent and possessions of the centurion- commanding officer of the unit.\n\n====Artillery package====\nThe legion also carried an artillery detachment with 30 pieces of artillery. This consisted of 10 stone-throwing [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]]s and 20 bolt-shooting [[ballista]]s; in addition, each of the legion's centuries had its own [[Scorpio (weapon)|scorpio]] bolt thrower (60 total), together with supporting wagons to carry ammunition and spare parts. Bolts were used for targeted fire on human opponents, while stones were used against fortifications or as an area saturation weapon. The catapults were powered by rope and sinew, tightened by a ratchet and released, powered by the stored torsion energy. Caesar was to mount these in boats on some operations in Britain, striking fear in the heart of the native opponents according to his writings. His placement of siege engines and bolt throwers in the towers and along the wall of his enclosing fortifications at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] were critical to turning back the enormous tide of Gauls. These defensive measures, used in concert with the cavalry charge led by Caesar himself, broke the Gauls and won the battle\u2014and therefore the war\u2014for good. Bolt-throwers like the Scorpio were mobile and could be deployed in defence of camps, field entrenchments and even in the open field by no more than two or three men.<ref>Rome at war. (2005) Gilliver et al. Osprey, p 63\u201397</ref>\n\n===Training===\n\nOver time the military system changed its equipment and roles, but throughout the course of Roman history, it always remained a disciplined and professional war machine. Soldiers carried out training common to every organized army, from initial muster, arms and weapons drill, formation marching and tactical exercises.\n\nAccording to [[Vegetius]], during the four-month initial training of a Roman legionary, marching skills were taught before recruits ever handled a weapon, since any formation would be split up by stragglers at the back or soldiers trundling along at differing speeds.<ref name=\"roman-empire.net\">http://www.roman-empire.net/army/training.html</ref> Standards varied over time, but normally recruits were first required to complete 20 Roman miles (29.62&nbsp;km or 18.405 modern miles) with 20.5&nbsp;kg in five summer hours (the Roman day was divided into 12 hours regardless of season, as was the night), which was known as \"the regular step\" or \"military pace\".<ref name=\"therthdimension.org\">http://www.therthdimension.org/AncientRome/Roman_Army/Training/training.htm</ref> They then progressed to the \"faster step\" or \"full pace\"<ref name=\"therthdimension.org\"/> and were required to complete 24 Roman miles (35.544&nbsp;km or 22.086 modern miles) in five summer hours loaded with 20.5 kilograms (45&nbsp;lb). The typical conditioning regime also included gymnastics and swimming to build physical strength and fitness.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Complete Roman Army'', Thames & Hudson, 2003, pp. 72\u2013186</ref>\n\nAfter conditioning, the recruits underwent weapons training; this was deemed of such importance that weapons instructors generally received double rations.<ref name=\"roman-empire.net\"/> Legionaries were trained to thrust with their ''gladii'' because they could defend themselves behind their large shields (''[[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]'') while stabbing the enemy. These training exercises began with thrusting a wooden ''[[gladius]]'' and throwing wooden ''[[pilum|pila]]'' into a [[quintain (jousting)|quintain]] (wooden dummy or stake) while wearing full [[Roman armor|armor]]. Their wooden swords and ''pila'' were designed to be twice as heavy as their metal counterparts so that the soldiers could wield a true ''gladius'' with ease. Next, soldiers progressed to ''armatura'', a term for sparring that was also used to describe the similar one-on-one training of [[gladiator]]s. Unlike earlier training, the wooden weapons used for ''armatura'' were the same weight as the weapons they emulated. Vegetius notes that roofed halls were built to allow for these drills to continue throughout the winter.<ref name=\"roman-empire.net\"/>\n\nOther training exercises taught the legionary to obey commands and assume battle formations.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\">Goldsworthy, ''The Complete Roman Army'', op. cit.</ref> At the end of training the legionary had to swear an oath of loyalty to the [[SPQR]] ({{lang|la|Senatus Populusque Romanus}}, the senate and the Roman people) or later to the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]]. The soldier was then given a [[Military diploma|diploma]] and sent off to fight for his living and the glory and honour of Rome.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\" />\n\n==Organization, leadership and logistics==\n\n===Command, control and structure===\n\nOnce the soldier had finished his training he was typically assigned to a [[Roman legion|legion]], the basic mass fighting force. The legion was split into ten sub-units called [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], roughly comparable to a modern infantry battalion. The cohorts were further sub-divided into three ''[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]'', which in turn were split into two [[Centuria|centuries]] of about 80\u2013100 men each. The first cohort in a legion was usually the strongest, with the fullest personnel complement and with the most skilled, experienced men. Several legions grouped together made up a distinctive field force or \"army\".<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\" /> Fighting strength could vary but generally a legion was made up of 4,800 soldiers, 60 centurions, 300 artillerymen, and 100 engineers and artificers, and 1,200 non-combatants. Each legion was supported by a unit of 300 cavalries, the ''equites''.\n\nSupreme command of either legion or army was by [[Roman consul|consul]] or [[proconsul]] or a ''[[praetor]]'', or in cases of emergency in the republican era, a [[Roman Dictator|dictator]]. A ''[[praetor]]'' or a ''[[propraetor]]'' could only command a single legion and not a consular army, which normally consisted of two legions plus the allies. In the early republican period, it was customary for an army to have dual commands, with different consuls holding the office on alternate days. In later centuries this was phased out in favour of one overall army commander. The ''[[Legatus|legati]]'' were officers of senatorial rank who assisted the supreme commander. [[Tribunes]] were young men of aristocratic rank who often supervised administrative tasks like camp construction. [[Centurion (Roman army)|Centurions]] (roughly equivalent in rank to today's non-commissioned or junior officers, but functioning as modern captains in field operations) commanded cohorts, ''maniples'' and centuries. Specialist groups like [[engineers]] and artificers were also used.\n\n====Military structure and ranks====\nFor an in-depth analysis of ranks, types, and historical units, see [[Structural history of the Roman military]] and [[Roman legion]] for a detailed breakdown. Below is a very basic summary of the legion's structure and ranks.<ref>Albert Harkness, ''The Military System of the Romans'', University Press of the Pacific, 2004, pp. 53\u201389</ref>\n\n=====Force structure=====\n* ''Contubernium'': \"tent unit\" of eight men\n* ''Centuria'': 80 men commanded by a centurion\n* Cohort: six centuries or a total of 480 fighting men. Added to these were officers. The first cohort was double strength in terms of manpower and generally held the best fighting men.\n* Legion: made up of 10 cohorts\n* Field army: a grouping of several legions and auxiliary cohorts\n* ''Equites'': Each legion was supported by 300 cavalry (''equites''), sub-divided into ten ''turmae''\n* ''Auxilia'' and ''velites'': allied contingents, often providing light infantry and specialist fighting services, like archers, slingers or javelin-men. They were usually formed into the light infantry or ''velites''. ''Auxilia'' in the republican period also formed allied heavy legions to complement Roman citizen formations.\n* Non-combatant support: generally the men who tended the mules, forage, watering and sundries of the baggage train\n* 4,500\u20135,200 men in a legion\n\n=====Rank summary=====\n*Consul \u2013 an elected official with military and civic duties; like a co-president (there were two), but also a major military commander\n*''Praetor'' \u2013 appointed military commander of a legion or grouping of legions, also a government official\n*''[[Legatus legionis]]'' \u2013 the legate or overall legion commander, usually filled by a senator\n*Tribune \u2013 young officer, second in command of the legion. Other lesser tribunes served as junior officers.\n*Prefect \u2013 third in command of the legion. There were various types. The ''prefectus equitarius'' commanded a unit of cavalry\n*''Primus pilus'' \u2013 commanding centurion for the first cohort \u2013 the senior centurion of the entire legion\n*Centurion \u2013 basic commander of the century.

Heavy equipment and material (tents, [[artillery]], extra weapons and equipment, millstones etc.) were moved by pack animal and cart, while troops carried weighty individual packs with them, including staves and shovels for constructing the fortified camps. Typical of all armies, local opportunities were also exploited by troops on the spot, and the fields of peasant farmers who were near the zone of conflict might be stripped to meet army needs. As with most armed forces, a variety of traders, hucksters, [[prostitute]]s and other [[Train (military)|miscellaneous service providers]] trailed in the wake of the Roman fighting men.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Initial preparations and movement for battle===\n\n'''The approach march.''' Once the legion was deployed on an operation, the marching began. The approach to the battlefield was made in several columns, enhancing manoeuvrability. Typically a strong vanguard preceded the main body and included scouts, cavalry and light troops. A tribune or other officer often accompanied the vanguard to survey the terrain for possible camp locations. Flank and reconnaissance elements were also deployed to provide the usual covering security. Behind the vanguard came the main body of heavy infantry. Each legion marched as a distinct formation and was accompanied by its own baggage train. The last legion usually provided the rear force, although several recently raised units might occupy this final echelon.\n\n'''Construction of fortified camps.''' Legions on a campaign typically established a strong field camp, complete with [[palisade]] and a deep ditch, providing a basis for supply storage, troop marshalling and defence. Camps were recreated each time the army moved and were constructed with a view to both military necessity and religious symbolism. There were always four gateways, connected by two main crisscrossing streets, with the intersection at a concentration of command tents in the centre. Space was also made for an altar and religious gathering area. Everything was standardized, from the positioning of baggage, equipment and specific army units, to the duties of officers who were to set up sentries, pickets and orders for the next day's march. Construction could take between 2 and 5 hours with part of the army labouring, while the rest stood guard, depending on the tactical situation. The shape of the camp was generally rectangular but could vary based on the terrain or tactical situation. A distance of about 60 meters was left clear between the entrenchments and the first row of troop tents. This gap provided space for marshalling the legionnaires for battle and kept the troop area out of enemy missile range.<ref>Pierre Grimal, ''The Civilization of Rome'', op. cit</ref> No other ancient army persisted over such a long period in systematic camp construction like the Romans, even if the army rested for only a single day.<ref>John Warry, ''Warfare in the ancient World'', (St. Martin's, 1980), pp. 70-183</ref>\n\n'''Breaking camp and marching'''. After a regimented breakfast at the allocated time, trumpets were sounded and the camp's tents and huts were dismantled and preparations made for departure. The trumpet then sounded again with the signal for \"stand by to march\". [[Mule]]s and wagons of the baggage train would be loaded and units formed up. The camp would then be burned to the ground to prevent its later occupation and use by the enemy. The [[trumpet]]s would then be sounded for a final time and then the troops were asked three times whether they were ready, to which they were expected to shout together \"Ready!\", before marching off.<ref>Williamson, G. A., (tr), Josephus, ''The Jewish War'', Penguin Books, 1959, p. 378-179</ref>\n\n'''Intelligence.''' Good Roman commanders did not hesitate to exploit useful [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], particularly where a siege situation or impending clash in the field was developing. Information was gathered from spies, collaborators, diplomats and envoys, and allies. Intercepted messages during the [[Second Punic War]] for example were an intelligence coup for the Romans, and enabled them to dispatch two armies to find and destroy [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]]'s Carthaginian force, preventing his reinforcement of Hannibal. Commanders also kept an eye on the situation in Rome since political enemies and rivals could use an unsuccessful campaign to inflict painful career and personal damage. During this initial phase, the usual field [[reconnaissance]] was also conducted - patrols might be sent out, raids mounted to probe for weaknesses, prisoners snatched, and local inhabitants intimidated.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\">Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', (Cassell 2001) pp. 43\u201378</ref>\n\n'''Morale.''' If the field of potential battle were near, the movement became more careful and more tentative. Several days might be spent in a location studying the terrain and opposition, while the troops were prepared mentally and physically for battle. Pep talks, sacrifices to the gods and the announcements of good [[omen]]s might be carried out. A number of practical demonstrations might also be undertaken to test enemy reaction as well as to build troop morale. Part of the army might be led out of the camp and drawn up in battle array towards the enemy. If the enemy refused to come out and at least make a demonstration, the commander could claim a moral advantage for his men, contrasting the timidity of the opposition with the resolution of his fighting forces.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\"/>\n\nHistorian Adrian Goldsworthy notes that such tentative pre-battle manoeuvring was typical of ancient armies as each side sought to gain the maximum advantage before the encounter.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 50-69\">Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', (Cassell 2001) p. 50-69</ref> During this period, some ancient writers paint a picture of meetings between opposing commanders for negotiation or general discussion, as with the famous pre-clash conversation between [[Hannibal]] and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]]. It's unknown if the recorded flowery speeches are non-fiction, but these encounters don't show a record of resolving the conflict by means other than the anticipated battle.\n\n===Deployment for combat===\nPre-battle manoeuvre gave the competing commanders a feel for the impending clash, but final outcomes could be unpredictable, even after the start of hostilities. Skirmishing could get out of hand, launching both main forces towards one another. Political considerations, exhaustion of supplies, or even rivalry between commanders for glory could also spark a forward launch, as at the [[Battle of the Trebia River]].<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\"/> The Roman army after the [[Marian reforms]] was also unique in the ancient world because when lined up opposite an enemy readying for battle it was completely silent except for the orders of officers and the sound of trumpets signalling orders. The reason for this was because the soldiers needed to be able to hear such instruction, the [[Optios]] of the Legions would patrol behind the century and anyone who was talking or failing to obey orders immediately was struck with the stick of the optio. This silence also had the unintended consequence of being very intimidating to its enemies because they recognized this took immense discipline to achieve before a battle.\n\n====Layout of the triple line====\n<!-- {{noredirect|Triplex acies}} redirects here -->\nOnce the machinery was in motion however, the Roman infantry typically was deployed, as the main body, facing the enemy. During deployment in the Republican era, the maniples were commonly arranged in ''triplex acies'' (triple battle order): that is, in three ranks, with the [[hastati]] in the first rank (that nearest the enemy), the [[principes]] in the second rank, and the veteran ''[[triarii]]'' in the third and final rank as [[barrier troops]], or sometimes even further back as a strategic reserve. When in danger of imminent defeat, the first and second lines, the hastati and principes, ordinarily fell back on the ''triarii'' to reform the line to allow for either a counter-attack or an orderly withdrawal. Because falling back on the ''triarii'' was an act of desperation, to mention \"falling on the triarii\" (''\"ad triarios rediisse\"'') became a common Roman phrase indicating one to be in a desperate situation.<ref>Warry, ''Warfare in the Ancient World'', op. cit</ref>\n\nWithin this triplex acies system, contemporary Roman writers talk of the maniples adopting a checkered formation called ''[[quincunx]]'' when deployed for battle but not yet engaged. In the first line, the hastati left modest gaps between each maniple. The second line consisting of principes followed in a similar manner, lining up behind the gaps left by the first line.<ref>Taylor, Michael J. (2014). \"Roman Infantry Tactics in the Mid-Republic: A Reevaluation\". ''Historia'' 63, 301\u2013322.</ref> This was also done by the third line, standing behind the gaps in the second line. The velites were deployed in front of this line in a continuous, loose-formation line.<ref>See Polybius, ''The Histories'' for original commentary, ''The Histories'' or ''The Rise of the Roman Empire'' by Polybius: ** At [[Perseus Project]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+toc English & Greek version]</ref>\n\nThe Roman manoeuvre was a complex one, filled with the dust of thousands of soldiers wheeling into place, and the shouting of officers moving to and from as they attempted to maintain order. Several thousand men had to be positioned from column into line, with each unit taking its designated place, along with light troops and cavalry. The fortified camps were laid out and organized to facilitate deployment. It might take some time for the final array of the host, but when accomplished the army's grouping of legions represented a formidable fighting force, typically arranged in three lines with a frontage as long as one mile (about 1.5&nbsp;km<!-- The Roman mile was slightly shorter than the modern imperial mile, see [[Mile#Roman mile]] -->).<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_a\">Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', op. cit</ref>\n\nA general three-line deployment was to remain over the centuries, although the [[Marian reforms]] phased out most divisions based on age and class, standardized weapons and reorganized the legions into bigger manoeuvre units like cohorts. The overall size of the legion and length of the soldier's service also increased on a more permanent basis.<ref>[http://romans.etrusia.co.uk/roman_army_print Wake, T., \"The Roman Army After Marius' Reforms\", 28 February 2006.]</ref>\n\n====Maneuvering====\n[[Image:Rom-mnpl-1.png|frame|center]]\nAs the army approached its enemy, the [[velites]] in front would throw their javelins at the enemy and then retreat through the gaps in the lines. This was an important innovation since in other armies of the period skirmishers would have to either retreat through their own army's ranks, causing confusion or else to flee around either flank of their own army. After the velites had retreated through the hastati, the 'posterior' century would march to the left and then forward so that they presented a solid line, creating a solid line of soldiers. The same procedure would be employed as they passed through the second and third ranks or turned to the side to channel down the gap between the first and second rows on route to help guard the legion's flanks.<ref>Harkness, ''The Roman Military System'', op. cit</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rom-mnpl-2.png|frame|center]]\n\nAt this point, the legion then presented a solid line to the enemy and the legion was in the correct formation for engagement. When the enemy closed, the hastati would charge. If they were losing the fight, the 'posterior' century returned to its position creating gaps again. Then the maniples would fall back through the gaps in the principes, who followed the same procedure to form a battle line and charge. If the principes could not break the enemy, they would retreat behind the ''triarii'' and the whole army would leave the battlefield in good order. According to some writers, the ''triarii'' formed a continuous line when they deployed, and their forward movement allowed scattered or discomfited units to rest and reform, to later rejoin the struggle.<ref>Pierre Brimal, ''The Civilization of Rome'', Simon and Schuster: 1963, Chap 5: ''The Conquerors'', pg 162\u2013196</ref>\n\nThe manipular system allowed engaging every kind of enemy even in rough terrain, because the legion had both flexibility and toughness according to the deployment of its lines. Lack of a strong cavalry corps, however, was a major flaw of the Roman forces.\n\nIn the later imperial army, the general deployment was very similar, with the cohorts deploying in quincunx pattern. In a reflection of the earlier placement of the veteran ''triarii'' in the rear, the less experienced cohorts - usually the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th - were in the front; the more experienced cohorts - 1st, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th - were placed behind.<ref>Warry, op. cit.</ref>\n\n====Formations====\nThe above is only standard procedure and was often modified; for example, at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]], Scipio deployed his entire legion in a single line to envelop [[Hannibal]]'s army just as Hannibal had done at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. A brief summary of alternative formations known to have been used is shown below:\n\n[[Image:Mpl-frm-variations.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Combat===\n'''Hand-to-hand engagement after the release of missile weapons:''' Once the deployment and initial skirmishing described above took place, the main body of heavy infantry closed the gap and attacked the double. The front ranks usually cast their [[Pilum|pila]], and the following ranks hurled theirs over the heads of the front-line fighters. After the pila were cast, the soldiers then drew their swords and engaged the enemy. Emphasis was on using the shield to provide maximum body coverage, and for pushing enemies, while attacking with their [[gladius]] in thrusts and short cuts in [[Clinch fighting|clinch]], minimizing exposure to the enemy. In the combat that ensued, Roman discipline, heavy shield, armour and training were to give them important advantages in combat.\n\n'''The acute shock of combat:''' Some scholars of the Roman infantry maintain that the intense [[Physical trauma|trauma]] and stress of hand-to-hand combat meant that the contenders did not simply hack at one another continuously until one dropped. Instead, there were short periods of intense, vicious fighting. If indecisive, the contenders might fall back a short distance to recuperate, and then surge forward to renew the struggle. Others behind them would be stepping up into the fray meanwhile, engaging new foes or covering their colleagues. The individual warrior could thus count on temporary relief, rather than endless fighting until death or crippling injury. As the battle progressed, the massive physical and mental stress intensified. The stamina and willpower demanded to make yet one more charge, to make yet one more surge grew even greater.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 50-69\"/> Eventually one side began to break down, and it is then that the greatest slaughter began.\n\n'''Use of war machines and covering fire:''' Many Roman battles, especially during the late empire, were fought with the preparatory fire from [[catapult]]s, [[ballista]]s and [[Onager (weapon)|onagers]]. These war machines, a form of ancient [[artillery]], fired arrows and large stones towards the enemy (although many historians question the battlefield effectiveness of such weapons). Following this barrage, the Roman infantry advanced, in four lines, until they came within 30 meters of the enemy, then they halted, hurled their pila and charged. If the first line was repelled by the enemy, another line would rapidly resume the attack. Often this rapid sequence of deadly attacks proved the key to victory. Another common tactic was to taunt the enemy with feigned charges and rapid arrow fire by the ''auxiliares equites'' (auxiliary cavalry), forcing the enemy into pursuing them, and then leading the enemy into an ambush where they would be counterattacked by Roman heavy infantry and cavalry.\n\n===3-line system advantages===\n\n====Flexibility====\nSome ancient sources such as [[Polybius]] seem to imply that the legions could fight with gaps in their lines. Yet, most sources seem to admit that more usually a line would form into a solid front. Various approaches have been taken to reconcile these possibilities with the ancient writings.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army at War, 100 BC- AD200'', (Oxford, 1996), pp. 179-80</ref> The advantages of gaps are obvious when a formation is on the move- it can more easily flow around obstacles and manoeuvre and control are enhanced and, as the Romans did in the pre-Marius republic, place baggage between the lines meaning that the cargo cannot be easily captured and that the army can quickly get ready for a battle by using it as cover. After the approach marching was complete, it would be extremely difficult to deploy an unbroken army of men for combat across any but the flattest ground without some sort of intervals. Many ancient armies used gaps of some sort, even the [[Carthaginians]], who typically withdrew their initial skirmishing troops between the spaces before the main event. Even more loosely organized enemies like the Germanic hosts typically charged in distinct groups with small gaps between them, rather than marching up in a neat line.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\">Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', op. cit.</ref>\n\nFighting with gaps is thus feasible as writers like Polybius assert. According to those who support the ''quincunx'' formation view, what made the Roman approach stand out is that their intervals were generally larger and more systematically organized than those of other ancient armies. Each gap was covered by maniples or cohorts from lines farther back. Penetration of any significance could not just slip in unmolested. It would not only be mauled as it fought past the gauntlet of the first line but would also clash with aggressive units moving up to plug the space.<ref>Goldsworthy, 1996, pp. 138-40</ref> From a larger standpoint, as the battle waxed and waned, fresh units might be deployed through the intervals to relieve the men of the first line, allowing continual pressure to be brought forward.\n\n====Mixing of a continuous front with interval fighting====\nOne scenario for not using gaps is deployment in a limited space, such as the top of a hill or ravine, where extensive spreading out would not be feasible. Another is a particular attack formation, such as the wedge discussed above, or an encirclement as at the [[battle of Ilipa]]. Yet another is a closing phase manoeuvre when a solid line is constructed to make a last, final push as in the [[battle of Zama]]. During the maelstrom of battle, it is also possible that as the units merged into line, the general checkerboard spacing became more compressed or even disappeared, and the fighting would see a more or less solid line engaged with the enemy. Thus gaps at the beginning of the struggle might tend to vanish in the closing phases.<ref>Lt. Col. S.G. Brady, ''The Military Affairs of Ancient Rome and Roman Art of War in Caesar's Time'', The Military Service Publishing Company: 1947- url: http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/romanarmy/</ref>\n\nSome historians view the intervals as primarily useful in maneuver. Before the legionaries closed with the enemy each echelon would form a solid line to engage. If things went badly for the first line, it would retreat through the gaps and the second echelon moved up- again forming a continuous front. Should they be discomfited, there still remained the veterans of the ''triarii'' who let the survivors retreat through the preset gaps. The veterans then formed a continuous front to engage the enemy or provided cover for the retreat of the army as a whole. The same procedure was followed when the ''triarii'' was phased out - intervals for manoeuvre, reforming and recovery- solid line to engage.<ref>Nardo, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 23\u201329</ref> Some writers maintain that in [[Julius Caesar|Caesar's]] armies the use of the ''quincunx'' and its gaps seems to have declined, and his legions generally deployed in three unbroken lines as shown above, with four cohorts in front, and three apiece in the echeloned order. The relief was provided by the second and third lines 'filtering' forward to relieve their comrades in small groups, while the exhausted and wounded eased back from the front.<ref>Brady, op. cit, See also Warry, pg 169-170</ref> The Romans still remained flexible however, using gaps and deploying four or sometimes two lines based on the tactical situation.<ref>John Warry, ''Warfare in the Ancient World'', p. 169-170</ref>\n\n====Line spacing and combat stamina====\nAnother unique feature of the Roman infantry was the depth of its spacing. Most ancient armies deployed in shallower formations, particularly [[phalanx formation|phalanx]]-type forces. Phalanxes might deepen their ranks heavily to add both stamina and shock power, but their general approach still favoured one massive line, as opposed to the deep three-layer Roman arrangement. The advantage of the Roman system is that it allowed the continual funnelling or metering of combat power forward over a longer period&mdash;massive, steadily renewed pressure to the front&mdash;until the enemy broke. Deployment of the second and third lines required careful consideration by the Roman commander. Deployed too early, and they might get entangled in the frontal fighting and become exhausted. Deployed too late, and they might be swept away in a rout if the first line began to break. Tight control had to be maintained, hence the 3rd line ''triarii'' were sometimes made to [[Squatting position|squat]] or [[kneel]], effectively discouraging premature movement to the front. The Roman commander was thus generally mobile, constantly moving from spot to spot, and often riding back in person to fetch reserves if there was no time for standard messenger service. A large number of officers in the typical Roman army, and the flexible breakdown into sub-units like cohorts or maniples greatly aided coordination of such moves.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', pp.53\u201362</ref>\n\nWhatever the actual formation took however, the ominous funnelling or surge of combat power up to the front remained constant:\n:''\"When the first line as a whole had done its best and become weakened and exhausted by losses, it gave way to the relief of freshmen from the second line who, passing through it gradually, pressed forward one by one, or in single file, and worked their way into the fight in the same way. Meanwhile the tired men of the original first line, when sufficiently rested, reformed and re-entered the fight. This continued until all men of the first and second lines had been engaged. This does not presuppose an actual withdrawal of the first line, but rather a merging, a blending or a coalescing of both lines. Thus the enemy was given no rest and was continually opposed by fresh troops until, exhausted and demoralized, he yielded to repeated attacks.\"''<ref>Lt. Col. S.G. Brady, ''The Military Affairs of Ancient Rome and Roman Art of War in Caesar's Time'', The Military Service Publishing Company: 1947&ndash; url: http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/romanarmy/</ref>\n\n===Post-deployment commands===\n[[Image:Reenact testudo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Roman re-enactors demonstrate a variant of the Roman [[testudo formation]]]]\n\nWhatever the deployment, the Roman army was marked both by flexibility and strong discipline and cohesion. Different formations were assumed according to different tactical situations.\n* ''Repellere equites'' (\"repel horsemen/knights\") was the formation used to resist cavalry. The legionaries would assume a [[Infantry square|square]] formation, holding their pila as spears in the space between their shields and strung together shoulder to shoulder.\n* At the command ''iacite pila'', the legionaries hurled their pila at the enemy.\n* At the command ''cuneum formate'', the infantry formed a [[Flying wedge|wedge]] to charge and break enemy lines. This formation was used as a [[Shock troops|shock]] tactic.\n* At the command ''contendite vestra sponte'', the legionaries assumed an aggressive stance and attacked every opponent they faced.\n* At the command ''orbem formate'', the legionaries assumed a circle-like formation with the archers placed in the midst of and behind the legionaries providing missile fire support. This tactic was used mainly when a small number of legionaries had to hold a position and were surrounded by enemies.\n* At the command ''ciringite frontem'', the legionaries held their position.\n* At the command ''frontem allargate'', a scattered formation was adopted.\n* At the command ''testudinem formate'', the legionaries assumed the [[Testudo formation|''testudo'' (tortoise) formation]]. This was slow-moving but almost impenetrable to enemy fire, and thus very effective during sieges and/or when facing off against enemy archers. However, the testudo formation didn't allow for effective close combat and therefore it was used when the enemy were far enough away so as the legionaries could get into another formation before being attacked.\n*At the command ''tecombre'', the legionaries would break the Testudo formation and revert to their previous formation.\n* At the command ''Agmen formate'', the legionaries assumed a [[Infantry square|square formation]], which was also the typical shape of a century in battle.\n\n==Siegecraft and fortifications==\n===Besieging cities===\n''Oppidum expugnare'' was the Roman term for besieging cities. It was divided into three phases:\n[[Image:Balliste.jpg|thumb|Modern reconstruction of a ''Scorpio''.]]\n# In the first phase, engineers (the ''cohors fabrorum'') built a fortified camp near the city with walls of [[circumvallation]] and at the command 'turres extruere' built watch towers to prevent the enemy from bringing in reinforcements. Siege towers were built, trenches were dug and traps set all around the city. Also second, exterior line of walls (''[[contravallation]]'')  was built around the city facing the enemy, as Caesar did at the [[Battle of Alesia]]. Sometimes the Romans would [[Mining (military)|mine]] the enemy's walls.\n# The second phase began with [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and [[ballista]] fire to cover the approach of the siege towers, which were full of legionaries ready to assault the wall's defenders. Meanwhile, other cohorts approached the city's wall in [[testudo formation]], bringing up battering rams and ladders to breach the gates and scale the walls.\n# The third phase included the opening of the city's main gate by the cohorts which had managed to break through or scale the walls, provided the rams had not knocked the gate open. Once the main gate was opened or the walls breached, the cavalry and other cohorts entered the city to finish off the remaining defenders.\n\n===Field fortifications===\nWhile strong cities/forts and elaborate sieges to capture them were common throughout the ancient world, the Romans were unique among ancient armies in their extensive use of field fortifications. In campaign after campaign, enormous effort was expended to dig\u2014a job done by the ordinary legionary. His field pack included a shovel, a ''[[dolabra]]'' or pickaxe, and a wicker basket for hauling dirt. Some soldiers also carried a type of turf cutter. With these, they dug trenches, built walls and palisades and constructed assault roads. The operations of [[Julius Caesar]] at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] are well known. The Gallic city was surrounded by massive double walls penning in defenders, and keeping out relieving attackers. A network of camps and forts were included in these works. The inner trench alone was {{convert|20|ft|m}} deep, and Caesar diverted a river to fill it with water. The ground was also sown with caltrops of iron barbs at various places to discourage assault. Surprisingly for such an infantry centred battle, Caesar relied heavily on [[cavalry]] forces to counter Gallic sorties. Ironically, many of these were from Germanic tribes who had come to terms earlier.<ref name=\"Warry, pp. 159-172\">Warry, pp. 159\u2013172</ref>\n\nThe power of Roman field camps has been noted earlier, but in other actions, the Romans sometimes used trenches to secure their flanks against envelopment when they were outnumbered, as Caesar did during operations in Belgaic [[Gaul]]. In the [[Brittany]] region of France, [[Mole (architecture)|moles]] and breakwaters were constructed at enormous effort to assault the estuarine strongholds of the Gauls. Internal Roman fighting between Caesar and Pompey also saw the frequent employment of trenches, counter-trenches, dug-in strong points, and other works as the contenders manoeuvred against each other in field combat.<ref name=\"Warry, pp. 159-172\"/> In the latter stages of the empire, the extensive use of such field fortifications declined as the heavy infantry itself was phased down. Nevertheless, they were an integral part of the relentless Roman rise to dominance over large parts of the ancient world.<ref>Warry, pp. 115\u2013169</ref>\n\n==Infantry effectiveness==\n\n===Roman infantry versus the Macedonian phalanx===\n'''Strengths of the Macedonian [[phalanx formation|phalanx]].''' Prior to the rise of Rome, the Macedonian phalanx was the premiere infantry force in the Western World. It had proven itself on the battlefields of Mediterranean Europe, from [[Sparta]] to [[Macedon]]ia, and had met and overcome several strong non-European armies from Persia to Pakistan/Northwest India. Packed into a dense armoured mass, and equipped with massive pikes 12 to {{convert|21|ft|m}} in length, the phalanx was a formidable force. While defensive configurations were sometimes used, the phalanx was most effective when it was moving forward in attack, either in a frontal charge or in \"oblique\" or echeloned order against an opposing flank, as the victories of [[Alexander the Great]] and Theban innovator [[Epaminondas]] attest. When working with other formations\u2014light infantry and cavalry\u2014it was, at its height under Alexander, without peer.<ref name=\"Polybius, Histories pp. 511-12\">Polybius, ''Histories'' pp. 511-12</ref>\n\n'''Weaknesses of the Macedonian phalanx.''' Nevertheless, the Macedonian phalanx had key weaknesses. It had some manoeuvrability, but once a clash was joined this decreased, particularly on rough ground. Its \"dense pack\" approach also made it rigid. Compressed in the heat of battle, its troops could only primarily fight facing forward. The diversity of troops gave the phalanx great flexibility, but this diversity was a double-edged sword, relying on a mix of units that was complicated to control and position. These included not only the usual heavy infantrymen, cavalry and light infantry but also various elite units, medium armed groups, foreign contingents with their own styles and shock units of [[war-elephant]]s.<ref>John Warry, Warfare in the Ancient World, (St. Martin's, 1980), pp. 70-86</ref> Such \"mixed\" forces presented additional command and control problems. If properly organized and fighting together a long time under capable leaders, they could be very proficient. The campaigns of Alexander and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] (a Hellenic-style formation of mixed contingents) show this. Without such long-term cohesion and leadership, however, their performance was uneven. By the time the Romans were engaging against Hellenistic armies, the Greeks had ceased to use strong flank guards and cavalry contingents, and their system had degenerated into a mere clash of phalanxes. This was the formation overcome by the Romans at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]].\n\n'''Advantages of Roman infantry.''' The Romans themselves had retained some aspects of the classical phalanx (not to be confused with the Macedonian phalanx) in their early legions, most notably the final line of fighters in the classic \"triple line\", the spearmen of the ''triarii''. The long pikes of the ''triarii'' were to eventually disappear, and all hands were uniformly equipped with short sword, shield and pilum, and deployed in the distinctive Roman tactical system, which provided more standardization and cohesion in the long run over the Hellenic type formations.\n\nPhalanxes facing the legion were vulnerable to the more flexible Roman \"checkerboard\" deployment, which provided each fighting man a good chunk of personal space to engage in close order fighting. The manipular system also allowed entire Roman sub-units to manoeuvre more widely, freed from the need to always remain tightly packed in rigid formation. The deep three-line deployment of the Romans allowed combat pressure to be steadily applied forward. Most phalanxes favoured one huge line several ranks deep. This might do well in the initial stages, but as the battle entangled more and more men, the stacked Roman formation allowed fresh pressure to be imposed over a more extended time. As combat lengthened and the battlefield compressed, the phalanx might thus become exhausted or rendered immobile, while the Romans still had enough left to not only manoeuvre but to make the final surges forward.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_a\" /> Hannibal's deployment at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] appears to recognize this\u2014hence the Carthaginian also used a deep three-layer approach, sacrificing his first two lower quality lines and holding back his combat-hardened veterans of Italy for the final encounter. Hannibal's arrangement had much to recommend it given his weakness in cavalry and infantry, but he made no provision for one line relieving the other as the Romans did. Each line fought its own lonely battle and the last ultimately perished when the Romans reorganized for a final surge.\n\nThe legions also drilled and trained together over a more extended time, and were more uniform and streamlined, (unlike Hannibal's final force and others) enabling even less than brilliant army commanders to manoeuvre and position their forces proficiently. These qualities, among others, made them more than a match for the phalanx, when they met in combat.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\" />\n\nAccording to Polybius, in his comparison of the phalanx versus the Roman system:\n:''\".. Whereas the phalanx requires one time and one type of ground. Its use requires flat and level ground which is unencumbered by any obstacles.. If the enemy refuses to come down to [meet it on the level ground].. what purpose can the phalanx serve?.. [Also] the phalanx soldier cannot operate in either smaller units or singly, whereas the Roman formation is highly flexible. Every Roman soldier.. can adapt himself equally well to any place of time and meet an attack from any quarter.. Accordingly, since the effective use of parts of the Roman army is so much superior, their plans are much more likely to achieve success.\"''<ref name=\"Polybius, Histories pp. 511-12\"/>\n\n====Versus Pyrrhus====\n{{See also|Pyrrhus of Epirus}}\n\nThe Greek king Pyrrhus' phalangical system was to prove a tough trial for the Romans. Despite several defeats, the Romans inflicted such losses on the [[Epirote]] army that the phrase \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" has become a byword for a victory won at a terrible cost. A skilful and experienced commander, Pyrrhus deployed a typically mixed phalanx system, including shock units of war-elephants, and formations of light infantry ([[peltasts]]), elite units, and cavalry to support his infantry. Using these he was able to defeat the Romans twice, with a third battle deemed inconclusive or a limited Roman tactical success by many scholars. The battles below (see individual articles for detailed accounts) illustrate the difficulties of fighting against phalanx forces. If well-led and deployed (compare Pyrrhus to the fleeing [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] at Pydna below), they presented a credible infantry alternative to the heavy legion. The Romans, however, were to learn from their mistakes. In subsequent battles after the Pyrrhic wars, they showed themselves masters of the Hellenic phalanx.\n\n* [[Battle of Heraclea]]\n* [[Battle of Asculum]]\n* [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]\n\n====Notable triumphs====\n\n=====Battle of Cynoscephalae=====\n{{main|Battle of Cynoscephalae}}\n\nIn this battle the Macedonian phalanx originally held the high ground but all of its units had not been properly positioned due to earlier skirmishing. Nevertheless, an advance by its left-wing drove back the Romans, who counterattacked on the right flank and made some progress against a somewhat disorganized Macedonian left. However, the issue was still in doubt until an unknown tribune (officer) detached 20 maniples from the Roman line and made an encircling attack against the Macedonian rear. This caused the enemy phalanx to collapse, securing a route for the Romans. The more flexible, streamlined legionary organization had exploited the weaknesses of the densely packed phalanx. Such triumphs secured Roman hegemony in Greece and adjoining lands.\n\n=====Battle of Pydna=====\n{{main|Battle of Pydna}}\n\nAt Pydna the contenders deployed on a relatively flat plain, and the Macedonians had augmented the infantry with a sizeable cavalry contingent. At the hour of decision, the enemy phalanx advanced in formidable array against the Roman line and made some initial progress. However, the ground it had to advance over was rough, and the powerful phalangial formation lost its tight cohesion. The Romans absorbed the initial shock and came on into the fray, where their more spacious formation and continuously applied pressure proved decisive in hand-to-hand combat on the rough ground. Shield and sword at close quarters on such terrain neutralized the long [[pike (weapon)|pike]], and supplementary Macedonian weapons (lighter armour and a dagger-like short sword) made an indifferent showing against the skilful and aggressive assault of the heavy Roman infantrymen. The opposition also failed to deploy supporting forces effectively to help the phalanx at its time of dire need. Indeed, the Macedonian commander, Perseus, seeing the situation deteriorating, seems to have fled without even bringing his cavalry into the engagement. The affair was decided in less than two hours, with a comprehensive defeat for the Macedonians.\n\n====Other anti-phalanx tactics====\n\"Breaking [[phalanx formation|phalanxes]]\" illustrates more of the Roman army's flexibility. When the Romans faced [[phalangite]] armies, the legions often deployed the [[velites]] in front of the enemy with the command to ''contendite vestra sponte'' (attack), presumably with their javelins, to cause confusion and panic in the solid blocks of phalanxes. Meanwhile, [[Archery|auxilia archers]] were deployed on the wings of the legion in front of the [[cavalry]], in order to defend their withdrawal. These archers were ordered to ''eiaculare flammas'', fire incendiary [[arrow]]s into the enemy. The cohorts then advanced in a [[Formation (military)|wedge formation]], supported by the velites' and auxiliaries' fire, and charged into the phalanx at a single point, breaking it, then flanking it with the cavalry to seal the victory. See the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] for evidence of fire-arrows being used.\n\n====Versus Hannibal's Carthage====\n'''Tactical superiority of Hannibal's forces'''. While not a classic phalanx force, Hannibal's army was composed of \"mixed\" contingents and elements common to Hellenic formations, and it is told that towards the end of his life, Hannibal reportedly named Pyrrhus as the commander of the past that he most admired<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars''</ref> Rome however had blunted Pyrrhus' hosts prior to the rise of Hannibal, and given their advantages in organization, discipline, and resource mobilization, why did they not make a better showing in the field against the Carthaginian, who throughout most of his campaign in Italy suffered from numerical inferiority and lack of support from his homeland?\n\nHannibal's individual genius, the steadiness of his core troops (forged over several years of fighting together in Spain, and later in Italy) and his cavalry arm seem to be the decisive factors. Time after time Hannibal exploited the tendencies of the Romans, particularly their eagerness to close and achieve a decisive victory. The cold, tired, wet legionnaires that slogged out of the Trebia River to form up on the river bank are but one example of how Hannibal forced or manipulated the Romans into fighting on his terms, and on the ground of his own choosing. The later debacles at [[Battle of Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], forced the proud Romans to avoid battle, shadowing the Carthaginians from the high ground of the Apennines, unwilling to risk a significant engagement on the plains where the enemy cavalry held sway.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\" />\n\n'''Growing Roman tactical sophistication and ability to adapt overcome earlier disasters.''' But while the case of Hannibal underscored that the Romans were far from invincible, it also demonstrated their long-term strengths. Rome had a vast manpower surplus far outnumbering Hannibal that gave them more options and flexibility. They isolated and eventually bottled up the Carthaginians and hastened their withdrawal from Italy with the constant manoeuvre. More importantly, they used their manpower resources to launch an offensive into Spain and Africa. They were willing to absorb the humiliation in Italy and remain on the strategic defensive, but with typical relentless persistence they struck elsewhere, to finally crush their foes.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\" />\n\nThey also learned from those enemies. The operations of [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] were an improvement on some of those who had previously faced Hannibal, showing a higher level of advance thinking, preparation and organization. (Compare with Sempronius at the [[Battle of the Trebia|Battle of the Trebia River]] for example). Scipio's contribution was in part to implement more flexible manoeuvre of tactical units, instead of the straight-ahead, three-line grind favoured by some contemporaries. He also made better use of cavalry, traditionally an arm in which the Romans were lacking. His operations also included pincer movements, a consolidated battle line, and \"reverse Cannae\" formations and cavalry movements. His victories in Spain and the African campaign demonstrated a new sophistication in Roman warfare and reaffirmed the Roman capacity to adapt, persist and overcome.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\"/> See detailed battles:\n\n* [[Battle of Baecula]]\n* [[Battle of Ilipa]]\n* [[Battle of Zama]]\n\n===Roman infantry versus Gallic and the Germanic tribes===\n\n====Barbarian armies====\nViews of the Gallic enemies of Rome have varied widely. Some older histories consider them to be backward savages, ruthlessly destroying the civilization and \"grandeur that was Rome.\" Some modernist views see them in a proto-nationalist light, ancient freedom fighters resisting the iron boot of empire. Often their bravery is celebrated as worthy adversaries of Rome. See the [[Dying Gaul]] for an example. The Gallic opposition was also composed of a large number of different peoples and tribes, geographically ranging from the mountains of Switzerland to the lowlands of France and thus are not easy to categorize. The term \"Gaul\" has also been used interchangeably to describe [[Celt]]ic peoples farther afield in [[Brittannia|Britain]] adding even more to the diversity of peoples lumped together under this name. From a military standpoint, however, they seem to have shared certain general characteristics: tribal polities with a relatively small and lesser elaborated state structure, light weaponry, fairly unsophisticated tactics and organization<!--professional soldiers gathering around a chief-->, a high degree of mobility<!--some sources on the percentage of cavalry/chariots-->, and inability to sustain combat power in their field forces over a lengthy period.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck, Warfare in Antiquity\">Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''Warfare in Antiquity''</ref> Roman sources reflect on the prejudices of their times, but nevertheless testify to the Gauls' fierceness and bravery.\n:''\"Their chief weapons were long, two-edged swords of soft iron. For defence, they carried small wicker shields. Their armies were undisciplined mobs, greedy for plunder.. Brave to the point of recklessness, they were formidable warriors, and the ferocity of their first assault inspired terror even in the ranks of veteran armies.\"''<ref>Don Nardo, ''The Roman Army: Instrument of Power'', Lucent Books: 2004, 22-23</ref>\n\n====Early Gallic victories====\nThough popular accounts celebrate the legions and an assortment of charismatic commanders quickly vanquishing massive hosts of \"wild barbarians\",<ref>The opening scene of the 2000 US movie ''Gladiator'', showing Germanic [[barbarians]] being vanquished, was shown to senior American officers before the 2003 US attack on Iraq as a motivational tool- reported in Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor, ''Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq'', (Pantheon Books, 2006) p. 164</ref> Rome suffered a number of early defeats against such tribal armies. As early as the Republican period (circa 390\u2013387 BC), they had [[Battle of the Allia|sacked Rome]] under [[Brennus]], and had won several other victories such as the [[Battle of Noreia]] and the [[Battle of Arausio]]. The foremost Gallic triumph in this early period was ''\"The Day of Allia\"''- July 18- when Roman troops were routed and driven into the Allia River. Henceforth, July 18 was considered an unlucky date on the Roman Calendar.<ref>Don Nardo, ''The Roman Army'': pp. 22-23</ref>\n\nSome writers suggest that as a result of such debacles, the expanding Roman power began to adjust to this vigorous, fast-moving new enemy.<ref>Nardo, op. cit</ref> The Romans began to phase out the monolithic phalanx they formerly fought in and adopted the more flexible manipular formation. The circular hoplite shield was also enlarged and eventually replaced with the rectangular ''scutum'' for better protection. The heavy phalanx spear was replaced by the pila, suitable for throwing. Only the veterans of the ''triarii'' retained the long spear- vestige of the former phalanx. Such early reforms also aided the Romans in their conquest of the rest of Italy over such foes as the Samnites, Latins and Greeks.<ref>Nardo, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 23-30</ref> As time went on Roman arms saw increasing triumph over the Gallics, particularly in the campaigns of Caesar. In the early imperial period, however, Germanic warbands inflicted one of Rome's greatest military defeats, (the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]) which saw the destruction of three imperial legions and was to place a limit on Roman expansion in the West. And it was these Germanic tribes in part (most having some familiarity with Rome and its culture, and becoming more Romanized themselves) that were to eventually bring about the Roman military's final demise in the West. Ironically, in the final days, the bulk of the fighting was between forces composed mostly of barbarians on either side.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation''</ref>\n\n====Tactical performance versus Gallic and Germanic opponents====\n\n=====Gallic and Germanic strengths=====\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SambreBattleV1.0.gif|thumb|right|Tactical map of near victory by the Gauls at the Sambre River. Note covering forests where the Germanic warriors massed in secret for the assault. Quick charges almost liquidated the Roman position.]] -->\n\nWhatever their particular culture, the Gallic and Germanic tribes generally proved themselves to be tough opponents, racking up several victories over their enemies. Some historians show that they sometimes used massed fighting in tightly packed phalanx-type formations with overlapping shields, and employed shield coverage during sieges. In open battle, they sometimes used a triangular \"wedge\" style formation in attack. Their greatest hope of success lay in 4 factors: (a) numerical superiority, (b) surprising the Romans (via an ambush for example) or in (c) advancing quickly to the fight, or (d) engaging the Romans over heavily covered or difficult terrain where units of the fighting horde could shelter within striking distance until the hour of decision, or if possible, withdraw and regroup between successive charges.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck 1990\">Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''History of the Art of War'', Vols. I & II. University of Nebraska Press (1990) [1920-21].</ref>\n\nMost significant Gallic and Germanic victories show two or more of these characteristics. The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] contains all four: numerical superiority, surprise,  quick charges to close rapidly, and favorable terrain and environmental conditions (thick forest and pounding rainstorms) that hindered Roman movement and gave the warriors enough cover to conceal their movements and mount successive attacks against the Roman line. Another factor in the Romans' defeat was a treacherous defection by [[Arminius]] and his contingent.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Macropedia, 1974 ed, \"Germans, Ancient\"</ref>\n\n=====Gallic and Germanic weaknesses=====\n\n'''Weaknesses in organization and equipment.''' Against the fighting men from the legion however, the Gauls, Iberians and Germanic forces faced a daunting task. The barbarians' rudimentary organization and tactics fared poorly against the well-oiled machinery that was the Legion. The fierceness of the Gallic and Germanic charges is often commented upon by some writers, and in certain circumstances, they could overwhelm Roman lines. Nevertheless, the in-depth Roman formation allowed adjustments to be made, and the continual application of forwarding pressure made long-term combat a hazardous proposition for the Gauls.\n\nFlank attacks were always possible, but the legion was flexible enough to pivot to meet this, either through sub-unit manoeuvre or through the deployment of lines farther back. The cavalry screen on the flanks also added another layer of security, as did nightly regrouping in fortified camps. The Gauls and Germans also fought with little or no [[armour]] and with weaker shields, putting them at a disadvantage against the legion. Other items of Roman equipment from studded sandals, to body armour, to metal helmets added to Roman advantages. Generally speaking, the Gauls and Germans needed to get into good initial position against the Romans and to overwhelm them in the early phases of the battle. An extended set-piece slogging match between the lightly armed tribesmen and the well-organized heavy legionaries usually spelt doom for the tribal fighters.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck 1990\"/> Caesar's slaughter of the Helvetii near the Sa\u00f4ne River is just one example of tribal disadvantage against the well-organized Romans,<ref>Nardo, pg 74</ref> as is the victory of Germanicus at the Weser River and Agricola against the Celtic tribesmen of Caledonia (Scotland) circa 84 A.D.<ref name=\"Nardo, pg. 90\">Nardo, pg. 90</ref>\n\n'''Weaknesses in logistics.''' Roman logistics also provided a trump card against Germanic foes as it had against so many previous foes. Tacitus in his ''Annals'' reports that the Roman commander Germanicus recognized that continued operations in Gaul would require long trains of men and material to come overland, where they would be subject to attack as they traversed the forests and swamps. He, therefore, opened sea and river routes, moving large quantities of supplies and reinforcements relatively close to the zone of battle, bypassing the dangerous land routes. In addition, the Roman fortified camps provided secure staging areas for offensive, defensive and logistical operations, once their troops were deployed. Assault roads and causeways were constructed on the marshy ground to facilitate manoeuvre, sometimes under direct Gallic attack. These Roman techniques repeatedly defeated their Germanic adversaries.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' - Book II - \"War with the Germans\", THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS, OUT OF THE FIRST SIX ANNALS OF TACITUS; WITH HIS ACCOUNT OF GERMANY, AND LIFE OF AGRICOLA, TRANSLATED BY THOMAS GORDON, 1917. url: https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7rtib10.txt</ref> While Germanic leaders and fighters influenced by Roman methods sometimes adapted them, most tribes did not have the strong organization of the Romans. As German scholar Hans Delbruck notes in his \"History of the Art of War\":\n:''\".. the superiority of the Roman art of warfare was based on the army organization.. a system that permitted very large masses of men to be concentrated at a given point, to move in an orderly fashion, to be fed, to be kept together. The Gauls could do none of these things.\"''<ref>Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''History of the Art of War'', (Vol. I, p. 510), University of Nebraska Press (1990) [1920-21].</ref>\n\n=====Gallic and Germanic chariots=====\nThe Gallic also demonstrated a high level of tactical prowess in some areas. Gallic [[chariot]] warfare, for example, showed a high degree of integration and coordination with infantry, and Gallic horse and chariot assaults sometimes threatened Roman forces in the field with annihilation. At the [[Battle of Sentinum]] for example, c. 295 BC, the Roman and Campanian cavalry encountered Gallic war-chariots and were routed in confusion\u2014driven back from the Roman infantry by the unexpected appearance of the fast-moving Gallic assault. The discipline of the Roman infantry restored the line, however, and a counterattack eventually defeated the Gallic forces and their allies.<ref>DENISON, GEORGE T. ''A History of Cavalry. From the earliest times, with Lessons for the Future''. London Macmillan and Co. 1877, 1913, pp 62-89 (In public domain- see Google Books</ref>\n\nThe accounts of [[Polybius]] leading up to the [[Battle of Telamon]], c. 225 BC mention chariot warfare, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The Gauls met comprehensive defeat by the Roman legions under [[Papus]] and [[Regulus]]. Chariot forces also attacked the legions as they were disembarking from ships during Caesar's invasion of Britain, but the Roman commander drove off the fast-moving assailants using covering fire (slings, arrows and engines of war) from his ships and reinforcing his shore party of infantry to charge and drive off the attack. In the open field against Caesar, the Gallic/Celtics apparently deployed chariots with a driver and an infantry fighter armed with javelins. During the clash, the chariots would drop off their warriors to attack the enemy and retire a short distance away, massed in reserve. From this position, they could retrieve the assault troops if the engagement was going badly, or apparently, pick them up and deploy elsewhere. Caesar's troops were discomfited by one such attack, and he met it by withdrawing into his fortified redoubt. A later Gallic attack against the Roman camp was routed.<ref>Gaius Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'', translated by W.A. McDevitte and W.S. Bohn. New York: Harper & Brothers, 1869. url: http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/caesar/gallic_e4.html#32</ref>\n\nSuperb as the Gallic fighters were, chariots were already declining as an effective weapon of war in the ancient world with the rise of mounted cavalry.<ref>[http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/chariot.htm Chariots: Warfare with Attitude]</ref> At the battle of Mons Grapius in Caledonia (circa 84AD), Celtic chariots made an appearance. However, they were no longer used in an offensive role but primarily for the pre-battle show - riding back and forth and hurling insults. The main encounter was decided by infantry and mounted cavalry.<ref name=\"Nardo, pg. 90\"/>\n\n=====Superior tactical organization: victory of Caesar at the Sambre River=====\nSuperior Gallic mobility and numbers often troubled Roman arms, whether deployed in decades-long mobile or guerrilla warfare or in decisive field engagement. The near-defeat of Caesar in his Gallic campaign confirms this latter pattern but also shows the strengths of Roman tactical organization and discipline. At the [[Battle of the Sabis]] river, (''see more detailed article'') contingents of the [[Nervii]], Atrebates, Veromandui and Aduatuci tribes massed secretly in the surrounding forests as the main Roman force was busy making camp on the opposite side of the river. Some distance away behind them slogged two slow-moving legions with the baggage train. Engaged in foraging and camp construction the Roman forces were somewhat scattered. As camp building commenced, the barbarian forces launched a ferocious attack, streaming across the shallow water and quickly assaulting the distracted Romans. This incident is discussed in Caesar's ''Gallic War Commentaries.''<ref>\n''[https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10657 Caesar's Commentaries (THE WAR IN GAUL - THE CIVIL WAR)]'' English translation by W. A. MACDEVITT, introduction by THOMAS DE QUINCEY (1915) -- At [[Gutenberg Project]]</ref>\n\nSo far the situation looked promising for the warrior host.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck, Warfare in Antiquity\"/> The 4 conditions above were in their favour: (a) numerical superiority, (b) the element of surprise, (c) a quick advance/assault, and (d) favourable terrain that masked their movements until the last minute. Early progress was spectacular as the initial Roman dispositions were driven back. A rout looked possible. Caesar himself rallied sections of his endangered army, impressing resolve upon the troops. With their customary discipline and cohesion, the Romans then began to drive back the [[barbarian]] assault. A charge by the Nervi tribe through a gap between the legions however almost turned the tide again, as the onrushing warriors seized the Roman camp and tried to outflank the other army units engaged with the rest of the tribal host. The initial phase of the clash had passed however and a slogging match ensued. The arrival of the two rear legions that had been guarding the baggage reinforced the Roman lines. Led by the 10th Legion, a counterattack was mounted with these reinforcements that broke the back of the barbarian effort and sent the tribesmen reeling in retreat. It was a close-run thing, illustrating both the fighting prowess of the tribal forces and the steady, disciplined cohesion of the Romans. Ultimately, the latter was to prove decisive in Rome's long fought conquest of Gaul.\n\n=====Persisting logistics strategy: Gallic victory at Gergovia=====\nAs noted above, the fierce charge of the Gauls and their individual prowess is frequently acknowledged by several ancient Roman writers.<ref>Theodore Dodge. 1892. C\u00e6sar: a history of the art of war among the Romans Down to the End of the Roman Empire. 2 vol. Houghton-Mifflin</ref> The [[Battle of Gergovia]] however demonstrates that the Gallic were capable of a level of strategic insight and operation beyond merely mustering warriors for an open field clash. Under their war leader [[Vercingetorix]], the Gallic pursued what some modern historians have termed a \"persisting\" or \"logistics strategy\" - a mobile approach relying not on direct open field clashes, but avoidance of major battle, \"scorched earth\" denial of resources, and the isolation and piecemeal destruction of Roman detachments and smaller unit groupings.<ref>Archer Jones. 2001. The art of war in the Western world. University of Illinois Press. pp. 68-89</ref> When implemented consistently, this strategy saw some success against Roman operations. According to Caesar himself, during the siege of the town of Bourges, the lurking warbands of Gauls were:\n\n:\"on the watch for our foraging and grain-gatherer parties, when necessarily scattered far afield he attacked them and inflicted serious losses... This imposed such scarcity upon the army that for several days they were without grain and staved off starvation only by driving cattle from remote villages.\"<ref>Jones, art of war..68-89</ref>\nCaesar countered with a strategy of enticing the Gallic forces out into open battle, or of blockading them into submission.\n\nAt the town of Gergovia, resource denial was combined with a concentration of superior force and multiple threats from more than one direction. This caused the opposing Roman forces to divide and ultimately fail. Gergovia was situated on the high ground of a tall hill, and Vercingetorix carefully drew up the bulk of his force on the slope, positioning allied tribes in designated places. He drilled his men and skirmished daily with the Romans, who had overrun a hilltop position and had created a small camp some distance from Caesar's larger main camp. A rallying of about 10,000 disenchanted Aeudan tribesmen (engineered by Vercingetorix's agents) created a threat in Caesar's rear, including a threat to a supply convoy promised by the allied Aeudans, and he diverted four legions to meet this danger.<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins (2002). Caesar's legion: the epic saga of Julius Caesar's elite tenth legion. Wiley. pp. 50\u201369</ref> This, however, gave Vercingetorix's forces the chance to concentrate in superior strength against the smaller two-legion force left behind at Gergovia, and desperate fighting ensued. Caesar dealt with the real threat, turned around and by ruthlessly forced marching once again consolidated his forces at the town. A feint using bogus cavalry by the Romans drew off part of the Gallic assault, and the Romans advanced to capture three more enemy outposts on the slope, and proceeded towards the walls of the stronghold. The diverted Gallic forces returned however and in frantic fighting outside the town walls, the Romans lost 700 men, including 46 centurions.\n\nCaesar commenced a retreat from the town with the victorious Gallic warriors in pursuit. The Roman commander, however, mobilized his 10th Legion as a blocking force to cover his withdrawal and after some fighting, the tribesmen themselves withdrew back to Gergovia, taking several captured legion standards. The vicious fighting around Gergovia was the first time Caesar had suffered a military reverse, demonstrating the Gallic martial valor noted by the ancient chroniclers. The hard battle is referenced by the Roman historian Plutarch, who writes of the Averni people showing visitors a sword in one of their temples, a weapon that reputedly belonged to Caesar himself. According to Plutarch, the Roman general was shown the sword in the temple at Gergovia some years after the battle, but he refused to reclaim it, saying that it was consecrated, and to leave it where it was.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dando-Collins. Caesar's legions. 52-68</ref>\n\nThe Gallic were unable to sustain their strategy, however, and Vercingetorix was to become trapped in Alesia, facing not divided sections or detachments of the Roman Army but Caesar's full force of approximately 70,000 men (50,000 legionnaires plus numerous additional auxiliary cavalry and infantry). This massive concentration of Romans was able to besiege the fortress in detail and repulse Gallic relief forces, and it fell in little more than a month.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Vercingetorix overall persisting logistics policy, however, demonstrates a significant level of strategic thinking. As historian A. Goldsworthy (2006) notes: \"His [Vercingetorix's] strategy was considerably more sophisticated than that employed by Caesar's earlier opponents..\"<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy. ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus''. Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 3291-359</ref> At Alesia this mobile approach became overly static. The Gauls gave battle at a place where they were inadequately provisioned for an extended siege, and where Caesar could bring his ''entire'' field force to bear on a single point without them being dissipated, and where his lines of supply were not effectively interdicted.<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins (2002). Caesar's legion: the epic saga of Julius Caesar's elite tenth legion. Wiley. pp. 50-69</ref> At Gergovia by contrast, Caesar's strength was divided by the appearance of another Gallic force in his rear (the Aeudans)- threatening his sources and lines of supply. Together with a strong defensive anvil, (the town) supported by an offensive hammer (the open field forces), and coupled with previous resource denial pressure over time, the Romans were forced to retreat, and the Gallic secured a victory. As one historian notes about the persisting strategy:\n\n:\"But before the defeat at Alesia, Vercingetorix's strategy had driven Cesar from central Gaul.. In finding and overwhelming Roman foragers as Fabius had done to Hannibal's men, the Gauls concentrated against weakness to win many small victories. Their strength in cavalry helped them concentrate rapidly, facilitating the application of the combat element in their strategy, though attacking foragers and grain gatherers were also intrinsic to the logistic aspect of their campaign.\"<ref>Dando-Collins. Caesar's legions. 52\u201368</ref>\n\n====Roman infantry versus mobile and guerilla warfare in Hispania====\n:'''The Iberian zone of struggle.''' The Gallic-Celtic-Iberian peoples, like many other tribes, descended from the general \"Celtic\" race, put up an obstinate fight against Roman hegemony. Based in [[Hispania]] (what is now Spain and Portugal), they fought continuously, with varying levels of intensity, for almost two centuries, beginning around 218 BC. The initial hegemons of Hispania were the Carthaginians who struggled against various tribes to carve out colonies and a commercial empire, primarily in coastal enclaves. Carthaginian defeats by Rome brought struggle against a new imperium. Tribes such as the [[Celtiberi]] carried out a strong resistance, a struggle later continued by other groups such as the [[Lusitani]], under [[Viriathus]]. The [[Lusitanian War]] and the [[Numantine War]] are but a few examples of the prolonged conflict, which cut across 20 decades of Roman history. Full conquest was not achieved until the time of [[Augustus]]. The vicious long-term fighting made Hispania a place of dread for the Roman soldier. Historian Sir Edward Creasy, in his \"[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]\" had this to say about the Iberian conflicts.<ref>[http://www.arthurwendover.com/arthurs/history/tfdbt10.html The Fifteen Decisive Battles Of The World]: From Marathon To Waterloo by Sir Edward Creasy, M.A., 1851</ref>\n\n::\"The war against the Spaniards, who, of all the nations subdued by the Romans, defended their liberty with the greatest obstinacy... the Romans in both provinces were so often beaten, that nothing was more dreaded by the soldiers at home than to be sent there...\n\n:'''Roman tactics.''' Rome deployed its standard methods, with greater emphasis on blended units of light troops, cavalry and heavy infantry when confronting the guerrilla or mobile tactics used by the [[Iberians]]. Roman fortified camps were also valuable in protecting the troops and providing bases of operation. While combat results were mixed in the open field, the Romans did comparatively well when besieging Iberian cities, systematically eliminating enemy leaders, supply bases and centres of resistance. Destruction of Iberian resources by burning grain fields or demolishing villages also put the native resistance under greater pressure. The operations of Scipio during the [[Numantine War]] illustrate these methods, including a crackdown on lax practices and tightening of legionary discipline.<ref name=\"livius.org\">[https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_00.html ''History of Rome: The Spanish Wars'', by Appian, circa 165 A.D.]</ref> Other Roman tactics touched on the political sphere such as the \"pacification\" treaties of Gracchus, and treachery and trickery, as in the massacres of tribal leaders by [[Lucullus]] and [[Galba]] under guise of negotiation. Rome frequently capitalized on divisions among the tribes. A \"divide and conquer\" policy was in use, with competing (and sometimes insincere) treaties being negotiated to isolate targeted groups, and allied tribes being used to subdue others.<ref>Appian, op. cit.</ref>\n\n:'''Celtic-Iberian tactics.''' Fighting for their independence and survival, the Iberian tribes used fortified cities or strongpoints to defend against their enemies and mixed this with mobile warfare in formations ranging from small [[guerrilla]] bands to large units numbering thousands of men. The Celtic/Iberian horsemen, in particular, appear to be more than a match for those of Rome, a fact proved in earlier years by the key role such allied cavalry played in Hannibal's victories. Favourable mobility and knowledge of the local terrain were to help the tribes immensely. One of the most successful ambushes was pulled off by a chieftain named Carus, who liquidated around 6,000 Romans in a combined cavalry-infantry strike. Another was executed by [[Caesarus]], who took advantage of a disorderly Roman pursuit under [[Mummius]], to lay a trap that resulted in Roman losses of around 9,000 men. A similar Iberian \"turn and fight\" gambit is also recorded as being successful against [[Galba]]. Roman arms however triumphed over two grinding centuries of conflict. See ''\"[[Appian]]'s History of Rome: The Spanish Wars\"'' for a more detailed discussion of individual battles, leaders and engagements.<ref name=\"livius.org\"/>\n\n===Victory through attrition===\nIn their battles against a wide variety of opponents, Rome's ruthless persistence, greater resources and stronger organization wore down their opponents over time.<ref>John Warry, Warfare in the classical world, University of Oklahoma Press</ref> Rome's massive manpower supply was the foundation of this approach. Opponents could be relentlessly weakened and exhausted over the long run.<ref>Fronda, 2010. Between Rome and Carthage.. p38</ref> In Spain, resources were thrown at the problem until it yielded over 150 years later\u2014a slow, harsh grind of endless marching, constant sieges and fighting, broken treaties, burning villages and enslaved captives. As long as the Roman Senate and its successors were willing to replace and expend more men and material decade after decade, victory could be bought through a strategy of exhaustion.<ref>Robert Asprey, ''War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History'', Vol 1, Doubleday, 1975, p 21-30</ref>\n\nThe systematic wastage and destruction of enemy economic and human resources were called ''vastatio'' by the Romans. Crops and animals were destroyed or carried off, and local populaces were massacred or enslaved. Sometimes these tactics were also used to conduct punitive raids on barbarian tribes which had performed raids across the border. In the campaigns of Germanicus, Roman troops in the combat area carried out a \"scorched earth\" approach against their Germanic foes, devastating the land they depended on for supplies. ''\"The country was wasted by fire and sword fifty miles round, nor sex nor age found mercy; places sacred and profane had the equal lot of destruction, all razed to the ground..\"'' (Tacitus, ''Annals''). The Roman \"grind down\" approach is also seen in the Bar Kokba Jewish revolt against the Romans. The Roman commander Severus avoided meeting the hard-fighting Jewish rebels in the open field. Instead, he relied on attacking their fortified strongpoints and devastating the zone of conflict in a methodical campaign.<ref>Richard Gottheil, Samuel Krauss, \"Bar-Kokba and The Bar-Kokba War\", ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'', 2002, See also ''Hist. Rom.'' lxix. ch. 12-14 of Dio Cassius for details on the massive Jewish Revolt.</ref> This \"attritional\" aspect of the Roman approach to combat contrasts with the notion of brilliant generalship or tactics sometimes seen in popular depictions of the Roman infantry.\n\nSome historians note however that Rome often balanced brutal attrition with shrewd diplomacy, as demonstrated by Caesar's harsh treatment of Gallic tribes that opposed him, but his sometimes conciliatory handling of those that submitted. Rome also used a variety of incentives to encourage cooperation by the elites of conquered peoples, co-opting opposition and incorporating them into the structure of the empire. This carrot and stick approach forms an integral part of \"the Roman way\" of war.<ref>Archer Jones, ''The Art of War in the Western World'', University of Illinois Press: 1987, pp. 34-92, 267-381</ref>\n\n====Resource tactics====\nAs with any military organization, training soldiers/armies requires a number of things and could prove to be quite costly in the long run. The Romans understood this concept very well and realized that training soldiers could include paying for his rations ''[food]'', his salary, his armour, his armaments ''[weapons]'', and a soldier\u2019s honorarium ''[which was paid to those who received honourable discharges]''. With all this in perspective, they realized each individual soldier was a far too valuable resource to waste. They knew the costs they were incurring for each soldier had to be quite similar on their enemy\u2019s side. So they developed a tactic that could cause a significant setback or even defeat for their enemy while only creating a limited risk for their own soldiers. This was known as \u201cResource Tactics.\u201d Standing armies run on their stomachs and their equipment, and both require regular supplies. \"Resource Tactics\" cut off their opponents from resources in one of three ways:\n\n#Attack resource locations: Once they conquered territory, the Romans would secure as many resources as they could handle. This allowed them to restock their own supply and prevent the available resources from falling into their opponents' hands.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\">http://romanmilitary.net/strategy/resource</ref>\n#Intercept supplies while in transit: The Romans would identify their enemies' main supply routes and create a ''stopping point.'' Once the enemy was stopped, the Romans would ransack the supply, which would drastically reduce the supplies reaching the enemy.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\"/>\n#Conduct a \u201csiege\u201d ''[siege - a military operation in which troops surround a place and cut off all outside access to force surrender]'': The Romans would typically build a wall around the existing city to help control the enemy. This wall would be built out of reach of the archers and would prevent the enemy from escaping. Once the Romans completed the wall, they would use catapults, ballistas and onagers to hurl rocks, spears, and other objects from safe distances. The ongoing siege would eventually cause the city/fort to run out of resources, thus causing the opponents to die off or surrender.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\"/>\n\nThe basic principle behind these tactics was to disrupt their enemies' resources while increasing Roman resources. Without a regular supply of food, water, and other commodities, armies would begin to starve or dehydrate, resulting in low morale or killing of fellow soldiers.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\"/>\n\n===Roman infantry versus cavalry===\n\n====Tactical problems of fighting cavalry====\nCavalry opponents were one of the toughest challenges faced by the Roman infantry. Combining both missile and shock capability with extensive mobility, cavalry exploited the inherent weakness of the legion\u2014its relatively slow movement and deployment. Defeat by strong cavalry forces is a recurring event in Roman military history. The campaigns of Hannibal illustrate this well, as [[Numidian]] and Spanish/Gallic horsemen repeatedly outflanked Roman formations, dealing devastating blows in the sides and rear. Hannibal's great victory at Cannae (considered one of the greatest Roman defeats ever) was primarily an infantry struggle, but the key role was played by his cavalry, as in his other victories.\n\nAn even more dramatic demonstration of Roman vulnerability is shown in the numerous wars against [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] heavy cavalry. The Parthians and their successors used large numbers of fast-moving light riders to harass and skirmish, and delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce with heavily armoured lancers called \"[[cataphract]]s\". Both types of troops used powerful composite bows that shot arrows of sufficient strength to penetrate Roman armour. The cataphracts extended combat power by serving as shock troops, engaging opposing forces with their heavy lances in thundering charges after they had been \"softened up\" by swarms of arrows. The Parthians also conducted a \"scorched earth\" policy against the Romans, refusing major set-piece encounters, while luring them deeper on to the unfavorable ground, where they would lack water supplies and a secure line of retreat. The debacle of the [[Battle of Carrhae]] saw a devastating defeat of Roman arms by the Parthian cavalry.<ref>Denison, ''History of Cavalry'', op. cit</ref> Crassus' force was systematically dismembered by the smaller Parthians army, who surprised Roman expectations that they would run out of arrows, by arranging for a supply train of ammunition borne by thousands of camels.  Roman casualties were approcimately 20,000 killed and 10,000 captured making the battle one of the costliest defeats in Roman history. Parthian casualties were minimal.<ref>Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 31.7.</ref>\n\n====Successful tactics====\nClues exist in the earlier campaigns of Alexander the Great against mounted Asiatic warriors\u2014engaging the horsemen with strong detachments of light infantry and missile troops and driving them off with charges by Alexander's heavy cavalry units. The Roman variant, with its large manpower resources, continued the same \"combined arms\" approach, with a larger role for cavalry as the empire went on. The Eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]], particularly, was ultimately to rely mostly on cavalry forces.\n\n'''Adjustments of Ventidius.''' The operations of the Roman commander [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] illustrate three general tactics used by the infantry to fight their mounted foes. These drew on Caesar's veteran legions and made Ventidius one of the Roman generals to celebrate a triumph against the Parthians. In three separate battles, he not only managed to defeat the Parthian armies and drive them out of the Roman territory but also managed to kill Parthia's three top military commanders during the battles.<ref name=\"Denisonop\">Denison, op. cit</ref> The adjustments of Ventidius were as follows:<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n\n#''Increase in firepower.'' Ventidius sought to neutralize the Parthian advantage in firepower, by adding his own, and provided his legions with numerous slingers whose furious fire was instrumental in checking the Parthian horsemen during several battles. In subsequent engagements, other Roman commanders increased cavalry units and slingers, with the latter being supplied with leaden bullets which gave more range and killing power.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n#''Securing the high ground and other terrain features.'' During movement against the horsemen, special care had to be taken when crossing a mountain, ravine or bridge. In such cases, sub-sections of the legion had to be redeployed to provide covering and blocking forces until the army had safely navigated the route.<ref>Xenophon, ''Anabasis'', Loeb's Classical Library, 1998). See this classic work for a detailed discussion of anti-cavalry problems by another heavy infantry formation- the Hellenic phalanx, including the weaknesses of the hollow square formation</ref> In his three victories over the horsemen, Ventidius had his infantry secure the high ground, bolstering defensive positions and manoeuvres with withering covering fire by the slingers. Seizure of hilly terrain features hindered sweeping enemy cavalry movements, obstructed avenues of attack and provided anchor points that allowed manoeuvring detachments to counterattack, or to fall back if unfavourable conditions developed. Against the horsemen, heavy infantry units had to work closely with cavalry and light troops, and be mutually supporting, or they could be quickly isolated and destroyed.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n# ''Quick counterattack from a stable base.'' Once entering the zone of battle, Ventidius generally operated from a defensive base and did not prematurely venture on to flat terrain or allow his forces to lose cohesion as at Carrhae. He let the Parthian forces come to him after taking a strong position, and aggressively and quickly counterattacked. In two victories the Parthians were induced to attack the army camp, where they were mauled by the corps of slingers. The legions then counterattacked from this defensive anvil, light and heavy units working together to smash opposition.<ref name=\"Persia, Volume 1 1915. pg 385-386\">A history of Persia, Volume 1. 1915. By Sir Percy Molesworth Sykes. pg 385-386</ref> In one victory, Ventidius took a position on the high ground, and then dispatched a strong vanguard of cavalry against a Parthian concentration at the Syrian Gates, or narrow pass over Mount Amanus, leading from Cilicia into Syria. This vanguard was a decoy to lure the opposition forward. As the Parthians moved in for the kill, the Romans ambushed them from the flank with a detachment of slingers and infantry. Rather than wait for reinforcements by the allied force of Labenieus in the area, the Parthians decided to mount a full-scale attach on the main Roman position at dawn. Ventidius held back his forces until most of the Parthians were on the steep slope, then made a fast counterattack - his infantry covered by the slingers. The Parthians were defeated in detail and Pharnapates the Parthian commander was killed. <ref name=\"Persia, Volume 1 1915. pg 385-386\"/>In his third triumph, Ventidius again secured the high ground, the pivot of his tactics, and did not oppose a Parthian crossing of the Euphrartes. He held back his forces and let the Parthians advance to his position until they were close, then ordered a rapid counterattack- the slingers blanketing the enemy with fire, and the infantry surging forward. This quick \"combined arms counter-punch\" caught the Parthians on unfavorable terrain under a furious hail of slingstones and leaden pellets, and prevented them from destroying the legions with arrow barrages from a distance. Forced to fight at close quarters with the quickly advancing legionaires, the Parthians faltered and their leader Pacorus and his body guard were killed. The rest of their army eventually broke and retreated.<ref>Rose Mary Sheldon -2010. Rome\u2019s War in Parthia_ Blood in the Sand-Vallentine Mitchell p 60</ref>\n'''Combined arms and quick advance in later eras.''' In the later Roman empire, cavalry forces played a larger role, with the infantry in support. The campaign of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] against the [[Persia]]ns is instructive in this regard. On June 22, 363 a large-scale clash occurred near the town of Maranga. Facing an enemy that threatened to blanket his troops with a hail of arrows, and in danger of envelopment, Julian deployed his force in a crescent formation, and ordered an advance by both infantry and cavalry on the double, thwarting both dangers by closing quickly. The gambit was successful. After a long battle, the Persians withdrew- a tactical victory (albeit a costly one for the Romans according to some historians).<ref>Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'', (Thames & Hudson, 1986) p. 114-157</ref> The work of Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus offers a detailed description of the Persian campaign, including the quick charge by the heavy Roman infantry under Julian.\n:''\"To prevent the preliminary volleys of the archers from disrupting our ranks he (Julian) advanced at the double and so ruined the effect of their fire... Roman foot in close order made a mighty push and drove the serried ranks of the enemy before them...\"''\nMarcellinus's commentary also sharply contrasts the fighting spirit of the Persian infantrymen with those of Rome, stating that they had \"aversion to pitched infantry battles.\"<ref>Marcellinus, Ammianus, ''The Later Roman Empire'', translated by Hamilton, W. (Penguin, 1987). See also Chris Cornuelle, An Overview of the Sassanian Persian Military, (n.d.) retrieved from May 2008 from Iran Chamber Society http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/overview_sassanian_persian_military2.php</ref> In an earlier engagement outside the walls of Ctesiphon, Marcellinus again notes the value of the quick advance by the infantry:\n:''\"both sides fought hand-to-hand with spears and drawn swords; the quicker our men forced themselves into the enemy's line the less they were exposed to danger from arrows.\"''<ref>Marcellinus, op. cit.</ref>\n\n'''Mixed results against major cavalry enemies.''' Rome's overall record against the Parthians was favourable, although the Parthian horsemen offered stiff resistance, as it was against the horsemen of Hannibal, and some Gallic opponents. Subsequent Roman leaders like Antony invaded Parthian territory but had to withdraw after severe losses. Others like Severus and Trajan saw great success in their invasions of Mesopotamia, defeating Parthian armies through combined arms tactics.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" /> Thus, the battles of Ventidius and Julian show that the Roman infantry, when properly handled and manoeuvred, and when working in conjunction with other supporting arms like slingers, could certainly meet the challenge of an enemy cavalryman.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n\n===Decline===\nAny history of the Roman infantry must grapple with the factors that led to the decline of the heavy legions that once dominated the Western world. Such decline, of course, is closely linked with the decay of other facets of Rome's economy, society and political scene. Nevertheless, some historians emphasize that the final demise of Rome was due to '''military''' defeat, however plausible (or implausible) the plethora of theories advanced by some scholars, ranging from declining tax bases, to class struggle, to mass lead poisoning.<ref>Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', pp. 43-190</ref> Two of the major factors that have occupied scholars of the military will be discussed here: barbarization and the adaptation of a \"mobile reserve\" strategy. There are a number of controversies in this area with duelling scholars advancing competing theories.\n\n====\"Barbarization\" of the heavy infantry====\n\"Barbarization\" is a common theme in many works on Rome (See [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], [[Mommsen]], [[Hans Delbr\u00fcck|Delbr\u00fcck]], et al.), and thus cannot be excluded from any analysis of its infantry forces. Essentially it is argued that the increasing barbarization of the heavy legions weakened weaponry, training, morale and military effectiveness in the long run. The weapons changes described above are but one example.<ref>Arther Ferrill,'' The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'', op. cit.</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that the use of barbarian personnel was nothing new. This is accurate, however, such use was clearly governed by \"the Roman way.\" It was the barbarian personnel who had to adapt to Roman standards and organization, not the other way around. In the twilight of the empire, this was not the case. Such practices as permitting the settlement of massive, armed barbarian populations on Roman territory, the watering down of the privilege of citizenship, increasing use of alien contingents, and relaxation or removal of traditionally thorough and severe Roman discipline, organization and control, contributed to the decline of the heavy infantry.<ref>Ferrill, ''Fall of the Roman Empire 43-190''</ref>\n\nThe settlement of the [[foederati]] for example, saw large barbarian contingents ushered on to Roman territory, with their own organization, under their own leaders. Such groupings showed a tendency to neglect \"the Roman way\" in organization, training, logistics etc., in favour of their own ideas, practices and agendas. These settlements may have bought short-term political peace for imperial elites, but their long-term effect was negative, weakening the traditional strengths of the heavy infantry in discipline, training and deployment. They also seemed to have lessened the incentive for remaining \"old Guard\" troops to adhere to such strengths, since the barbarians received equal or more favour with less effort. Indeed, such \"allied\" barbarian contingents were at times to turn on the Romans, devastating wide areas with sack and pillage and even attacking imperial army formations.<ref>Ferrill, ''Fall of the Roman Empire.. 43-190''</ref> Other writers argue that while some ancient Romans did view the world in terms of barbarians versus civilized Romans (epitomized in Hadrian's Wall of separation), the reality of Roman frontiers was a fuzzy set of interlocking zones - political, military, judicial and financial, rather than a neat linear boundary. Changes to the Roman forces that moved away from the old fighting organization order were thus the outcome of several influences, rather than simply the appearance of more, allegedly uncivilized non-Romans.<ref>Hugh Elton, 2012, Frontiers of the Roman Empire, pg 36-131</ref>\n\n====Changes in the legions====\nTo combat the more frequent raids and advances of their hostile neighbours the legions were changed from slow and heavy to much lighter troops, and cavalry was introduced as a serious concept. State-controlled factories produced vast quantities of less specialist arms such as chainmail armour and spears as opposed to the gladius and lorica segmentata more prevalent in the early empire. The difference between auxiliaries and legionaries began to become negligible from an equipment point of view. This meant that the new subdivided infantry lost the awesome power that the earlier legions had, meaning that whilst they were more likely to see a battle they were less likely to win it. That legion size was at an all-time low was also a factor. On the other hand, legions in the late empire were used far more flexibly as accounts by authors like Ammianus Marcellinus make clear. Smaller detachments waged more personal and smaller scale, yet intense operations against tribal foes on the Rhine and Danubian frontiers. Instead of vast formations of thousands of troops, smaller units would engage smaller-scale incursions by raiders.\n[[Roman horsemen]], while fast, were actually much too weak to cope with the very cavalry based invasions of the Huns, Goths, Vandals and Sassanids. Their ineffectiveness was demonstrated at [[Cannae]] and [[Adrianople]]; in both instances, the cavalry was completely destroyed by a vastly more powerful enemy horse. Advances in Roman tactical thinking led to the adoption of eastern-style cataphracts and mass-use of auxiliary forces as cavalry, both of which were used to address previous shortcomings of the Roman army. The later Roman army was more cavalry-orientated than it had been before and as a result, detachments were able to be moved around the empire at will, ending the previous doctrine of keeping all forces on the frontiers at the edge of the empire.\n\n====The mobile forces approach====\n\nThe \"mobile reserve\" strategy, traditionally identified with [[Constantine I]], saw a reversal of the traditional \"forward\" policy of strong frontier fortifications backed by legions stationed near likely zones of conflict. Instead, it is argued that the best troops were pulled back into a type of \"mobile reserve\" closer to the centre that could be deployed to trouble areas throughout the empire. Some scholars claim this was a positive development, (Luttwak, [[Delbruck]], et al.) given growing difficulties with governing the vast empire, where political turmoil and severe financial difficulties had made the old preclusive security system untenable. Some writers such as Luttwak condemn the old-style \"forward\" policy as indicating a \"[[Maginot Line]]\" mentality in the troubled latter centuries of the Empire.<ref>Edward Luttwak, ''Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', (The Johns Hopkins University Press 1979)</ref>\n\n'''Disadvantages of the mobile reserve strategy versus the \"forward\" policy'''\n\nAncient writers like [[Zosimus]] in the 5th century AD condemned the \"reserve\" policy as a major weakening of the military force. Other modern scholars (Ferrill et al.) also see the pullback as a strategic mistake, arguing that it left lower quality \"second string\" limitanei forces to stop an enemy until the distant mobile reserve arrived. While the drop in quality did not happen immediately, it is argued that over time, the limitanei declined into lightly armed, static watchman type troops that were of dubious value against increasing barbarian marauders on the frontiers. The pullback of the best infantry was based more on political reasons (shoring up the power bases of the emperors and various elites) rather than on military reality. In addition, it is claimed, the \"forward\" policy was not at all a static \"Maginot\" approach, but that traditional heavy legions and supporting cavalry could still move to a trouble spot by redeploying them from fortifications elsewhere along a particular frontier. Some scholars challenge the notion that a \"mobile reserve\" in the modern military sense existed in the Roman Empire, and instead argue that the shifts in an organization represent a series of field armies deployed in various areas as needed, particularly in the East. Others point to the heavy fiscal difficulties and political turmoil of the later Empire that made it difficult to continue a traditional policy.<ref name=\"Ferrillop\">Ferrill, op. cit</ref>\n\n===Twilight of the hard-core infantry===\nThere are numerous other facets to the controversy, but whatever the school of thought, all agree that the traditional strengths and weaponry of the heavy infantry legion declined from the standards of earlier eras. The 4th-century writer [[Vegetius]], in one of the most influential Western military works ''[[De Re Militari]]'', highlighted this decline as the key factor in military weakness, noting that the core legions always fought as part of an integrated team of cavalry and light foot. In the latter years, this formula that had brought so much success petered out. Caught between the growth of lighter armed/less organized foot soldiers, and the increasing cavalry formations of the mobile forces, the \"heavies\" as the dominant force, withered on the vine. This does not mean that heavy units disappeared entirely, but that their mass recruitment, formation, organization and deployment as the dominant part of the Roman military was greatly reduced. Ironically, in Rome's final battles (the Western half of the empire) the defeats suffered were substantially inflicted by infantry forces (many fighting dismounted).<ref name=\"Ferrillop\" />\n\nSpeaking of the decline of the heavy infantry, the Roman historian [[Vegetius]] lauded the old fighting units, and lamented how the heavy armour of the early days had been discarded by the weaker, less disciplined, barbarized forces:\n:''\"Those who find the old arms so burdensome, must either receive wounds upon their naked bodies and die, or what is worse still, run the risk of being made prisoners, or of betraying the country by their flight. Thus, to avoid fatigue, they allow themselves to be butchered shamefully, like cattle.\"''<ref>Quoted in Denison, p. 92</ref>\n\nHistorian Arther Ferrill notes that even towards the end, some of the old infantry formations were still in use. Such grouping was increasingly ineffective, however, without the severe close order discipline, drill and organization of old times.<ref name=\"Ferrillop\" /> At the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] (circa 451 AD) [[Attila the Hun]] rallied his troops by mocking the once-vaunted Roman infantry, alleging that they merely huddled under a screen of protective shields in close formation. He ordered his troops to ignore them and to attack the powerful [[Alans]] and [[Visigoths]] instead. It was a sad commentary on the force that had once dominated Europe, the Mediterranean and much of the Middle East. It is true that at Ch\u00e2lons, the Roman infantry contributed to the victory by seizing part of the battlefield's high ground. Nevertheless, its day had already passed in favour of the mass levies of the barbarian federates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Assessment of the Roman infantry===\n\n====Central factors in Roman success====\nSome elements that made the Romans an effective military force, both tactically and at higher levels, were:\n\n'''The Romans were able to copy and adapt the weapons and methods of their opponents more effectively.''' Some weapons, such as the [[gladius]], were adopted outright by the legionaries. Publius asserts that the ''pilum'' was of Samnite origin, and the shield was based on Greek design.<ref>Grimal, op. cit</ref> In other cases, especially formidable units of enemy forces were invited to serve in the Roman army as auxiliaries after peace was made. In the naval sphere, the Romans followed some of the same methods they used with the infantry, dropping their ineffective designs and copying, adapting and improving on Punic warships, and introducing heavier marine contingents (infantry fighters) on to their ships.<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, The Punic Wars, 98-162\">Goldsworthy, The Punic Wars, 98-162</ref>\n\n'''Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents.''' Compared to the tightly packed spearmen of the phalanx, the Roman heavy infantry, through their training and discipline, and operating in conjunction with light foot and cavalry, could quickly adopt a number of methods and formations depending on the situation. These range from the [[Testudo formation]] during [[siege warfare]], to a hollow square against cavalry attack, to mixed units of heavy foot, horse and light infantry against guerrillas in Spain, to the classic \"triple line\" or checkerboard patterns. Against more sophisticated opponents the Romans also showed great flexibility at times, such as the brilliant adjustments Scipio made against Hannibal at Zama. These included leaving huge gaps in the ranks to trap the charging elephants, and the recall, reposition and consolidation of a single battle line that advanced to the final death struggle against the Carthaginian veterans of Italy.<ref>Goldsworthy, op. cit</ref>\n\n'''Roman discipline, organization and logistical systemization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period.''' Notably, the Roman system of ''[[castra]]'', or fortified camps, allowed the army to stay in the field on favourable ground and be rested and resupplied for battle. Well organized Roman logistics also sustained combat power, from routine resupply and storage to the construction of military roads, to state-run [[arsenal]]s and weapons factories, to well organized naval convoys that helped stave off defeat by [[Carthage]]. The death of a leader generally did not cause the legions to lose heart in battle. Others stepped to the fore and carried on. In the defeat by Hannibal at the [[Trebbia River|River Trebia]], 10,000 Romans cut their way through the debacle to safety, maintaining [[unit cohesion]] when all around was rout, a testimony to their tactical organization and discipline.<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, The Punic Wars, 98-162\"/>\n\n'''The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents.''' Unlike other civilizations, the Romans kept going relentlessly until typically their enemies had been completely crushed or neutralized. The army acted to implement policy and were not allowed to stop unless they received a command from the emperor or a decree from the senate.\n\nAgainst the tribal polities of Europe, particularly in [[Hispania]], Roman tenacity and material weight eventually wore down most opposition. The tribes of Europe did not have a state or economic structure able to support lengthy campaigns and therefore could often (but not always) be made to change their minds about opposing Roman hegemony. The defeat in the Teutoburg Forest might seem like an exception, but even here, the Romans were back on the warpath 5 years later with major forces against their Germanic opponents. That their persistence was not actually endless does not negate the general pattern.\n\nWhere the Romans faced another large state structure, such as the Parthian Empire, they found the military road rocky indeed and were sometimes forced to an impasse. Nevertheless, the distinct pattern of Roman tenacity holds. Rome suffered its greatest defeats against sophisticated Carthage, notably at Cannae, and was forced to avoid a battle for a lengthy period. Yet in time, it rebuilt its forces on land and at sea, and persisted in the struggle, astonishing the Punics who expected it to sue for peace. Against the Parthians, crushing defeats did not stop the Romans from inflicting serious defeats on the Parthians themselves, for they invaded [[Parthia]]n territory several times afterwards, and though Parthia proper was never totally conquered, Rome ultimately secured a rough hegemony in the area and managed to successfully destroy Parthian forces in Mesopotamia on numerous occasions.\n\n'''Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.''' Leadership debacles are common in Roman military history, from the routs against Hannibal to the demise of the unlucky [[Crassus]] against the Parthians. The Roman polity's structuring, however, produced a steady supply of men willing and able to lead troops in battle- men that were held accountable for defeat or malfeasance. It was not unusual for a losing general to be prosecuted by political enemies in Rome, with some having their property confiscated and barely escaping death. The senatorial oligarchy, for all its political manoeuvring, interference and other faults, provided the functions of oversight and audit over military matters, that over the course of time, shaped final results. The record is a mixed one, but whether under boisterous [[Republic]] or Imperial emperor, Rome produced enough competent leaders to secure its military dominance for over a millennium. Some of the best leaders come from both eras, including Marius, Sulla, Scipio, Caesar, Trajan and others.\n\nNote should be taken here of a large number of junior officers the Romans typically used to assure coordination and guidance. The initiative of such men played a key part in Roman success. Effective leadership was also bound up with the famous Roman [[centurion]]s, the backbone of the legionary organization. While not all such men could be considered models of perfection, they commanded substantial respect.\n\n'''Rome's massive manpower supply enabled it to stay in the field and continue fighting after defeats and to launch new campaigns.''' Against Hannibal for example, Rome suffered huge losses, but still vastly outnumbered Hannibal's forces. This meant not only defensive operations under Fabius but the aggressive deployment of new armies under Scipio to take the battle to the Carthaginians in Africa. Other enemies of Rome came up against this massive manpower reserve and faltered over time - from small tribes, city-states or kingdoms fighting to maintain their independence, to major empires that confronted the Romans. The huge pool of fighting men gave the Romans much more room for error or setbacks, compared to their opponents.<ref>Michael Fronda (2010) Between Rome and Carthage.. p. 38</ref>\n\n'''The influence of the Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.''' Such culture included but was not limited to: (a) the valuing of Roman citizenship, (b) the broad-based muster of free males into mass infantry units (as opposed to widespread use of foreign contingents, [[slave]]s or mercenaries), and (c) loyalty to those fighting units (the Legion) which remained characteristically Roman in outlook and discipline. Citizenship conveyed certain valuable rights in Roman society, and was another element that helped to promote the standardization and integration of the infantry.<ref>Grimal, ''The Civilization of Rome'', p. 98-102</ref> The citizen under arms - the legion soldier - was supposed to reflect and practice the Roman ideal of ''virtus, pietas, fides'', - self-discipline, respect and faithfulness to engagements. Implementation of such ideals could be mixed according to some writers, but it was \"a trilogy [driving] every aspect of military, domestic, economic and social life.\"<ref>Grimal, p. 104</ref> As such it was a strong force for cohesion among Rome's infantrymen.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Campaign history of the Roman military]]\n* ''[[Castra]]''\n* [[List of Ancient Rome-related topics]]\n* [[Military history of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Roman legion]]\n* [[Roman military personal equipment]]\n* [[Structure of the Roman military]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n;Primary sources\n* Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''\n* Vegetius's ''[[De Re Militari]]''\n* ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''\n\n;Secondary sources\n*'Later Roman Battle Tactics' in C.

It does not attempt detailed coverage of things like army structure or equipment. Various battles are summarized to illustrate Roman methods with links to detailed articles on individual encounters. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Evolution==\nRoman [[military tactics]] and [[strategy]] evolved from that type of a small tribal host-seeking local hegemony to massive operations encompassing a world [[empire]]. This advance was affected by changing trends in Roman political, social and economic life, and that of the larger Mediterranean world, but it was also undergirded by a distinctive \"Roman way\" of war. This approach included a tendency towards standardization and systematization, practical borrowing, copying and adapting from outsiders, flexibility in tactics and methods, a strong sense of discipline, a ruthless persistence that sought comprehensive victory, and a cohesion brought about by the idea of [[Roman citizenship]] under arms \u2013 embodied in the [[Roman legion|legion]].<ref>John Warry, ''Warfare in the Ancient World'', (St. Martin's, 1980), pp. 70\u2013193</ref> These elements waxed and waned over time, but they form a distinct basis underlying Rome's rise.\n\nSome key phases of this [[evolution]] throughout Rome's [[military]] history include:<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003 pp. 18\u2013117</ref>\n\n* Military forces based primarily on heavy citizen infantry with tribal beginnings and early use of phalanx-type elements (see [[Military establishment of the Roman kingdom]])\n* Growing sophistication as Roman hegemony expanded outside Italy into North Africa, Greece and the Middle East (see [[Military establishment of the Roman Republic]])\n* Continued refinement, standardization and streamlining in the period associated with [[Gaius Marius]] including broader-based incorporation of more citizenry into the army, and more professionalism and permanence in army service\n* Continued expansion, flexibility and sophistication from the end of the [[republic]] into the time of the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] (see [[Military establishment of the Roman Empire]])\n* Growing barbarization, turmoil and weakening of the heavy infantry units in favour of [[cavalry]] and lighter troops (see ''[[Foederati]]'')\n* Demise of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] and fragmentation into smaller, weaker local forces. This included the reversal of status of cavalry and infantry in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]]. ''[[Cataphract]]'' forces formed an elite, with infantry being reduced to auxiliaries.\n\n==Manpower==\nNumerous scholarly histories of the Roman military machine note the huge numbers of men that could be mobilized, more than any other Mediterranean power. This bounty of military resources enabled Rome to apply crushing pressure to its enemies, and stay in the field and replace losses, even after suffering setbacks. One historian of the Second Punic War states:\n\n{{quote|According to Polybius (2.24), the total number of Roman and allied men capable of bearing arms in 225&nbsp;BC exceeded 700,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalries. Brunt adjusted Polybius\u2019 figures and estimated that the population of Italy, not including Greeks and Bruttians, exceeded 875,000 free adult males, from whom the Romans could levy troops. Rome not only had the potential to levy vast numbers of troops but did in fact field large armies in the opening stages of the war. Brunt estimates that Rome mobilized 108,000 men for service in the legions between 218&nbsp;BC and 215&nbsp;BC, while at the height of the war effort (214&nbsp;BC to 212&nbsp;BC) [against Hannibal] Rome was able to mobilize approximately 230,000 men. Against these mighty resources Hannibal led from Spain an army of approximately 50,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry&nbsp;... Rome's manpower reserves allowed it to absorb staggering losses yet still continue to field large armies. For example, according to Brunt, as many as 50,000 men were lost between 218&nbsp;BC and 215&nbsp;BC, but Rome continued to place between 14 and 25 legions in the field for the duration of the war. Moreover, as will be discussed below, Roman manpower allowed for the adoption of the so-called \"Fabian strategy\", which proved to be an effective response to Hannibal's apparent battlefield superiority. Put simply, the relative disparity in the number of available troops at the outset of the conflict meant that Hannibal had a much narrower margin for error than the Romans.<ref>Michael Fronda (2010). ''Between Rome and Carthage: Southern Italy during the Second Punic War''. p. 38</ref>}}\n\n==Equipment and training==\n{{further|Roman military personal equipment|Roman legion}}\n\n===Equipment===\n\n====Individual weapons, personal equipment and haulage====\nA legionary typically carried around 27 kilograms (60 pounds) of armour, weapons, and equipment. This load consisted of armour, a sword, called a ''[[gladius]]'', a shield, two ''[[Pilum|pila]]'' (one heavy, one light) and 15 days' food rations. There were also tools for digging and constructing a ''[[castra]]'', the legions' fortified base camp. One writer recreates the following as to Caesar's army in Gaul:<ref>Colleen McCullough, (2003) Caesar, p 303-417</ref> Each soldier arranged his heavy pack on a T or Y-shaped rod, borne on his left shoulder. Shields were protected on the march with a hide cover. Each legionary carried about 5 days' worth of wheat, pulses or chickpeas, a flask of oil, and a mess kit with a dish, cup, and utensil. Personal items might include a dyed horsehair crest for the helmet, a semi-water-resistant oiled woollen cloak, socks and breeches for cold weather and a blanket. Entrenchment equipment included a shallow wicker basket for moving earth, a spade and/or pick-axe like ''[[dolabra]]'' or turf cutter, and two wooden staves to construct the next camp palisade. All these were arranged in the marching pack toted by each infantryman.\n\nFighters travelled in groups of eight, and each octet was sometimes assigned a mule. The mule carried a variety of equipment and supplies, including a mill for grinding grain, a small clay oven for baking bread, cooking pots, spare weapons, waterskins, and tents. A Roman century had a complement of 10 mules, each attended by two non-combatants who handled foraging and water supply. A century might be supported by wagons in the rear, each drawn by six mules, and carrying tools, nails, water barrels, extra food and the tent and possessions of the centurion- commanding officer of the unit.\n\n====Artillery package====\nThe legion also carried an artillery detachment with 30 pieces of artillery. This consisted of 10 stone-throwing [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]]s and 20 bolt-shooting [[ballista]]s; in addition, each of the legion's centuries had its own [[Scorpio (weapon)|scorpio]] bolt thrower (60 total), together with supporting wagons to carry ammunition and spare parts. Bolts were used for targeted fire on human opponents, while stones were used against fortifications or as an area saturation weapon. The catapults were powered by rope and sinew, tightened by a ratchet and released, powered by the stored torsion energy. Caesar was to mount these in boats on some operations in Britain, striking fear in the heart of the native opponents according to his writings. His placement of siege engines and bolt throwers in the towers and along the wall of his enclosing fortifications at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] were critical to turning back the enormous tide of Gauls. These defensive measures, used in concert with the cavalry charge led by Caesar himself, broke the Gauls and won the battle\u2014and therefore the war\u2014for good. Bolt-throwers like the Scorpio were mobile and could be deployed in defence of camps, field entrenchments and even in the open field by no more than two or three men.<ref>Rome at war. (2005) Gilliver et al. Osprey, p 63\u201397</ref>\n\n===Training===\n\nOver time the military system changed its equipment and roles, but throughout the course of Roman history, it always remained a disciplined and professional war machine. Soldiers carried out training common to every organized army, from initial muster, arms and weapons drill, formation marching and tactical exercises.\n\nAccording to [[Vegetius]], during the four-month initial training of a Roman legionary, marching skills were taught before recruits ever handled a weapon, since any formation would be split up by stragglers at the back or soldiers trundling along at differing speeds.<ref name=\"roman-empire.net\">http://www.roman-empire.net/army/training.html</ref> Standards varied over time, but normally recruits were first required to complete 20 Roman miles (29.62&nbsp;km or 18.405 modern miles) with 20.5&nbsp;kg in five summer hours (the Roman day was divided into 12 hours regardless of season, as was the night), which was known as \"the regular step\" or \"military pace\".<ref name=\"therthdimension.org\">http://www.therthdimension.org/AncientRome/Roman_Army/Training/training.htm</ref> They then progressed to the \"faster step\" or \"full pace\"<ref name=\"therthdimension.org\"/> and were required to complete 24 Roman miles (35.544&nbsp;km or 22.086 modern miles) in five summer hours loaded with 20.5 kilograms (45&nbsp;lb). The typical conditioning regime also included gymnastics and swimming to build physical strength and fitness.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Complete Roman Army'', Thames & Hudson, 2003, pp. 72\u2013186</ref>\n\nAfter conditioning, the recruits underwent weapons training; this was deemed of such importance that weapons instructors generally received double rations.<ref name=\"roman-empire.net\"/> Legionaries were trained to thrust with their ''gladii'' because they could defend themselves behind their large shields (''[[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]'') while stabbing the enemy. These training exercises began with thrusting a wooden ''[[gladius]]'' and throwing wooden ''[[pilum|pila]]'' into a [[quintain (jousting)|quintain]] (wooden dummy or stake) while wearing full [[Roman armor|armor]]. Their wooden swords and ''pila'' were designed to be twice as heavy as their metal counterparts so that the soldiers could wield a true ''gladius'' with ease. Next, soldiers progressed to ''armatura'', a term for sparring that was also used to describe the similar one-on-one training of [[gladiator]]s. Unlike earlier training, the wooden weapons used for ''armatura'' were the same weight as the weapons they emulated. Vegetius notes that roofed halls were built to allow for these drills to continue throughout the winter.<ref name=\"roman-empire.net\"/>\n\nOther training exercises taught the legionary to obey commands and assume battle formations.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\">Goldsworthy, ''The Complete Roman Army'', op. cit.</ref> At the end of training the legionary had to swear an oath of loyalty to the [[SPQR]] ({{lang|la|Senatus Populusque Romanus}}, the senate and the Roman people) or later to the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]]. The soldier was then given a [[Military diploma|diploma]] and sent off to fight for his living and the glory and honour of Rome.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\" />\n\n==Organization, leadership and logistics==\n\n===Command, control and structure===\n\nOnce the soldier had finished his training he was typically assigned to a [[Roman legion|legion]], the basic mass fighting force. The legion was split into ten sub-units called [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], roughly comparable to a modern infantry battalion. The cohorts were further sub-divided into three ''[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]'', which in turn were split into two [[Centuria|centuries]] of about 80\u2013100 men each. The first cohort in a legion was usually the strongest, with the fullest personnel complement and with the most skilled, experienced men. Several legions grouped together made up a distinctive field force or \"army\".<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\" /> Fighting strength could vary but generally a legion was made up of 4,800 soldiers, 60 centurions, 300 artillerymen, and 100 engineers and artificers, and 1,200 non-combatants. Each legion was supported by a unit of 300 cavalries, the ''equites''.\n\nSupreme command of either legion or army was by [[Roman consul|consul]] or [[proconsul]] or a ''[[praetor]]'', or in cases of emergency in the republican era, a [[Roman Dictator|dictator]]. A ''[[praetor]]'' or a ''[[propraetor]]'' could only command a single legion and not a consular army, which normally consisted of two legions plus the allies. In the early republican period, it was customary for an army to have dual commands, with different consuls holding the office on alternate days. In later centuries this was phased out in favour of one overall army commander. The ''[[Legatus|legati]]'' were officers of senatorial rank who assisted the supreme commander. [[Tribunes]] were young men of aristocratic rank who often supervised administrative tasks like camp construction. [[Centurion (Roman army)|Centurions]] (roughly equivalent in rank to today's non-commissioned or junior officers, but functioning as modern captains in field operations) commanded cohorts, ''maniples'' and centuries. Specialist groups like [[engineers]] and artificers were also used.\n\n====Military structure and ranks====\nFor an in-depth analysis of ranks, types, and historical units, see [[Structural history of the Roman military]] and [[Roman legion]] for a detailed breakdown. Below is a very basic summary of the legion's structure and ranks.<ref>Albert Harkness, ''The Military System of the Romans'', University Press of the Pacific, 2004, pp. 53\u201389</ref>\n\n=====Force structure=====\n* ''Contubernium'': \"tent unit\" of eight men\n* ''Centuria'': 80 men commanded by a centurion\n* Cohort: six centuries or a total of 480 fighting men. Added to these were officers. The first cohort was double strength in terms of manpower and generally held the best fighting men.\n* Legion: made up of 10 cohorts\n* Field army: a grouping of several legions and auxiliary cohorts\n* ''Equites'': Each legion was supported by 300 cavalry (''equites''), sub-divided into ten ''turmae''\n* ''Auxilia'' and ''velites'': allied contingents, often providing light infantry and specialist fighting services, like archers, slingers or javelin-men. They were usually formed into the light infantry or ''velites''. ''Auxilia'' in the republican period also formed allied heavy legions to complement Roman citizen formations.\n* Non-combatant support: generally the men who tended the mules, forage, watering and sundries of the baggage train\n* 4,500\u20135,200 men in a legion\n\n=====Rank summary=====\n*Consul \u2013 an elected official with military and civic duties; like a co-president (there were two), but also a major military commander\n*''Praetor'' \u2013 appointed military commander of a legion or grouping of legions, also a government official\n*''[[Legatus legionis]]'' \u2013 the legate or overall legion commander, usually filled by a senator\n*Tribune \u2013 young officer, second in command of the legion.

Heavy equipment and material (tents, [[artillery]], extra weapons and equipment, millstones etc.) were moved by pack animal and cart, while troops carried weighty individual packs with them, including staves and shovels for constructing the fortified camps. Typical of all armies, local opportunities were also exploited by troops on the spot, and the fields of peasant farmers who were near the zone of conflict might be stripped to meet army needs. As with most armed forces, a variety of traders, hucksters, [[prostitute]]s and other [[Train (military)|miscellaneous service providers]] trailed in the wake of the Roman fighting men.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Initial preparations and movement for battle===\n\n'''The approach march.''' Once the legion was deployed on an operation, the marching began. The approach to the battlefield was made in several columns, enhancing manoeuvrability. Typically a strong vanguard preceded the main body and included scouts, cavalry and light troops. A tribune or other officer often accompanied the vanguard to survey the terrain for possible camp locations. Flank and reconnaissance elements were also deployed to provide the usual covering security. Behind the vanguard came the main body of heavy infantry. Each legion marched as a distinct formation and was accompanied by its own baggage train. The last legion usually provided the rear force, although several recently raised units might occupy this final echelon.\n\n'''Construction of fortified camps.''' Legions on a campaign typically established a strong field camp, complete with [[palisade]] and a deep ditch, providing a basis for supply storage, troop marshalling and defence. Camps were recreated each time the army moved and were constructed with a view to both military necessity and religious symbolism. There were always four gateways, connected by two main crisscrossing streets, with the intersection at a concentration of command tents in the centre. Space was also made for an altar and religious gathering area. Everything was standardized, from the positioning of baggage, equipment and specific army units, to the duties of officers who were to set up sentries, pickets and orders for the next day's march. Construction could take between 2 and 5 hours with part of the army labouring, while the rest stood guard, depending on the tactical situation. The shape of the camp was generally rectangular but could vary based on the terrain or tactical situation. A distance of about 60 meters was left clear between the entrenchments and the first row of troop tents. This gap provided space for marshalling the legionnaires for battle and kept the troop area out of enemy missile range.<ref>Pierre Grimal, ''The Civilization of Rome'', op. cit</ref> No other ancient army persisted over such a long period in systematic camp construction like the Romans, even if the army rested for only a single day.<ref>John Warry, ''Warfare in the ancient World'', (St. Martin's, 1980), pp. 70-183</ref>\n\n'''Breaking camp and marching'''. After a regimented breakfast at the allocated time, trumpets were sounded and the camp's tents and huts were dismantled and preparations made for departure. The trumpet then sounded again with the signal for \"stand by to march\". [[Mule]]s and wagons of the baggage train would be loaded and units formed up. The camp would then be burned to the ground to prevent its later occupation and use by the enemy. The [[trumpet]]s would then be sounded for a final time and then the troops were asked three times whether they were ready, to which they were expected to shout together \"Ready!\", before marching off.<ref>Williamson, G. A., (tr), Josephus, ''The Jewish War'', Penguin Books, 1959, p. 378-179</ref>\n\n'''Intelligence.''' Good Roman commanders did not hesitate to exploit useful [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], particularly where a siege situation or impending clash in the field was developing. Information was gathered from spies, collaborators, diplomats and envoys, and allies. Intercepted messages during the [[Second Punic War]] for example were an intelligence coup for the Romans, and enabled them to dispatch two armies to find and destroy [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]]'s Carthaginian force, preventing his reinforcement of Hannibal. Commanders also kept an eye on the situation in Rome since political enemies and rivals could use an unsuccessful campaign to inflict painful career and personal damage. During this initial phase, the usual field [[reconnaissance]] was also conducted - patrols might be sent out, raids mounted to probe for weaknesses, prisoners snatched, and local inhabitants intimidated.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\">Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', (Cassell 2001) pp. 43\u201378</ref>\n\n'''Morale.''' If the field of potential battle were near, the movement became more careful and more tentative. Several days might be spent in a location studying the terrain and opposition, while the troops were prepared mentally and physically for battle. Pep talks, sacrifices to the gods and the announcements of good [[omen]]s might be carried out. A number of practical demonstrations might also be undertaken to test enemy reaction as well as to build troop morale. Part of the army might be led out of the camp and drawn up in battle array towards the enemy. If the enemy refused to come out and at least make a demonstration, the commander could claim a moral advantage for his men, contrasting the timidity of the opposition with the resolution of his fighting forces.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\"/>\n\nHistorian Adrian Goldsworthy notes that such tentative pre-battle manoeuvring was typical of ancient armies as each side sought to gain the maximum advantage before the encounter.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 50-69\">Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', (Cassell 2001) p. 50-69</ref> During this period, some ancient writers paint a picture of meetings between opposing commanders for negotiation or general discussion, as with the famous pre-clash conversation between [[Hannibal]] and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]]. It's unknown if the recorded flowery speeches are non-fiction, but these encounters don't show a record of resolving the conflict by means other than the anticipated battle.\n\n===Deployment for combat===\nPre-battle manoeuvre gave the competing commanders a feel for the impending clash, but final outcomes could be unpredictable, even after the start of hostilities. Skirmishing could get out of hand, launching both main forces towards one another. Political considerations, exhaustion of supplies, or even rivalry between commanders for glory could also spark a forward launch, as at the [[Battle of the Trebia River]].<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 43-78\"/> The Roman army after the [[Marian reforms]] was also unique in the ancient world because when lined up opposite an enemy readying for battle it was completely silent except for the orders of officers and the sound of trumpets signalling orders. The reason for this was because the soldiers needed to be able to hear such instruction, the [[Optios]] of the Legions would patrol behind the century and anyone who was talking or failing to obey orders immediately was struck with the stick of the optio. This silence also had the unintended consequence of being very intimidating to its enemies because they recognized this took immense discipline to achieve before a battle.\n\n====Layout of the triple line====\n<!-- {{noredirect|Triplex acies}} redirects here -->\nOnce the machinery was in motion however, the Roman infantry typically was deployed, as the main body, facing the enemy. During deployment in the Republican era, the maniples were commonly arranged in ''triplex acies'' (triple battle order): that is, in three ranks, with the [[hastati]] in the first rank (that nearest the enemy), the [[principes]] in the second rank, and the veteran ''[[triarii]]'' in the third and final rank as [[barrier troops]], or sometimes even further back as a strategic reserve. When in danger of imminent defeat, the first and second lines, the hastati and principes, ordinarily fell back on the ''triarii'' to reform the line to allow for either a counter-attack or an orderly withdrawal. Because falling back on the ''triarii'' was an act of desperation, to mention \"falling on the triarii\" (''\"ad triarios rediisse\"'') became a common Roman phrase indicating one to be in a desperate situation.<ref>Warry, ''Warfare in the Ancient World'', op. cit</ref>\n\nWithin this triplex acies system, contemporary Roman writers talk of the maniples adopting a checkered formation called ''[[quincunx]]'' when deployed for battle but not yet engaged. In the first line, the hastati left modest gaps between each maniple. The second line consisting of principes followed in a similar manner, lining up behind the gaps left by the first line.<ref>Taylor, Michael J. (2014). \"Roman Infantry Tactics in the Mid-Republic: A Reevaluation\". ''Historia'' 63, 301\u2013322.</ref> This was also done by the third line, standing behind the gaps in the second line. The velites were deployed in front of this line in a continuous, loose-formation line.<ref>See Polybius, ''The Histories'' for original commentary, ''The Histories'' or ''The Rise of the Roman Empire'' by Polybius: ** At [[Perseus Project]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+toc English & Greek version]</ref>\n\nThe Roman manoeuvre was a complex one, filled with the dust of thousands of soldiers wheeling into place, and the shouting of officers moving to and from as they attempted to maintain order. Several thousand men had to be positioned from column into line, with each unit taking its designated place, along with light troops and cavalry. The fortified camps were laid out and organized to facilitate deployment. It might take some time for the final array of the host, but when accomplished the army's grouping of legions represented a formidable fighting force, typically arranged in three lines with a frontage as long as one mile (about 1.5&nbsp;km<!-- The Roman mile was slightly shorter than the modern imperial mile, see [[Mile#Roman mile]] -->).<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_a\">Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', op. cit</ref>\n\nA general three-line deployment was to remain over the centuries, although the [[Marian reforms]] phased out most divisions based on age and class, standardized weapons and reorganized the legions into bigger manoeuvre units like cohorts. The overall size of the legion and length of the soldier's service also increased on a more permanent basis.<ref>[http://romans.etrusia.co.uk/roman_army_print Wake, T., \"The Roman Army After Marius' Reforms\", 28 February 2006.]</ref>\n\n====Maneuvering====\n[[Image:Rom-mnpl-1.png|frame|center]]\nAs the army approached its enemy, the [[velites]] in front would throw their javelins at the enemy and then retreat through the gaps in the lines. This was an important innovation since in other armies of the period skirmishers would have to either retreat through their own army's ranks, causing confusion or else to flee around either flank of their own army. After the velites had retreated through the hastati, the 'posterior' century would march to the left and then forward so that they presented a solid line, creating a solid line of soldiers. The same procedure would be employed as they passed through the second and third ranks or turned to the side to channel down the gap between the first and second rows on route to help guard the legion's flanks.<ref>Harkness, ''The Roman Military System'', op. cit</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rom-mnpl-2.png|frame|center]]\n\nAt this point, the legion then presented a solid line to the enemy and the legion was in the correct formation for engagement. When the enemy closed, the hastati would charge. If they were losing the fight, the 'posterior' century returned to its position creating gaps again. Then the maniples would fall back through the gaps in the principes, who followed the same procedure to form a battle line and charge. If the principes could not break the enemy, they would retreat behind the ''triarii'' and the whole army would leave the battlefield in good order. According to some writers, the ''triarii'' formed a continuous line when they deployed, and their forward movement allowed scattered or discomfited units to rest and reform, to later rejoin the struggle.<ref>Pierre Brimal, ''The Civilization of Rome'', Simon and Schuster: 1963, Chap 5: ''The Conquerors'', pg 162\u2013196</ref>\n\nThe manipular system allowed engaging every kind of enemy even in rough terrain, because the legion had both flexibility and toughness according to the deployment of its lines. Lack of a strong cavalry corps, however, was a major flaw of the Roman forces.\n\nIn the later imperial army, the general deployment was very similar, with the cohorts deploying in quincunx pattern. In a reflection of the earlier placement of the veteran ''triarii'' in the rear, the less experienced cohorts - usually the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th - were in the front; the more experienced cohorts - 1st, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th - were placed behind.<ref>Warry, op. cit.</ref>\n\n====Formations====\nThe above is only standard procedure and was often modified; for example, at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]], Scipio deployed his entire legion in a single line to envelop [[Hannibal]]'s army just as Hannibal had done at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. A brief summary of alternative formations known to have been used is shown below:\n\n[[Image:Mpl-frm-variations.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Combat===\n'''Hand-to-hand engagement after the release of missile weapons:''' Once the deployment and initial skirmishing described above took place, the main body of heavy infantry closed the gap and attacked the double. The front ranks usually cast their [[Pilum|pila]], and the following ranks hurled theirs over the heads of the front-line fighters. After the pila were cast, the soldiers then drew their swords and engaged the enemy. Emphasis was on using the shield to provide maximum body coverage, and for pushing enemies, while attacking with their [[gladius]] in thrusts and short cuts in [[Clinch fighting|clinch]], minimizing exposure to the enemy. In the combat that ensued, Roman discipline, heavy shield, armour and training were to give them important advantages in combat.\n\n'''The acute shock of combat:''' Some scholars of the Roman infantry maintain that the intense [[Physical trauma|trauma]] and stress of hand-to-hand combat meant that the contenders did not simply hack at one another continuously until one dropped. Instead, there were short periods of intense, vicious fighting. If indecisive, the contenders might fall back a short distance to recuperate, and then surge forward to renew the struggle. Others behind them would be stepping up into the fray meanwhile, engaging new foes or covering their colleagues. The individual warrior could thus count on temporary relief, rather than endless fighting until death or crippling injury. As the battle progressed, the massive physical and mental stress intensified. The stamina and willpower demanded to make yet one more charge, to make yet one more surge grew even greater.<ref name=\"Adrian Goldsworthy 2001 p. 50-69\"/> Eventually one side began to break down, and it is then that the greatest slaughter began.\n\n'''Use of war machines and covering fire:''' Many Roman battles, especially during the late empire, were fought with the preparatory fire from [[catapult]]s, [[ballista]]s and [[Onager (weapon)|onagers]]. These war machines, a form of ancient [[artillery]], fired arrows and large stones towards the enemy (although many historians question the battlefield effectiveness of such weapons). Following this barrage, the Roman infantry advanced, in four lines, until they came within 30 meters of the enemy, then they halted, hurled their pila and charged. If the first line was repelled by the enemy, another line would rapidly resume the attack. Often this rapid sequence of deadly attacks proved the key to victory. Another common tactic was to taunt the enemy with feigned charges and rapid arrow fire by the ''auxiliares equites'' (auxiliary cavalry), forcing the enemy into pursuing them, and then leading the enemy into an ambush where they would be counterattacked by Roman heavy infantry and cavalry.\n\n===3-line system advantages===\n\n====Flexibility====\nSome ancient sources such as [[Polybius]] seem to imply that the legions could fight with gaps in their lines. Yet, most sources seem to admit that more usually a line would form into a solid front. Various approaches have been taken to reconcile these possibilities with the ancient writings.<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy, ''The Roman Army at War, 100 BC- AD200'', (Oxford, 1996), pp. 179-80</ref> The advantages of gaps are obvious when a formation is on the move- it can more easily flow around obstacles and manoeuvre and control are enhanced and, as the Romans did in the pre-Marius republic, place baggage between the lines meaning that the cargo cannot be easily captured and that the army can quickly get ready for a battle by using it as cover. After the approach marching was complete, it would be extremely difficult to deploy an unbroken army of men for combat across any but the flattest ground without some sort of intervals. Many ancient armies used gaps of some sort, even the [[Carthaginians]], who typically withdrew their initial skirmishing troops between the spaces before the main event. Even more loosely organized enemies like the Germanic hosts typically charged in distinct groups with small gaps between them, rather than marching up in a neat line.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\">Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', op. cit.</ref>\n\nFighting with gaps is thus feasible as writers like Polybius assert. According to those who support the ''quincunx'' formation view, what made the Roman approach stand out is that their intervals were generally larger and more systematically organized than those of other ancient armies. Each gap was covered by maniples or cohorts from lines farther back. Penetration of any significance could not just slip in unmolested. It would not only be mauled as it fought past the gauntlet of the first line but would also clash with aggressive units moving up to plug the space.<ref>Goldsworthy, 1996, pp. 138-40</ref> From a larger standpoint, as the battle waxed and waned, fresh units might be deployed through the intervals to relieve the men of the first line, allowing continual pressure to be brought forward.\n\n====Mixing of a continuous front with interval fighting====\nOne scenario for not using gaps is deployment in a limited space, such as the top of a hill or ravine, where extensive spreading out would not be feasible. Another is a particular attack formation, such as the wedge discussed above, or an encirclement as at the [[battle of Ilipa]]. Yet another is a closing phase manoeuvre when a solid line is constructed to make a last, final push as in the [[battle of Zama]]. During the maelstrom of battle, it is also possible that as the units merged into line, the general checkerboard spacing became more compressed or even disappeared, and the fighting would see a more or less solid line engaged with the enemy. Thus gaps at the beginning of the struggle might tend to vanish in the closing phases.<ref>Lt. Col. S.G. Brady, ''The Military Affairs of Ancient Rome and Roman Art of War in Caesar's Time'', The Military Service Publishing Company: 1947- url: http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/romanarmy/</ref>\n\nSome historians view the intervals as primarily useful in maneuver. Before the legionaries closed with the enemy each echelon would form a solid line to engage. If things went badly for the first line, it would retreat through the gaps and the second echelon moved up- again forming a continuous front. Should they be discomfited, there still remained the veterans of the ''triarii'' who let the survivors retreat through the preset gaps. The veterans then formed a continuous front to engage the enemy or provided cover for the retreat of the army as a whole. The same procedure was followed when the ''triarii'' was phased out - intervals for manoeuvre, reforming and recovery- solid line to engage.<ref>Nardo, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 23\u201329</ref> Some writers maintain that in [[Julius Caesar|Caesar's]] armies the use of the ''quincunx'' and its gaps seems to have declined, and his legions generally deployed in three unbroken lines as shown above, with four cohorts in front, and three apiece in the echeloned order. The relief was provided by the second and third lines 'filtering' forward to relieve their comrades in small groups, while the exhausted and wounded eased back from the front.<ref>Brady, op. cit, See also Warry, pg 169-170</ref> The Romans still remained flexible however, using gaps and deploying four or sometimes two lines based on the tactical situation.<ref>John Warry, ''Warfare in the Ancient World'', p. 169-170</ref>\n\n====Line spacing and combat stamina====\nAnother unique feature of the Roman infantry was the depth of its spacing. Most ancient armies deployed in shallower formations, particularly [[phalanx formation|phalanx]]-type forces. Phalanxes might deepen their ranks heavily to add both stamina and shock power, but their general approach still favoured one massive line, as opposed to the deep three-layer Roman arrangement. The advantage of the Roman system is that it allowed the continual funnelling or metering of combat power forward over a longer period&mdash;massive, steadily renewed pressure to the front&mdash;until the enemy broke. Deployment of the second and third lines required careful consideration by the Roman commander. Deployed too early, and they might get entangled in the frontal fighting and become exhausted. Deployed too late, and they might be swept away in a rout if the first line began to break. Tight control had to be maintained, hence the 3rd line ''triarii'' were sometimes made to [[Squatting position|squat]] or [[kneel]], effectively discouraging premature movement to the front. The Roman commander was thus generally mobile, constantly moving from spot to spot, and often riding back in person to fetch reserves if there was no time for standard messenger service. A large number of officers in the typical Roman army, and the flexible breakdown into sub-units like cohorts or maniples greatly aided coordination of such moves.<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', pp.53\u201362</ref>\n\nWhatever the actual formation took however, the ominous funnelling or surge of combat power up to the front remained constant:\n:''\"When the first line as a whole had done its best and become weakened and exhausted by losses, it gave way to the relief of freshmen from the second line who, passing through it gradually, pressed forward one by one, or in single file, and worked their way into the fight in the same way. Meanwhile the tired men of the original first line, when sufficiently rested, reformed and re-entered the fight. This continued until all men of the first and second lines had been engaged. This does not presuppose an actual withdrawal of the first line, but rather a merging, a blending or a coalescing of both lines. Thus the enemy was given no rest and was continually opposed by fresh troops until, exhausted and demoralized, he yielded to repeated attacks.\"''<ref>Lt. Col. S.G. Brady, ''The Military Affairs of Ancient Rome and Roman Art of War in Caesar's Time'', The Military Service Publishing Company: 1947&ndash; url: http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/romanarmy/</ref>\n\n===Post-deployment commands===\n[[Image:Reenact testudo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Roman re-enactors demonstrate a variant of the Roman [[testudo formation]]]]\n\nWhatever the deployment, the Roman army was marked both by flexibility and strong discipline and cohesion. Different formations were assumed according to different tactical situations.\n* ''Repellere equites'' (\"repel horsemen/knights\") was the formation used to resist cavalry. The legionaries would assume a [[Infantry square|square]] formation, holding their pila as spears in the space between their shields and strung together shoulder to shoulder.\n* At the command ''iacite pila'', the legionaries hurled their pila at the enemy.\n* At the command ''cuneum formate'', the infantry formed a [[Flying wedge|wedge]] to charge and break enemy lines. This formation was used as a [[Shock troops|shock]] tactic.\n* At the command ''contendite vestra sponte'', the legionaries assumed an aggressive stance and attacked every opponent they faced.\n* At the command ''orbem formate'', the legionaries assumed a circle-like formation with the archers placed in the midst of and behind the legionaries providing missile fire support. This tactic was used mainly when a small number of legionaries had to hold a position and were surrounded by enemies.\n* At the command ''ciringite frontem'', the legionaries held their position.\n* At the command ''frontem allargate'', a scattered formation was adopted.\n* At the command ''testudinem formate'', the legionaries assumed the [[Testudo formation|''testudo'' (tortoise) formation]]. This was slow-moving but almost impenetrable to enemy fire, and thus very effective during sieges and/or when facing off against enemy archers. However, the testudo formation didn't allow for effective close combat and therefore it was used when the enemy were far enough away so as the legionaries could get into another formation before being attacked.\n*At the command ''tecombre'', the legionaries would break the Testudo formation and revert to their previous formation.\n* At the command ''Agmen formate'', the legionaries assumed a [[Infantry square|square formation]], which was also the typical shape of a century in battle.\n\n==Siegecraft and fortifications==\n===Besieging cities===\n''Oppidum expugnare'' was the Roman term for besieging cities. It was divided into three phases:\n[[Image:Balliste.jpg|thumb|Modern reconstruction of a ''Scorpio''.]]\n# In the first phase, engineers (the ''cohors fabrorum'') built a fortified camp near the city with walls of [[circumvallation]] and at the command 'turres extruere' built watch towers to prevent the enemy from bringing in reinforcements. Siege towers were built, trenches were dug and traps set all around the city. Also second, exterior line of walls (''[[contravallation]]'')  was built around the city facing the enemy, as Caesar did at the [[Battle of Alesia]]. Sometimes the Romans would [[Mining (military)|mine]] the enemy's walls.\n# The second phase began with [[Onager (siege weapon)|onager]] and [[ballista]] fire to cover the approach of the siege towers, which were full of legionaries ready to assault the wall's defenders. Meanwhile, other cohorts approached the city's wall in [[testudo formation]], bringing up battering rams and ladders to breach the gates and scale the walls.\n# The third phase included the opening of the city's main gate by the cohorts which had managed to break through or scale the walls, provided the rams had not knocked the gate open. Once the main gate was opened or the walls breached, the cavalry and other cohorts entered the city to finish off the remaining defenders.\n\n===Field fortifications===\nWhile strong cities/forts and elaborate sieges to capture them were common throughout the ancient world, the Romans were unique among ancient armies in their extensive use of field fortifications. In campaign after campaign, enormous effort was expended to dig\u2014a job done by the ordinary legionary. His field pack included a shovel, a ''[[dolabra]]'' or pickaxe, and a wicker basket for hauling dirt. Some soldiers also carried a type of turf cutter. With these, they dug trenches, built walls and palisades and constructed assault roads. The operations of [[Julius Caesar]] at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] are well known. The Gallic city was surrounded by massive double walls penning in defenders, and keeping out relieving attackers. A network of camps and forts were included in these works. The inner trench alone was {{convert|20|ft|m}} deep, and Caesar diverted a river to fill it with water. The ground was also sown with caltrops of iron barbs at various places to discourage assault. Surprisingly for such an infantry centred battle, Caesar relied heavily on [[cavalry]] forces to counter Gallic sorties. Ironically, many of these were from Germanic tribes who had come to terms earlier.<ref name=\"Warry, pp. 159-172\">Warry, pp. 159\u2013172</ref>\n\nThe power of Roman field camps has been noted earlier, but in other actions, the Romans sometimes used trenches to secure their flanks against envelopment when they were outnumbered, as Caesar did during operations in Belgaic [[Gaul]]. In the [[Brittany]] region of France, [[Mole (architecture)|moles]] and breakwaters were constructed at enormous effort to assault the estuarine strongholds of the Gauls. Internal Roman fighting between Caesar and Pompey also saw the frequent employment of trenches, counter-trenches, dug-in strong points, and other works as the contenders manoeuvred against each other in field combat.<ref name=\"Warry, pp. 159-172\"/> In the latter stages of the empire, the extensive use of such field fortifications declined as the heavy infantry itself was phased down. Nevertheless, they were an integral part of the relentless Roman rise to dominance over large parts of the ancient world.<ref>Warry, pp. 115\u2013169</ref>\n\n==Infantry effectiveness==\n\n===Roman infantry versus the Macedonian phalanx===\n'''Strengths of the Macedonian [[phalanx formation|phalanx]].''' Prior to the rise of Rome, the Macedonian phalanx was the premiere infantry force in the Western World. It had proven itself on the battlefields of Mediterranean Europe, from [[Sparta]] to [[Macedon]]ia, and had met and overcome several strong non-European armies from Persia to Pakistan/Northwest India. Packed into a dense armoured mass, and equipped with massive pikes 12 to {{convert|21|ft|m}} in length, the phalanx was a formidable force. While defensive configurations were sometimes used, the phalanx was most effective when it was moving forward in attack, either in a frontal charge or in \"oblique\" or echeloned order against an opposing flank, as the victories of [[Alexander the Great]] and Theban innovator [[Epaminondas]] attest. When working with other formations\u2014light infantry and cavalry\u2014it was, at its height under Alexander, without peer.<ref name=\"Polybius, Histories pp. 511-12\">Polybius, ''Histories'' pp. 511-12</ref>\n\n'''Weaknesses of the Macedonian phalanx.''' Nevertheless, the Macedonian phalanx had key weaknesses. It had some manoeuvrability, but once a clash was joined this decreased, particularly on rough ground. Its \"dense pack\" approach also made it rigid. Compressed in the heat of battle, its troops could only primarily fight facing forward. The diversity of troops gave the phalanx great flexibility, but this diversity was a double-edged sword, relying on a mix of units that was complicated to control and position. These included not only the usual heavy infantrymen, cavalry and light infantry but also various elite units, medium armed groups, foreign contingents with their own styles and shock units of [[war-elephant]]s.<ref>John Warry, Warfare in the Ancient World, (St. Martin's, 1980), pp. 70-86</ref> Such \"mixed\" forces presented additional command and control problems. If properly organized and fighting together a long time under capable leaders, they could be very proficient. The campaigns of Alexander and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] (a Hellenic-style formation of mixed contingents) show this. Without such long-term cohesion and leadership, however, their performance was uneven. By the time the Romans were engaging against Hellenistic armies, the Greeks had ceased to use strong flank guards and cavalry contingents, and their system had degenerated into a mere clash of phalanxes. This was the formation overcome by the Romans at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]].\n\n'''Advantages of Roman infantry.''' The Romans themselves had retained some aspects of the classical phalanx (not to be confused with the Macedonian phalanx) in their early legions, most notably the final line of fighters in the classic \"triple line\", the spearmen of the ''triarii''. The long pikes of the ''triarii'' were to eventually disappear, and all hands were uniformly equipped with short sword, shield and pilum, and deployed in the distinctive Roman tactical system, which provided more standardization and cohesion in the long run over the Hellenic type formations.\n\nPhalanxes facing the legion were vulnerable to the more flexible Roman \"checkerboard\" deployment, which provided each fighting man a good chunk of personal space to engage in close order fighting. The manipular system also allowed entire Roman sub-units to manoeuvre more widely, freed from the need to always remain tightly packed in rigid formation. The deep three-line deployment of the Romans allowed combat pressure to be steadily applied forward. Most phalanxes favoured one huge line several ranks deep. This might do well in the initial stages, but as the battle entangled more and more men, the stacked Roman formation allowed fresh pressure to be imposed over a more extended time. As combat lengthened and the battlefield compressed, the phalanx might thus become exhausted or rendered immobile, while the Romans still had enough left to not only manoeuvre but to make the final surges forward.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_a\" /> Hannibal's deployment at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] appears to recognize this\u2014hence the Carthaginian also used a deep three-layer approach, sacrificing his first two lower quality lines and holding back his combat-hardened veterans of Italy for the final encounter. Hannibal's arrangement had much to recommend it given his weakness in cavalry and infantry, but he made no provision for one line relieving the other as the Romans did. Each line fought its own lonely battle and the last ultimately perished when the Romans reorganized for a final surge.\n\nThe legions also drilled and trained together over a more extended time, and were more uniform and streamlined, (unlike Hannibal's final force and others) enabling even less than brilliant army commanders to manoeuvre and position their forces proficiently. These qualities, among others, made them more than a match for the phalanx, when they met in combat.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\" />\n\nAccording to Polybius, in his comparison of the phalanx versus the Roman system:\n:''\".. Whereas the phalanx requires one time and one type of ground. Its use requires flat and level ground which is unencumbered by any obstacles.. If the enemy refuses to come down to [meet it on the level ground].. what purpose can the phalanx serve?.. [Also] the phalanx soldier cannot operate in either smaller units or singly, whereas the Roman formation is highly flexible. Every Roman soldier.. can adapt himself equally well to any place of time and meet an attack from any quarter.. Accordingly, since the effective use of parts of the Roman army is so much superior, their plans are much more likely to achieve success.\"''<ref name=\"Polybius, Histories pp. 511-12\"/>\n\n====Versus Pyrrhus====\n{{See also|Pyrrhus of Epirus}}\n\nThe Greek king Pyrrhus' phalangical system was to prove a tough trial for the Romans. Despite several defeats, the Romans inflicted such losses on the [[Epirote]] army that the phrase \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" has become a byword for a victory won at a terrible cost. A skilful and experienced commander, Pyrrhus deployed a typically mixed phalanx system, including shock units of war-elephants, and formations of light infantry ([[peltasts]]), elite units, and cavalry to support his infantry. Using these he was able to defeat the Romans twice, with a third battle deemed inconclusive or a limited Roman tactical success by many scholars. The battles below (see individual articles for detailed accounts) illustrate the difficulties of fighting against phalanx forces. If well-led and deployed (compare Pyrrhus to the fleeing [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] at Pydna below), they presented a credible infantry alternative to the heavy legion. The Romans, however, were to learn from their mistakes. In subsequent battles after the Pyrrhic wars, they showed themselves masters of the Hellenic phalanx.\n\n* [[Battle of Heraclea]]\n* [[Battle of Asculum]]\n* [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]\n\n====Notable triumphs====\n\n=====Battle of Cynoscephalae=====\n{{main|Battle of Cynoscephalae}}\n\nIn this battle the Macedonian phalanx originally held the high ground but all of its units had not been properly positioned due to earlier skirmishing. Nevertheless, an advance by its left-wing drove back the Romans, who counterattacked on the right flank and made some progress against a somewhat disorganized Macedonian left. However, the issue was still in doubt until an unknown tribune (officer) detached 20 maniples from the Roman line and made an encircling attack against the Macedonian rear. This caused the enemy phalanx to collapse, securing a route for the Romans. The more flexible, streamlined legionary organization had exploited the weaknesses of the densely packed phalanx. Such triumphs secured Roman hegemony in Greece and adjoining lands.\n\n=====Battle of Pydna=====\n{{main|Battle of Pydna}}\n\nAt Pydna the contenders deployed on a relatively flat plain, and the Macedonians had augmented the infantry with a sizeable cavalry contingent. At the hour of decision, the enemy phalanx advanced in formidable array against the Roman line and made some initial progress. However, the ground it had to advance over was rough, and the powerful phalangial formation lost its tight cohesion. The Romans absorbed the initial shock and came on into the fray, where their more spacious formation and continuously applied pressure proved decisive in hand-to-hand combat on the rough ground. Shield and sword at close quarters on such terrain neutralized the long [[pike (weapon)|pike]], and supplementary Macedonian weapons (lighter armour and a dagger-like short sword) made an indifferent showing against the skilful and aggressive assault of the heavy Roman infantrymen. The opposition also failed to deploy supporting forces effectively to help the phalanx at its time of dire need. Indeed, the Macedonian commander, Perseus, seeing the situation deteriorating, seems to have fled without even bringing his cavalry into the engagement. The affair was decided in less than two hours, with a comprehensive defeat for the Macedonians.\n\n====Other anti-phalanx tactics====\n\"Breaking [[phalanx formation|phalanxes]]\" illustrates more of the Roman army's flexibility. When the Romans faced [[phalangite]] armies, the legions often deployed the [[velites]] in front of the enemy with the command to ''contendite vestra sponte'' (attack), presumably with their javelins, to cause confusion and panic in the solid blocks of phalanxes. Meanwhile, [[Archery|auxilia archers]] were deployed on the wings of the legion in front of the [[cavalry]], in order to defend their withdrawal. These archers were ordered to ''eiaculare flammas'', fire incendiary [[arrow]]s into the enemy. The cohorts then advanced in a [[Formation (military)|wedge formation]], supported by the velites' and auxiliaries' fire, and charged into the phalanx at a single point, breaking it, then flanking it with the cavalry to seal the victory. See the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] for evidence of fire-arrows being used.\n\n====Versus Hannibal's Carthage====\n'''Tactical superiority of Hannibal's forces'''. While not a classic phalanx force, Hannibal's army was composed of \"mixed\" contingents and elements common to Hellenic formations, and it is told that towards the end of his life, Hannibal reportedly named Pyrrhus as the commander of the past that he most admired<ref>Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars''</ref> Rome however had blunted Pyrrhus' hosts prior to the rise of Hannibal, and given their advantages in organization, discipline, and resource mobilization, why did they not make a better showing in the field against the Carthaginian, who throughout most of his campaign in Italy suffered from numerical inferiority and lack of support from his homeland?\n\nHannibal's individual genius, the steadiness of his core troops (forged over several years of fighting together in Spain, and later in Italy) and his cavalry arm seem to be the decisive factors. Time after time Hannibal exploited the tendencies of the Romans, particularly their eagerness to close and achieve a decisive victory. The cold, tired, wet legionnaires that slogged out of the Trebia River to form up on the river bank are but one example of how Hannibal forced or manipulated the Romans into fighting on his terms, and on the ground of his own choosing. The later debacles at [[Battle of Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], forced the proud Romans to avoid battle, shadowing the Carthaginians from the high ground of the Apennines, unwilling to risk a significant engagement on the plains where the enemy cavalry held sway.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\" />\n\n'''Growing Roman tactical sophistication and ability to adapt overcome earlier disasters.''' But while the case of Hannibal underscored that the Romans were far from invincible, it also demonstrated their long-term strengths. Rome had a vast manpower surplus far outnumbering Hannibal that gave them more options and flexibility. They isolated and eventually bottled up the Carthaginians and hastened their withdrawal from Italy with the constant manoeuvre. More importantly, they used their manpower resources to launch an offensive into Spain and Africa. They were willing to absorb the humiliation in Italy and remain on the strategic defensive, but with typical relentless persistence they struck elsewhere, to finally crush their foes.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe_b\" />\n\nThey also learned from those enemies. The operations of [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] were an improvement on some of those who had previously faced Hannibal, showing a higher level of advance thinking, preparation and organization. (Compare with Sempronius at the [[Battle of the Trebia|Battle of the Trebia River]] for example). Scipio's contribution was in part to implement more flexible manoeuvre of tactical units, instead of the straight-ahead, three-line grind favoured by some contemporaries. He also made better use of cavalry, traditionally an arm in which the Romans were lacking. His operations also included pincer movements, a consolidated battle line, and \"reverse Cannae\" formations and cavalry movements. His victories in Spain and the African campaign demonstrated a new sophistication in Roman warfare and reaffirmed the Roman capacity to adapt, persist and overcome.<ref name=\"GoldsworthyThe\"/> See detailed battles:\n\n* [[Battle of Baecula]]\n* [[Battle of Ilipa]]\n* [[Battle of Zama]]\n\n===Roman infantry versus Gallic and the Germanic tribes===\n\n====Barbarian armies====\nViews of the Gallic enemies of Rome have varied widely. Some older histories consider them to be backward savages, ruthlessly destroying the civilization and \"grandeur that was Rome.\" Some modernist views see them in a proto-nationalist light, ancient freedom fighters resisting the iron boot of empire. Often their bravery is celebrated as worthy adversaries of Rome. See the [[Dying Gaul]] for an example. The Gallic opposition was also composed of a large number of different peoples and tribes, geographically ranging from the mountains of Switzerland to the lowlands of France and thus are not easy to categorize. The term \"Gaul\" has also been used interchangeably to describe [[Celt]]ic peoples farther afield in [[Brittannia|Britain]] adding even more to the diversity of peoples lumped together under this name. From a military standpoint, however, they seem to have shared certain general characteristics: tribal polities with a relatively small and lesser elaborated state structure, light weaponry, fairly unsophisticated tactics and organization<!--professional soldiers gathering around a chief-->, a high degree of mobility<!--some sources on the percentage of cavalry/chariots-->, and inability to sustain combat power in their field forces over a lengthy period.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck, Warfare in Antiquity\">Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''Warfare in Antiquity''</ref> Roman sources reflect on the prejudices of their times, but nevertheless testify to the Gauls' fierceness and bravery.\n:''\"Their chief weapons were long, two-edged swords of soft iron. For defence, they carried small wicker shields. Their armies were undisciplined mobs, greedy for plunder.. Brave to the point of recklessness, they were formidable warriors, and the ferocity of their first assault inspired terror even in the ranks of veteran armies.\"''<ref>Don Nardo, ''The Roman Army: Instrument of Power'', Lucent Books: 2004, 22-23</ref>\n\n====Early Gallic victories====\nThough popular accounts celebrate the legions and an assortment of charismatic commanders quickly vanquishing massive hosts of \"wild barbarians\",<ref>The opening scene of the 2000 US movie ''Gladiator'', showing Germanic [[barbarians]] being vanquished, was shown to senior American officers before the 2003 US attack on Iraq as a motivational tool- reported in Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor, ''Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq'', (Pantheon Books, 2006) p. 164</ref> Rome suffered a number of early defeats against such tribal armies. As early as the Republican period (circa 390\u2013387 BC), they had [[Battle of the Allia|sacked Rome]] under [[Brennus]], and had won several other victories such as the [[Battle of Noreia]] and the [[Battle of Arausio]]. The foremost Gallic triumph in this early period was ''\"The Day of Allia\"''- July 18- when Roman troops were routed and driven into the Allia River. Henceforth, July 18 was considered an unlucky date on the Roman Calendar.<ref>Don Nardo, ''The Roman Army'': pp. 22-23</ref>\n\nSome writers suggest that as a result of such debacles, the expanding Roman power began to adjust to this vigorous, fast-moving new enemy.<ref>Nardo, op. cit</ref> The Romans began to phase out the monolithic phalanx they formerly fought in and adopted the more flexible manipular formation. The circular hoplite shield was also enlarged and eventually replaced with the rectangular ''scutum'' for better protection. The heavy phalanx spear was replaced by the pila, suitable for throwing. Only the veterans of the ''triarii'' retained the long spear- vestige of the former phalanx. Such early reforms also aided the Romans in their conquest of the rest of Italy over such foes as the Samnites, Latins and Greeks.<ref>Nardo, ''The Roman Army'', pp. 23-30</ref> As time went on Roman arms saw increasing triumph over the Gallics, particularly in the campaigns of Caesar. In the early imperial period, however, Germanic warbands inflicted one of Rome's greatest military defeats, (the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]) which saw the destruction of three imperial legions and was to place a limit on Roman expansion in the West. And it was these Germanic tribes in part (most having some familiarity with Rome and its culture, and becoming more Romanized themselves) that were to eventually bring about the Roman military's final demise in the West. Ironically, in the final days, the bulk of the fighting was between forces composed mostly of barbarians on either side.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation''</ref>\n\n====Tactical performance versus Gallic and Germanic opponents====\n\n=====Gallic and Germanic strengths=====\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SambreBattleV1.0.gif|thumb|right|Tactical map of near victory by the Gauls at the Sambre River. Note covering forests where the Germanic warriors massed in secret for the assault. Quick charges almost liquidated the Roman position.]] -->\n\nWhatever their particular culture, the Gallic and Germanic tribes generally proved themselves to be tough opponents, racking up several victories over their enemies. Some historians show that they sometimes used massed fighting in tightly packed phalanx-type formations with overlapping shields, and employed shield coverage during sieges. In open battle, they sometimes used a triangular \"wedge\" style formation in attack. Their greatest hope of success lay in 4 factors: (a) numerical superiority, (b) surprising the Romans (via an ambush for example) or in (c) advancing quickly to the fight, or (d) engaging the Romans over heavily covered or difficult terrain where units of the fighting horde could shelter within striking distance until the hour of decision, or if possible, withdraw and regroup between successive charges.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck 1990\">Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''History of the Art of War'', Vols. I & II. University of Nebraska Press (1990) [1920-21].</ref>\n\nMost significant Gallic and Germanic victories show two or more of these characteristics. The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] contains all four: numerical superiority, surprise,  quick charges to close rapidly, and favorable terrain and environmental conditions (thick forest and pounding rainstorms) that hindered Roman movement and gave the warriors enough cover to conceal their movements and mount successive attacks against the Roman line. Another factor in the Romans' defeat was a treacherous defection by [[Arminius]] and his contingent.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Macropedia, 1974 ed, \"Germans, Ancient\"</ref>\n\n=====Gallic and Germanic weaknesses=====\n\n'''Weaknesses in organization and equipment.''' Against the fighting men from the legion however, the Gauls, Iberians and Germanic forces faced a daunting task. The barbarians' rudimentary organization and tactics fared poorly against the well-oiled machinery that was the Legion. The fierceness of the Gallic and Germanic charges is often commented upon by some writers, and in certain circumstances, they could overwhelm Roman lines. Nevertheless, the in-depth Roman formation allowed adjustments to be made, and the continual application of forwarding pressure made long-term combat a hazardous proposition for the Gauls.\n\nFlank attacks were always possible, but the legion was flexible enough to pivot to meet this, either through sub-unit manoeuvre or through the deployment of lines farther back. The cavalry screen on the flanks also added another layer of security, as did nightly regrouping in fortified camps. The Gauls and Germans also fought with little or no [[armour]] and with weaker shields, putting them at a disadvantage against the legion. Other items of Roman equipment from studded sandals, to body armour, to metal helmets added to Roman advantages. Generally speaking, the Gauls and Germans needed to get into good initial position against the Romans and to overwhelm them in the early phases of the battle. An extended set-piece slogging match between the lightly armed tribesmen and the well-organized heavy legionaries usually spelt doom for the tribal fighters.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck 1990\"/> Caesar's slaughter of the Helvetii near the Sa\u00f4ne River is just one example of tribal disadvantage against the well-organized Romans,<ref>Nardo, pg 74</ref> as is the victory of Germanicus at the Weser River and Agricola against the Celtic tribesmen of Caledonia (Scotland) circa 84 A.D.<ref name=\"Nardo, pg. 90\">Nardo, pg. 90</ref>\n\n'''Weaknesses in logistics.''' Roman logistics also provided a trump card against Germanic foes as it had against so many previous foes. Tacitus in his ''Annals'' reports that the Roman commander Germanicus recognized that continued operations in Gaul would require long trains of men and material to come overland, where they would be subject to attack as they traversed the forests and swamps. He, therefore, opened sea and river routes, moving large quantities of supplies and reinforcements relatively close to the zone of battle, bypassing the dangerous land routes. In addition, the Roman fortified camps provided secure staging areas for offensive, defensive and logistical operations, once their troops were deployed. Assault roads and causeways were constructed on the marshy ground to facilitate manoeuvre, sometimes under direct Gallic attack. These Roman techniques repeatedly defeated their Germanic adversaries.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' - Book II - \"War with the Germans\", THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS, OUT OF THE FIRST SIX ANNALS OF TACITUS; WITH HIS ACCOUNT OF GERMANY, AND LIFE OF AGRICOLA, TRANSLATED BY THOMAS GORDON, 1917. url: https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7rtib10.txt</ref> While Germanic leaders and fighters influenced by Roman methods sometimes adapted them, most tribes did not have the strong organization of the Romans. As German scholar Hans Delbruck notes in his \"History of the Art of War\":\n:''\".. the superiority of the Roman art of warfare was based on the army organization.. a system that permitted very large masses of men to be concentrated at a given point, to move in an orderly fashion, to be fed, to be kept together. The Gauls could do none of these things.\"''<ref>Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''History of the Art of War'', (Vol. I, p. 510), University of Nebraska Press (1990) [1920-21].</ref>\n\n=====Gallic and Germanic chariots=====\nThe Gallic also demonstrated a high level of tactical prowess in some areas. Gallic [[chariot]] warfare, for example, showed a high degree of integration and coordination with infantry, and Gallic horse and chariot assaults sometimes threatened Roman forces in the field with annihilation. At the [[Battle of Sentinum]] for example, c. 295 BC, the Roman and Campanian cavalry encountered Gallic war-chariots and were routed in confusion\u2014driven back from the Roman infantry by the unexpected appearance of the fast-moving Gallic assault. The discipline of the Roman infantry restored the line, however, and a counterattack eventually defeated the Gallic forces and their allies.<ref>DENISON, GEORGE T. ''A History of Cavalry. From the earliest times, with Lessons for the Future''. London Macmillan and Co. 1877, 1913, pp 62-89 (In public domain- see Google Books</ref>\n\nThe accounts of [[Polybius]] leading up to the [[Battle of Telamon]], c. 225 BC mention chariot warfare, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The Gauls met comprehensive defeat by the Roman legions under [[Papus]] and [[Regulus]]. Chariot forces also attacked the legions as they were disembarking from ships during Caesar's invasion of Britain, but the Roman commander drove off the fast-moving assailants using covering fire (slings, arrows and engines of war) from his ships and reinforcing his shore party of infantry to charge and drive off the attack. In the open field against Caesar, the Gallic/Celtics apparently deployed chariots with a driver and an infantry fighter armed with javelins. During the clash, the chariots would drop off their warriors to attack the enemy and retire a short distance away, massed in reserve. From this position, they could retrieve the assault troops if the engagement was going badly, or apparently, pick them up and deploy elsewhere. Caesar's troops were discomfited by one such attack, and he met it by withdrawing into his fortified redoubt. A later Gallic attack against the Roman camp was routed.<ref>Gaius Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'', translated by W.A. McDevitte and W.S. Bohn. New York: Harper & Brothers, 1869. url: http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/caesar/gallic_e4.html#32</ref>\n\nSuperb as the Gallic fighters were, chariots were already declining as an effective weapon of war in the ancient world with the rise of mounted cavalry.<ref>[http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/chariot.htm Chariots: Warfare with Attitude]</ref> At the battle of Mons Grapius in Caledonia (circa 84AD), Celtic chariots made an appearance. However, they were no longer used in an offensive role but primarily for the pre-battle show - riding back and forth and hurling insults. The main encounter was decided by infantry and mounted cavalry.<ref name=\"Nardo, pg. 90\"/>\n\n=====Superior tactical organization: victory of Caesar at the Sambre River=====\nSuperior Gallic mobility and numbers often troubled Roman arms, whether deployed in decades-long mobile or guerrilla warfare or in decisive field engagement. The near-defeat of Caesar in his Gallic campaign confirms this latter pattern but also shows the strengths of Roman tactical organization and discipline. At the [[Battle of the Sabis]] river, (''see more detailed article'') contingents of the [[Nervii]], Atrebates, Veromandui and Aduatuci tribes massed secretly in the surrounding forests as the main Roman force was busy making camp on the opposite side of the river. Some distance away behind them slogged two slow-moving legions with the baggage train. Engaged in foraging and camp construction the Roman forces were somewhat scattered. As camp building commenced, the barbarian forces launched a ferocious attack, streaming across the shallow water and quickly assaulting the distracted Romans. This incident is discussed in Caesar's ''Gallic War Commentaries.''<ref>\n''[https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10657 Caesar's Commentaries (THE WAR IN GAUL - THE CIVIL WAR)]'' English translation by W. A. MACDEVITT, introduction by THOMAS DE QUINCEY (1915) -- At [[Gutenberg Project]]</ref>\n\nSo far the situation looked promising for the warrior host.<ref name=\"Hans Delbr\u00fcck, Warfare in Antiquity\"/> The 4 conditions above were in their favour: (a) numerical superiority, (b) the element of surprise, (c) a quick advance/assault, and (d) favourable terrain that masked their movements until the last minute. Early progress was spectacular as the initial Roman dispositions were driven back. A rout looked possible. Caesar himself rallied sections of his endangered army, impressing resolve upon the troops. With their customary discipline and cohesion, the Romans then began to drive back the [[barbarian]] assault. A charge by the Nervi tribe through a gap between the legions however almost turned the tide again, as the onrushing warriors seized the Roman camp and tried to outflank the other army units engaged with the rest of the tribal host. The initial phase of the clash had passed however and a slogging match ensued. The arrival of the two rear legions that had been guarding the baggage reinforced the Roman lines. Led by the 10th Legion, a counterattack was mounted with these reinforcements that broke the back of the barbarian effort and sent the tribesmen reeling in retreat. It was a close-run thing, illustrating both the fighting prowess of the tribal forces and the steady, disciplined cohesion of the Romans. Ultimately, the latter was to prove decisive in Rome's long fought conquest of Gaul.\n\n=====Persisting logistics strategy: Gallic victory at Gergovia=====\nAs noted above, the fierce charge of the Gauls and their individual prowess is frequently acknowledged by several ancient Roman writers.<ref>Theodore Dodge. 1892. C\u00e6sar: a history of the art of war among the Romans Down to the End of the Roman Empire. 2 vol. Houghton-Mifflin</ref> The [[Battle of Gergovia]] however demonstrates that the Gallic were capable of a level of strategic insight and operation beyond merely mustering warriors for an open field clash. Under their war leader [[Vercingetorix]], the Gallic pursued what some modern historians have termed a \"persisting\" or \"logistics strategy\" - a mobile approach relying not on direct open field clashes, but avoidance of major battle, \"scorched earth\" denial of resources, and the isolation and piecemeal destruction of Roman detachments and smaller unit groupings.<ref>Archer Jones. 2001. The art of war in the Western world. University of Illinois Press. pp. 68-89</ref> When implemented consistently, this strategy saw some success against Roman operations. According to Caesar himself, during the siege of the town of Bourges, the lurking warbands of Gauls were:\n\n:\"on the watch for our foraging and grain-gatherer parties, when necessarily scattered far afield he attacked them and inflicted serious losses... This imposed such scarcity upon the army that for several days they were without grain and staved off starvation only by driving cattle from remote villages.\"<ref>Jones, art of war..68-89</ref>\nCaesar countered with a strategy of enticing the Gallic forces out into open battle, or of blockading them into submission.\n\nAt the town of Gergovia, resource denial was combined with a concentration of superior force and multiple threats from more than one direction. This caused the opposing Roman forces to divide and ultimately fail. Gergovia was situated on the high ground of a tall hill, and Vercingetorix carefully drew up the bulk of his force on the slope, positioning allied tribes in designated places. He drilled his men and skirmished daily with the Romans, who had overrun a hilltop position and had created a small camp some distance from Caesar's larger main camp. A rallying of about 10,000 disenchanted Aeudan tribesmen (engineered by Vercingetorix's agents) created a threat in Caesar's rear, including a threat to a supply convoy promised by the allied Aeudans, and he diverted four legions to meet this danger.<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins (2002). Caesar's legion: the epic saga of Julius Caesar's elite tenth legion. Wiley. pp. 50\u201369</ref> This, however, gave Vercingetorix's forces the chance to concentrate in superior strength against the smaller two-legion force left behind at Gergovia, and desperate fighting ensued. Caesar dealt with the real threat, turned around and by ruthlessly forced marching once again consolidated his forces at the town. A feint using bogus cavalry by the Romans drew off part of the Gallic assault, and the Romans advanced to capture three more enemy outposts on the slope, and proceeded towards the walls of the stronghold. The diverted Gallic forces returned however and in frantic fighting outside the town walls, the Romans lost 700 men, including 46 centurions.\n\nCaesar commenced a retreat from the town with the victorious Gallic warriors in pursuit. The Roman commander, however, mobilized his 10th Legion as a blocking force to cover his withdrawal and after some fighting, the tribesmen themselves withdrew back to Gergovia, taking several captured legion standards. The vicious fighting around Gergovia was the first time Caesar had suffered a military reverse, demonstrating the Gallic martial valor noted by the ancient chroniclers. The hard battle is referenced by the Roman historian Plutarch, who writes of the Averni people showing visitors a sword in one of their temples, a weapon that reputedly belonged to Caesar himself. According to Plutarch, the Roman general was shown the sword in the temple at Gergovia some years after the battle, but he refused to reclaim it, saying that it was consecrated, and to leave it where it was.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dando-Collins. Caesar's legions. 52-68</ref>\n\nThe Gallic were unable to sustain their strategy, however, and Vercingetorix was to become trapped in Alesia, facing not divided sections or detachments of the Roman Army but Caesar's full force of approximately 70,000 men (50,000 legionnaires plus numerous additional auxiliary cavalry and infantry). This massive concentration of Romans was able to besiege the fortress in detail and repulse Gallic relief forces, and it fell in little more than a month.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Vercingetorix overall persisting logistics policy, however, demonstrates a significant level of strategic thinking. As historian A. Goldsworthy (2006) notes: \"His [Vercingetorix's] strategy was considerably more sophisticated than that employed by Caesar's earlier opponents..\"<ref>Adrian Goldsworthy. ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus''. Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 3291-359</ref> At Alesia this mobile approach became overly static. The Gauls gave battle at a place where they were inadequately provisioned for an extended siege, and where Caesar could bring his ''entire'' field force to bear on a single point without them being dissipated, and where his lines of supply were not effectively interdicted.<ref>Stephen Dando-Collins (2002). Caesar's legion: the epic saga of Julius Caesar's elite tenth legion. Wiley. pp. 50-69</ref> At Gergovia by contrast, Caesar's strength was divided by the appearance of another Gallic force in his rear (the Aeudans)- threatening his sources and lines of supply. Together with a strong defensive anvil, (the town) supported by an offensive hammer (the open field forces), and coupled with previous resource denial pressure over time, the Romans were forced to retreat, and the Gallic secured a victory. As one historian notes about the persisting strategy:\n\n:\"But before the defeat at Alesia, Vercingetorix's strategy had driven Cesar from central Gaul.. In finding and overwhelming Roman foragers as Fabius had done to Hannibal's men, the Gauls concentrated against weakness to win many small victories. Their strength in cavalry helped them concentrate rapidly, facilitating the application of the combat element in their strategy, though attacking foragers and grain gatherers were also intrinsic to the logistic aspect of their campaign.\"<ref>Dando-Collins. Caesar's legions. 52\u201368</ref>\n\n====Roman infantry versus mobile and guerilla warfare in Hispania====\n:'''The Iberian zone of struggle.''' The Gallic-Celtic-Iberian peoples, like many other tribes, descended from the general \"Celtic\" race, put up an obstinate fight against Roman hegemony. Based in [[Hispania]] (what is now Spain and Portugal), they fought continuously, with varying levels of intensity, for almost two centuries, beginning around 218 BC. The initial hegemons of Hispania were the Carthaginians who struggled against various tribes to carve out colonies and a commercial empire, primarily in coastal enclaves. Carthaginian defeats by Rome brought struggle against a new imperium. Tribes such as the [[Celtiberi]] carried out a strong resistance, a struggle later continued by other groups such as the [[Lusitani]], under [[Viriathus]]. The [[Lusitanian War]] and the [[Numantine War]] are but a few examples of the prolonged conflict, which cut across 20 decades of Roman history. Full conquest was not achieved until the time of [[Augustus]]. The vicious long-term fighting made Hispania a place of dread for the Roman soldier. Historian Sir Edward Creasy, in his \"[[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]]\" had this to say about the Iberian conflicts.<ref>[http://www.arthurwendover.com/arthurs/history/tfdbt10.html The Fifteen Decisive Battles Of The World]: From Marathon To Waterloo by Sir Edward Creasy, M.A., 1851</ref>\n\n::\"The war against the Spaniards, who, of all the nations subdued by the Romans, defended their liberty with the greatest obstinacy... the Romans in both provinces were so often beaten, that nothing was more dreaded by the soldiers at home than to be sent there...\n\n:'''Roman tactics.''' Rome deployed its standard methods, with greater emphasis on blended units of light troops, cavalry and heavy infantry when confronting the guerrilla or mobile tactics used by the [[Iberians]]. Roman fortified camps were also valuable in protecting the troops and providing bases of operation. While combat results were mixed in the open field, the Romans did comparatively well when besieging Iberian cities, systematically eliminating enemy leaders, supply bases and centres of resistance. Destruction of Iberian resources by burning grain fields or demolishing villages also put the native resistance under greater pressure. The operations of Scipio during the [[Numantine War]] illustrate these methods, including a crackdown on lax practices and tightening of legionary discipline.<ref name=\"livius.org\">[https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_00.html ''History of Rome: The Spanish Wars'', by Appian, circa 165 A.D.]</ref> Other Roman tactics touched on the political sphere such as the \"pacification\" treaties of Gracchus, and treachery and trickery, as in the massacres of tribal leaders by [[Lucullus]] and [[Galba]] under guise of negotiation. Rome frequently capitalized on divisions among the tribes. A \"divide and conquer\" policy was in use, with competing (and sometimes insincere) treaties being negotiated to isolate targeted groups, and allied tribes being used to subdue others.<ref>Appian, op. cit.</ref>\n\n:'''Celtic-Iberian tactics.''' Fighting for their independence and survival, the Iberian tribes used fortified cities or strongpoints to defend against their enemies and mixed this with mobile warfare in formations ranging from small [[guerrilla]] bands to large units numbering thousands of men. The Celtic/Iberian horsemen, in particular, appear to be more than a match for those of Rome, a fact proved in earlier years by the key role such allied cavalry played in Hannibal's victories. Favourable mobility and knowledge of the local terrain were to help the tribes immensely. One of the most successful ambushes was pulled off by a chieftain named Carus, who liquidated around 6,000 Romans in a combined cavalry-infantry strike. Another was executed by [[Caesarus]], who took advantage of a disorderly Roman pursuit under [[Mummius]], to lay a trap that resulted in Roman losses of around 9,000 men. A similar Iberian \"turn and fight\" gambit is also recorded as being successful against [[Galba]]. Roman arms however triumphed over two grinding centuries of conflict. See ''\"[[Appian]]'s History of Rome: The Spanish Wars\"'' for a more detailed discussion of individual battles, leaders and engagements.<ref name=\"livius.org\"/>\n\n===Victory through attrition===\nIn their battles against a wide variety of opponents, Rome's ruthless persistence, greater resources and stronger organization wore down their opponents over time.<ref>John Warry, Warfare in the classical world, University of Oklahoma Press</ref> Rome's massive manpower supply was the foundation of this approach. Opponents could be relentlessly weakened and exhausted over the long run.<ref>Fronda, 2010. Between Rome and Carthage.. p38</ref> In Spain, resources were thrown at the problem until it yielded over 150 years later\u2014a slow, harsh grind of endless marching, constant sieges and fighting, broken treaties, burning villages and enslaved captives. As long as the Roman Senate and its successors were willing to replace and expend more men and material decade after decade, victory could be bought through a strategy of exhaustion.<ref>Robert Asprey, ''War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History'', Vol 1, Doubleday, 1975, p 21-30</ref>\n\nThe systematic wastage and destruction of enemy economic and human resources were called ''vastatio'' by the Romans. Crops and animals were destroyed or carried off, and local populaces were massacred or enslaved. Sometimes these tactics were also used to conduct punitive raids on barbarian tribes which had performed raids across the border. In the campaigns of Germanicus, Roman troops in the combat area carried out a \"scorched earth\" approach against their Germanic foes, devastating the land they depended on for supplies. ''\"The country was wasted by fire and sword fifty miles round, nor sex nor age found mercy; places sacred and profane had the equal lot of destruction, all razed to the ground..\"'' (Tacitus, ''Annals''). The Roman \"grind down\" approach is also seen in the Bar Kokba Jewish revolt against the Romans. The Roman commander Severus avoided meeting the hard-fighting Jewish rebels in the open field. Instead, he relied on attacking their fortified strongpoints and devastating the zone of conflict in a methodical campaign.<ref>Richard Gottheil, Samuel Krauss, \"Bar-Kokba and The Bar-Kokba War\", ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'', 2002, See also ''Hist. Rom.'' lxix. ch. 12-14 of Dio Cassius for details on the massive Jewish Revolt.</ref> This \"attritional\" aspect of the Roman approach to combat contrasts with the notion of brilliant generalship or tactics sometimes seen in popular depictions of the Roman infantry.\n\nSome historians note however that Rome often balanced brutal attrition with shrewd diplomacy, as demonstrated by Caesar's harsh treatment of Gallic tribes that opposed him, but his sometimes conciliatory handling of those that submitted. Rome also used a variety of incentives to encourage cooperation by the elites of conquered peoples, co-opting opposition and incorporating them into the structure of the empire. This carrot and stick approach forms an integral part of \"the Roman way\" of war.<ref>Archer Jones, ''The Art of War in the Western World'', University of Illinois Press: 1987, pp. 34-92, 267-381</ref>\n\n====Resource tactics====\nAs with any military organization, training soldiers/armies requires a number of things and could prove to be quite costly in the long run. The Romans understood this concept very well and realized that training soldiers could include paying for his rations ''[food]'', his salary, his armour, his armaments ''[weapons]'', and a soldier\u2019s honorarium ''[which was paid to those who received honourable discharges]''. With all this in perspective, they realized each individual soldier was a far too valuable resource to waste. They knew the costs they were incurring for each soldier had to be quite similar on their enemy\u2019s side. So they developed a tactic that could cause a significant setback or even defeat for their enemy while only creating a limited risk for their own soldiers. This was known as \u201cResource Tactics.\u201d Standing armies run on their stomachs and their equipment, and both require regular supplies. \"Resource Tactics\" cut off their opponents from resources in one of three ways:\n\n#Attack resource locations: Once they conquered territory, the Romans would secure as many resources as they could handle. This allowed them to restock their own supply and prevent the available resources from falling into their opponents' hands.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\">http://romanmilitary.net/strategy/resource</ref>\n#Intercept supplies while in transit: The Romans would identify their enemies' main supply routes and create a ''stopping point.'' Once the enemy was stopped, the Romans would ransack the supply, which would drastically reduce the supplies reaching the enemy.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\"/>\n#Conduct a \u201csiege\u201d ''[siege - a military operation in which troops surround a place and cut off all outside access to force surrender]'': The Romans would typically build a wall around the existing city to help control the enemy. This wall would be built out of reach of the archers and would prevent the enemy from escaping. Once the Romans completed the wall, they would use catapults, ballistas and onagers to hurl rocks, spears, and other objects from safe distances. The ongoing siege would eventually cause the city/fort to run out of resources, thus causing the opponents to die off or surrender.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\"/>\n\nThe basic principle behind these tactics was to disrupt their enemies' resources while increasing Roman resources. Without a regular supply of food, water, and other commodities, armies would begin to starve or dehydrate, resulting in low morale or killing of fellow soldiers.<ref name=\"romanmilitary.net\"/>\n\n===Roman infantry versus cavalry===\n\n====Tactical problems of fighting cavalry====\nCavalry opponents were one of the toughest challenges faced by the Roman infantry. Combining both missile and shock capability with extensive mobility, cavalry exploited the inherent weakness of the legion\u2014its relatively slow movement and deployment. Defeat by strong cavalry forces is a recurring event in Roman military history. The campaigns of Hannibal illustrate this well, as [[Numidian]] and Spanish/Gallic horsemen repeatedly outflanked Roman formations, dealing devastating blows in the sides and rear. Hannibal's great victory at Cannae (considered one of the greatest Roman defeats ever) was primarily an infantry struggle, but the key role was played by his cavalry, as in his other victories.\n\nAn even more dramatic demonstration of Roman vulnerability is shown in the numerous wars against [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] heavy cavalry. The Parthians and their successors used large numbers of fast-moving light riders to harass and skirmish, and delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce with heavily armoured lancers called \"[[cataphract]]s\". Both types of troops used powerful composite bows that shot arrows of sufficient strength to penetrate Roman armour. The cataphracts extended combat power by serving as shock troops, engaging opposing forces with their heavy lances in thundering charges after they had been \"softened up\" by swarms of arrows. The Parthians also conducted a \"scorched earth\" policy against the Romans, refusing major set-piece encounters, while luring them deeper on to the unfavorable ground, where they would lack water supplies and a secure line of retreat. The debacle of the [[Battle of Carrhae]] saw a devastating defeat of Roman arms by the Parthian cavalry.<ref>Denison, ''History of Cavalry'', op. cit</ref> Crassus' force was systematically dismembered by the smaller Parthians army, who surprised Roman expectations that they would run out of arrows, by arranging for a supply train of ammunition borne by thousands of camels.  Roman casualties were approcimately 20,000 killed and 10,000 captured making the battle one of the costliest defeats in Roman history. Parthian casualties were minimal.<ref>Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 31.7.</ref>\n\n====Successful tactics====\nClues exist in the earlier campaigns of Alexander the Great against mounted Asiatic warriors\u2014engaging the horsemen with strong detachments of light infantry and missile troops and driving them off with charges by Alexander's heavy cavalry units. The Roman variant, with its large manpower resources, continued the same \"combined arms\" approach, with a larger role for cavalry as the empire went on. The Eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]], particularly, was ultimately to rely mostly on cavalry forces.\n\n'''Adjustments of Ventidius.''' The operations of the Roman commander [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] illustrate three general tactics used by the infantry to fight their mounted foes. These drew on Caesar's veteran legions and made Ventidius one of the Roman generals to celebrate a triumph against the Parthians. In three separate battles, he not only managed to defeat the Parthian armies and drive them out of the Roman territory but also managed to kill Parthia's three top military commanders during the battles.<ref name=\"Denisonop\">Denison, op. cit</ref> The adjustments of Ventidius were as follows:<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n\n#''Increase in firepower.'' Ventidius sought to neutralize the Parthian advantage in firepower, by adding his own, and provided his legions with numerous slingers whose furious fire was instrumental in checking the Parthian horsemen during several battles. In subsequent engagements, other Roman commanders increased cavalry units and slingers, with the latter being supplied with leaden bullets which gave more range and killing power.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n#''Securing the high ground and other terrain features.'' During movement against the horsemen, special care had to be taken when crossing a mountain, ravine or bridge. In such cases, sub-sections of the legion had to be redeployed to provide covering and blocking forces until the army had safely navigated the route.<ref>Xenophon, ''Anabasis'', Loeb's Classical Library, 1998). See this classic work for a detailed discussion of anti-cavalry problems by another heavy infantry formation- the Hellenic phalanx, including the weaknesses of the hollow square formation</ref> In his three victories over the horsemen, Ventidius had his infantry secure the high ground, bolstering defensive positions and manoeuvres with withering covering fire by the slingers. Seizure of hilly terrain features hindered sweeping enemy cavalry movements, obstructed avenues of attack and provided anchor points that allowed manoeuvring detachments to counterattack, or to fall back if unfavourable conditions developed. Against the horsemen, heavy infantry units had to work closely with cavalry and light troops, and be mutually supporting, or they could be quickly isolated and destroyed.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n# ''Quick counterattack from a stable base.'' Once entering the zone of battle, Ventidius generally operated from a defensive base and did not prematurely venture on to flat terrain or allow his forces to lose cohesion as at Carrhae. He let the Parthian forces come to him after taking a strong position, and aggressively and quickly counterattacked. In two victories the Parthians were induced to attack the army camp, where they were mauled by the corps of slingers. The legions then counterattacked from this defensive anvil, light and heavy units working together to smash opposition.<ref name=\"Persia, Volume 1 1915. pg 385-386\">A history of Persia, Volume 1. 1915. By Sir Percy Molesworth Sykes. pg 385-386</ref> In one victory, Ventidius took a position on the high ground, and then dispatched a strong vanguard of cavalry against a Parthian concentration at the Syrian Gates, or narrow pass over Mount Amanus, leading from Cilicia into Syria. This vanguard was a decoy to lure the opposition forward. As the Parthians moved in for the kill, the Romans ambushed them from the flank with a detachment of slingers and infantry. Rather than wait for reinforcements by the allied force of Labenieus in the area, the Parthians decided to mount a full-scale attach on the main Roman position at dawn. Ventidius held back his forces until most of the Parthians were on the steep slope, then made a fast counterattack - his infantry covered by the slingers. The Parthians were defeated in detail and Pharnapates the Parthian commander was killed. <ref name=\"Persia, Volume 1 1915. pg 385-386\"/>In his third triumph, Ventidius again secured the high ground, the pivot of his tactics, and did not oppose a Parthian crossing of the Euphrartes. He held back his forces and let the Parthians advance to his position until they were close, then ordered a rapid counterattack- the slingers blanketing the enemy with fire, and the infantry surging forward. This quick \"combined arms counter-punch\" caught the Parthians on unfavorable terrain under a furious hail of slingstones and leaden pellets, and prevented them from destroying the legions with arrow barrages from a distance. Forced to fight at close quarters with the quickly advancing legionaires, the Parthians faltered and their leader Pacorus and his body guard were killed. The rest of their army eventually broke and retreated.<ref>Rose Mary Sheldon -2010. Rome\u2019s War in Parthia_ Blood in the Sand-Vallentine Mitchell p 60</ref>\n'''Combined arms and quick advance in later eras.''' In the later Roman empire, cavalry forces played a larger role, with the infantry in support. The campaign of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] against the [[Persia]]ns is instructive in this regard. On June 22, 363 a large-scale clash occurred near the town of Maranga. Facing an enemy that threatened to blanket his troops with a hail of arrows, and in danger of envelopment, Julian deployed his force in a crescent formation, and ordered an advance by both infantry and cavalry on the double, thwarting both dangers by closing quickly. The gambit was successful. After a long battle, the Persians withdrew- a tactical victory (albeit a costly one for the Romans according to some historians).<ref>Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'', (Thames & Hudson, 1986) p. 114-157</ref> The work of Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus offers a detailed description of the Persian campaign, including the quick charge by the heavy Roman infantry under Julian.\n:''\"To prevent the preliminary volleys of the archers from disrupting our ranks he (Julian) advanced at the double and so ruined the effect of their fire... Roman foot in close order made a mighty push and drove the serried ranks of the enemy before them...\"''\nMarcellinus's commentary also sharply contrasts the fighting spirit of the Persian infantrymen with those of Rome, stating that they had \"aversion to pitched infantry battles.\"<ref>Marcellinus, Ammianus, ''The Later Roman Empire'', translated by Hamilton, W. (Penguin, 1987). See also Chris Cornuelle, An Overview of the Sassanian Persian Military, (n.d.) retrieved from May 2008 from Iran Chamber Society http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/overview_sassanian_persian_military2.php</ref> In an earlier engagement outside the walls of Ctesiphon, Marcellinus again notes the value of the quick advance by the infantry:\n:''\"both sides fought hand-to-hand with spears and drawn swords; the quicker our men forced themselves into the enemy's line the less they were exposed to danger from arrows.\"''<ref>Marcellinus, op. cit.</ref>\n\n'''Mixed results against major cavalry enemies.''' Rome's overall record against the Parthians was favourable, although the Parthian horsemen offered stiff resistance, as it was against the horsemen of Hannibal, and some Gallic opponents. Subsequent Roman leaders like Antony invaded Parthian territory but had to withdraw after severe losses. Others like Severus and Trajan saw great success in their invasions of Mesopotamia, defeating Parthian armies through combined arms tactics.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" /> Thus, the battles of Ventidius and Julian show that the Roman infantry, when properly handled and manoeuvred, and when working in conjunction with other supporting arms like slingers, could certainly meet the challenge of an enemy cavalryman.<ref name=\"Denisonop\" />\n\n===Decline===\nAny history of the Roman infantry must grapple with the factors that led to the decline of the heavy legions that once dominated the Western world. Such decline, of course, is closely linked with the decay of other facets of Rome's economy, society and political scene. Nevertheless, some historians emphasize that the final demise of Rome was due to '''military''' defeat, however plausible (or implausible) the plethora of theories advanced by some scholars, ranging from declining tax bases, to class struggle, to mass lead poisoning.<ref>Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', pp. 43-190</ref> Two of the major factors that have occupied scholars of the military will be discussed here: barbarization and the adaptation of a \"mobile reserve\" strategy. There are a number of controversies in this area with duelling scholars advancing competing theories.\n\n====\"Barbarization\" of the heavy infantry====\n\"Barbarization\" is a common theme in many works on Rome (See [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], [[Mommsen]], [[Hans Delbr\u00fcck|Delbr\u00fcck]], et al.), and thus cannot be excluded from any analysis of its infantry forces. Essentially it is argued that the increasing barbarization of the heavy legions weakened weaponry, training, morale and military effectiveness in the long run. The weapons changes described above are but one example.<ref>Arther Ferrill,'' The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'', op. cit.</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that the use of barbarian personnel was nothing new. This is accurate, however, such use was clearly governed by \"the Roman way.\" It was the barbarian personnel who had to adapt to Roman standards and organization, not the other way around. In the twilight of the empire, this was not the case. Such practices as permitting the settlement of massive, armed barbarian populations on Roman territory, the watering down of the privilege of citizenship, increasing use of alien contingents, and relaxation or removal of traditionally thorough and severe Roman discipline, organization and control, contributed to the decline of the heavy infantry.<ref>Ferrill, ''Fall of the Roman Empire 43-190''</ref>\n\nThe settlement of the [[foederati]] for example, saw large barbarian contingents ushered on to Roman territory, with their own organization, under their own leaders. Such groupings showed a tendency to neglect \"the Roman way\" in organization, training, logistics etc., in favour of their own ideas, practices and agendas. These settlements may have bought short-term political peace for imperial elites, but their long-term effect was negative, weakening the traditional strengths of the heavy infantry in discipline, training and deployment. They also seemed to have lessened the incentive for remaining \"old Guard\" troops to adhere to such strengths, since the barbarians received equal or more favour with less effort. Indeed, such \"allied\" barbarian contingents were at times to turn on the Romans, devastating wide areas with sack and pillage and even attacking imperial army formations.<ref>Ferrill, ''Fall of the Roman Empire.. 43-190''</ref> Other writers argue that while some ancient Romans did view the world in terms of barbarians versus civilized Romans (epitomized in Hadrian's Wall of separation), the reality of Roman frontiers was a fuzzy set of interlocking zones - political, military, judicial and financial, rather than a neat linear boundary. Changes to the Roman forces that moved away from the old fighting organization order were thus the outcome of several influences, rather than simply the appearance of more, allegedly uncivilized non-Romans.<ref>Hugh Elton, 2012, Frontiers of the Roman Empire, pg 36-131</ref>\n\n====Changes in the legions====\nTo combat the more frequent raids and advances of their hostile neighbours the legions were changed from slow and heavy to much lighter troops, and cavalry was introduced as a serious concept. State-controlled factories produced vast quantities of less specialist arms such as chainmail armour and spears as opposed to the gladius and lorica segmentata more prevalent in the early empire. The difference between auxiliaries and legionaries began to become negligible from an equipment point of view. This meant that the new subdivided infantry lost the awesome power that the earlier legions had, meaning that whilst they were more likely to see a battle they were less likely to win it. That legion size was at an all-time low was also a factor. On the other hand, legions in the late empire were used far more flexibly as accounts by authors like Ammianus Marcellinus make clear. Smaller detachments waged more personal and smaller scale, yet intense operations against tribal foes on the Rhine and Danubian frontiers. Instead of vast formations of thousands of troops, smaller units would engage smaller-scale incursions by raiders.\n[[Roman horsemen]], while fast, were actually much too weak to cope with the very cavalry based invasions of the Huns, Goths, Vandals and Sassanids. Their ineffectiveness was demonstrated at [[Cannae]] and [[Adrianople]]; in both instances, the cavalry was completely destroyed by a vastly more powerful enemy horse. Advances in Roman tactical thinking led to the adoption of eastern-style cataphracts and mass-use of auxiliary forces as cavalry, both of which were used to address previous shortcomings of the Roman army. The later Roman army was more cavalry-orientated than it had been before and as a result, detachments were able to be moved around the empire at will, ending the previous doctrine of keeping all forces on the frontiers at the edge of the empire.\n\n====The mobile forces approach====\n\nThe \"mobile reserve\" strategy, traditionally identified with [[Constantine I]], saw a reversal of the traditional \"forward\" policy of strong frontier fortifications backed by legions stationed near likely zones of conflict. Instead, it is argued that the best troops were pulled back into a type of \"mobile reserve\" closer to the centre that could be deployed to trouble areas throughout the empire. Some scholars claim this was a positive development, (Luttwak, [[Delbruck]], et al.) given growing difficulties with governing the vast empire, where political turmoil and severe financial difficulties had made the old preclusive security system untenable. Some writers such as Luttwak condemn the old-style \"forward\" policy as indicating a \"[[Maginot Line]]\" mentality in the troubled latter centuries of the Empire.<ref>Edward Luttwak, ''Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', (The Johns Hopkins University Press 1979)</ref>\n\n'''Disadvantages of the mobile reserve strategy versus the \"forward\" policy'''\n\nAncient writers like [[Zosimus]] in the 5th century AD condemned the \"reserve\" policy as a major weakening of the military force. Other modern scholars (Ferrill et al.) also see the pullback as a strategic mistake, arguing that it left lower quality \"second string\" limitanei forces to stop an enemy until the distant mobile reserve arrived. While the drop in quality did not happen immediately, it is argued that over time, the limitanei declined into lightly armed, static watchman type troops that were of dubious value against increasing barbarian marauders on the frontiers. The pullback of the best infantry was based more on political reasons (shoring up the power bases of the emperors and various elites) rather than on military reality. In addition, it is claimed, the \"forward\" policy was not at all a static \"Maginot\" approach, but that traditional heavy legions and supporting cavalry could still move to a trouble spot by redeploying them from fortifications elsewhere along a particular frontier. Some scholars challenge the notion that a \"mobile reserve\" in the modern military sense existed in the Roman Empire, and instead argue that the shifts in an organization represent a series of field armies deployed in various areas as needed, particularly in the East. Others point to the heavy fiscal difficulties and political turmoil of the later Empire that made it difficult to continue a traditional policy.<ref name=\"Ferrillop\">Ferrill, op. cit</ref>\n\n===Twilight of the hard-core infantry===\nThere are numerous other facets to the controversy, but whatever the school of thought, all agree that the traditional strengths and weaponry of the heavy infantry legion declined from the standards of earlier eras. The 4th-century writer [[Vegetius]], in one of the most influential Western military works ''[[De Re Militari]]'', highlighted this decline as the key factor in military weakness, noting that the core legions always fought as part of an integrated team of cavalry and light foot. In the latter years, this formula that had brought so much success petered out. Caught between the growth of lighter armed/less organized foot soldiers, and the increasing cavalry formations of the mobile forces, the \"heavies\" as the dominant force, withered on the vine. This does not mean that heavy units disappeared entirely, but that their mass recruitment, formation, organization and deployment as the dominant part of the Roman military was greatly reduced. Ironically, in Rome's final battles (the Western half of the empire) the defeats suffered were substantially inflicted by infantry forces (many fighting dismounted).<ref name=\"Ferrillop\" />\n\nSpeaking of the decline of the heavy infantry, the Roman historian [[Vegetius]] lauded the old fighting units, and lamented how the heavy armour of the early days had been discarded by the weaker, less disciplined, barbarized forces:\n:''\"Those who find the old arms so burdensome, must either receive wounds upon their naked bodies and die, or what is worse still, run the risk of being made prisoners, or of betraying the country by their flight. Thus, to avoid fatigue, they allow themselves to be butchered shamefully, like cattle.\"''<ref>Quoted in Denison, p. 92</ref>\n\nHistorian Arther Ferrill notes that even towards the end, some of the old infantry formations were still in use. Such grouping was increasingly ineffective, however, without the severe close order discipline, drill and organization of old times.<ref name=\"Ferrillop\" /> At the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] (circa 451 AD) [[Attila the Hun]] rallied his troops by mocking the once-vaunted Roman infantry, alleging that they merely huddled under a screen of protective shields in close formation. He ordered his troops to ignore them and to attack the powerful [[Alans]] and [[Visigoths]] instead. It was a sad commentary on the force that had once dominated Europe, the Mediterranean and much of the Middle East. It is true that at Ch\u00e2lons, the Roman infantry contributed to the victory by seizing part of the battlefield's high ground. Nevertheless, its day had already passed in favour of the mass levies of the barbarian federates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Assessment of the Roman infantry===\n\n====Central factors in Roman success====\nSome elements that made the Romans an effective military force, both tactically and at higher levels, were:\n\n'''The Romans were able to copy and adapt the weapons and methods of their opponents more effectively.''' Some weapons, such as the [[gladius]], were adopted outright by the legionaries. Publius asserts that the ''pilum'' was of Samnite origin, and the shield was based on Greek design.<ref>Grimal, op. cit</ref> In other cases, especially formidable units of enemy forces were invited to serve in the Roman army as auxiliaries after peace was made. In the naval sphere, the Romans followed some of the same methods they used with the infantry, dropping their ineffective designs and copying, adapting and improving on Punic warships, and introducing heavier marine contingents (infantry fighters) on to their ships.<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, The Punic Wars, 98-162\">Goldsworthy, The Punic Wars, 98-162</ref>\n\n'''Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents.''' Compared to the tightly packed spearmen of the phalanx, the Roman heavy infantry, through their training and discipline, and operating in conjunction with light foot and cavalry, could quickly adopt a number of methods and formations depending on the situation. These range from the [[Testudo formation]] during [[siege warfare]], to a hollow square against cavalry attack, to mixed units of heavy foot, horse and light infantry against guerrillas in Spain, to the classic \"triple line\" or checkerboard patterns. Against more sophisticated opponents the Romans also showed great flexibility at times, such as the brilliant adjustments Scipio made against Hannibal at Zama. These included leaving huge gaps in the ranks to trap the charging elephants, and the recall, reposition and consolidation of a single battle line that advanced to the final death struggle against the Carthaginian veterans of Italy.<ref>Goldsworthy, op. cit</ref>\n\n'''Roman discipline, organization and logistical systemization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period.''' Notably, the Roman system of ''[[castra]]'', or fortified camps, allowed the army to stay in the field on favourable ground and be rested and resupplied for battle. Well organized Roman logistics also sustained combat power, from routine resupply and storage to the construction of military roads, to state-run [[arsenal]]s and weapons factories, to well organized naval convoys that helped stave off defeat by [[Carthage]]. The death of a leader generally did not cause the legions to lose heart in battle. Others stepped to the fore and carried on. In the defeat by Hannibal at the [[Trebbia River|River Trebia]], 10,000 Romans cut their way through the debacle to safety, maintaining [[unit cohesion]] when all around was rout, a testimony to their tactical organization and discipline.<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, The Punic Wars, 98-162\"/>\n\n'''The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents.''' Unlike other civilizations, the Romans kept going relentlessly until typically their enemies had been completely crushed or neutralized. The army acted to implement policy and were not allowed to stop unless they received a command from the emperor or a decree from the senate.\n\nAgainst the tribal polities of Europe, particularly in [[Hispania]], Roman tenacity and material weight eventually wore down most opposition. The tribes of Europe did not have a state or economic structure able to support lengthy campaigns and therefore could often (but not always) be made to change their minds about opposing Roman hegemony. The defeat in the Teutoburg Forest might seem like an exception, but even here, the Romans were back on the warpath 5 years later with major forces against their Germanic opponents. That their persistence was not actually endless does not negate the general pattern.\n\nWhere the Romans faced another large state structure, such as the Parthian Empire, they found the military road rocky indeed and were sometimes forced to an impasse. Nevertheless, the distinct pattern of Roman tenacity holds. Rome suffered its greatest defeats against sophisticated Carthage, notably at Cannae, and was forced to avoid a battle for a lengthy period. Yet in time, it rebuilt its forces on land and at sea, and persisted in the struggle, astonishing the Punics who expected it to sue for peace. Against the Parthians, crushing defeats did not stop the Romans from inflicting serious defeats on the Parthians themselves, for they invaded [[Parthia]]n territory several times afterwards, and though Parthia proper was never totally conquered, Rome ultimately secured a rough hegemony in the area and managed to successfully destroy Parthian forces in Mesopotamia on numerous occasions.\n\n'''Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.''' Leadership debacles are common in Roman military history, from the routs against Hannibal to the demise of the unlucky [[Crassus]] against the Parthians. The Roman polity's structuring, however, produced a steady supply of men willing and able to lead troops in battle- men that were held accountable for defeat or malfeasance. It was not unusual for a losing general to be prosecuted by political enemies in Rome, with some having their property confiscated and barely escaping death. The senatorial oligarchy, for all its political manoeuvring, interference and other faults, provided the functions of oversight and audit over military matters, that over the course of time, shaped final results. The record is a mixed one, but whether under boisterous [[Republic]] or Imperial emperor, Rome produced enough competent leaders to secure its military dominance for over a millennium. Some of the best leaders come from both eras, including Marius, Sulla, Scipio, Caesar, Trajan and others.\n\nNote should be taken here of a large number of junior officers the Romans typically used to assure coordination and guidance. The initiative of such men played a key part in Roman success. Effective leadership was also bound up with the famous Roman [[centurion]]s, the backbone of the legionary organization. While not all such men could be considered models of perfection, they commanded substantial respect.\n\n'''Rome's massive manpower supply enabled it to stay in the field and continue fighting after defeats and to launch new campaigns.''' Against Hannibal for example, Rome suffered huge losses, but still vastly outnumbered Hannibal's forces. This meant not only defensive operations under Fabius but the aggressive deployment of new armies under Scipio to take the battle to the Carthaginians in Africa. Other enemies of Rome came up against this massive manpower reserve and faltered over time - from small tribes, city-states or kingdoms fighting to maintain their independence, to major empires that confronted the Romans. The huge pool of fighting men gave the Romans much more room for error or setbacks, compared to their opponents.<ref>Michael Fronda (2010) Between Rome and Carthage.. p. 38</ref>\n\n'''The influence of the Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.''' Such culture included but was not limited to: (a) the valuing of Roman citizenship, (b) the broad-based muster of free males into mass infantry units (as opposed to widespread use of foreign contingents, [[slave]]s or mercenaries), and (c) loyalty to those fighting units (the Legion) which remained characteristically Roman in outlook and discipline. Citizenship conveyed certain valuable rights in Roman society, and was another element that helped to promote the standardization and integration of the infantry.<ref>Grimal, ''The Civilization of Rome'', p. 98-102</ref> The citizen underarms - the legion soldier - was supposed to reflect and practice the Roman ideal of ''virtus, pietas, fides'', - self-discipline, respect and faithfulness to engagements. Implementation of such ideals could be mixed according to some writers, but it was \"a trilogy [driving] every aspect of military, domestic, economic and social life.\"<ref>Grimal, p. 104</ref> As such it was a strong force for cohesion among Rome's infantrymen.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome|War}}\n* [[Campaign history of the Roman military]]\n* ''[[Castra]]''\n* [[List of Ancient Rome-related topics]]\n* [[Military history of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Roman legion]]\n* [[Roman military personal equipment]]\n* [[Structure of the Roman military]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n;Primary sources\n* Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''\n* Vegetius's ''[[De Re Militari]]''\n* ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''\n\n;Secondary sources\n*'Later Roman Battle Tactics' in C.

Although born in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] Jones spent his early life growing up in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. From early on, Jones developed both an artistic interest in drawing and the physical act of building. Jones\u2019 interest in physical design continued to grow during highschool grade 11 when he was enrolled in a class that taught drafting.<ref name=\":1\" /> This eventually drove him to pursue post secondary to achieve both a bachelors and a masters degree. In 1995, Jones received a bachelor's degree in Environmental Design at the [[University of Manitoba]] followed by a bachelor of Environmental Design Studies at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (TUNS)(which merged into what is now [[Dalhousie University]]) in 1997.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Shortly after, he returned back to the University of Manitoba where he completed his masters in Architecture in 1999.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nDuring his time still as an undergrad student in university, Jones was already designing architecture that made its way into physical realization. His first real project was a commission done in 1996 by his own parents asking him to design their home.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/features/article/150068361/vancouver-based-d-arcy-jones-architecture-stays-small-to-maintain-intimacy-with-their-work|title=Vancouver Based D'Arcy Jones Architecture Stays Small to Maintain Intimacy With Their Work|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> During this time, Jones claims that the project made him appreciate and \u201cfall in love\u201d with factors that were not taught in architecture school, such as the practical and technical characteristics of architecture.<ref name=\":5\" /> The success of this solo project caused him to find his own practice after graduating from masters in 1999, where he would officially start practicing alone from the years 2000-2005.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> During these early times as a solo practice, Jones was based out of his personal house located in Vancouver\u2019s west end.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nProfessionally, Jones followed a path that was considered abnormal and non-traditional. As typically seen in Canada (where he would eventually practice) and many other parts of the world, the licensing process remains very strict and orderly in terms of how to achieve official registration as a practicing architect. With respect to contemporary licensing, the process follows a structure where an individual with a Masters of Architecture degree will work under the title of \u2018[[Intern architect|intern]]\u2019 through already established firms. Instead, Jones founded his own practice,\u00a0right after graduating in 1999 and has been self-employed ever since.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Unlike in a normal intern employment situation where a registered architect will supervise and sign off on one\u2019s \u2018working hours,\u2019 Jones never traditionally interned and obtained his hours remaining as a solo practice by collaborations and joint ventures. He states in an interview that he used joint ventures with registered architects as a means to carry out projects and complete his \u2018internship.\u2019<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAfter 5 years of solo practice, Jones moved the practice from his own home into an office space in Mount Pleasant in 2005.<ref name=\":1\" /> From here Jones officially founded D\u2019Arcy Jones Architecture (currently known as D\u2019Arcy Jones Architects) where he expanded his studio size to a humble 9 person team including himself.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Although technically involved with architectural practice since the conception of his firm in 2000, Jones achieved being a registered architect in 2013.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs an established architect and practice, Jones actively involves himself and contributes within the field of architecture through talk panels, design competitions, lecturing, juries, and teaching. In 2015, Jones was taken on by the University of British Columbia to be an adjunct professor within their schools of Architecture and Landscape Architecture where things like studio teaching, critiquing and being a thesis advisor are carried out.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Most recently, he was invited by the [[University of Calgary]] as a guest critic for students\u2019 within the Faculty of Environmental Design.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n== Design Approach ==\nD\u2019Arcy Jones has always been recognized for his boutique residential houses ever since completing his very first project as a student. To this day, Jones has gained respect through his most notable works and completed projects which fall largely under the typology of single residential housing.<ref name=\":6\" /> Alongside the natural evolution of the firm, projects encompassing a broader typology but keeping in similar scale include galleries, renovations, interiors, commercial and gallery spaces.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nJones\u2019 projects focus greatly on the exploration and combination of program together with proportion, and how site and materiality shape it. Furthermore, these aspects help DJA explore the technicalities of details and construction as integral parts of the design process.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nJones has always been a proponent of the deeper characteristics of sustainability and inherently is seen translated into DJA\u2019s project designs and philosophies.<ref name=\":5\" /> As seen through Vancouver's First Shaughnessy Design Panel, Jones was actively involved representing the [[Architectural Institute of British Columbia]] ([[Architectural Institute of British Columbia|AIBC]]). This was a panel that fundamentally helped establish Vancouver\u2019s prohibition against demolishing heritage houses that dated before the 1940\u2019s.<ref name=\":0\" /> From a design perspective, DJA\u2019s philosophy encourages the integration of modern expression by using existing buildings as a starting point or blank canvas.<ref name=\":1\" /> In many of DJA\u2019s projects, intensive renovations and adaptive reuse of existing homes seems to be where opportunities in showcasing sustainability take place through innovation and thoughtful recycling.<ref name=\":2\" /> As stated by Jones, \"the greenest building is the one already built,\" and this further encourages their projects to address material efficiently and re imagine innovative sustainable designs to introduce things like passive cooling and breezes to save energy.<ref name=\":5\" /> Through their designs, Jones\u2019 also encourages design sustainability through key factors like favoring common and local building materials over nonnative and foreign ones.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This ultimately challenges Jones to push the possibilities and innovations of such conventional materials and construction practices.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAdding to DJA\u2019s design philosophy, they are well recognized for their feasibility in both economics and physical craftsmanship. DJA prides itself on delivering high quality design that challenge but also push traditional methods of construction.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ever since Jones\u2019 first project, he developed an appreciation for physical craftsmanship and construction that he further encourages and promotes through his own designs.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This is done through the practice\u2019s intricate detail design work together with the strong realization of construction realities.<ref name=\":5\" /> Together with strong relationships with local builders and labourers, the bespoke design work is still intended to be able to be carried out by the majority of construction workers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn response to the scale and level of detailed work produced by DJA, it has always been an intensive studio culture where everyone ranging from interns to seniors are all in charge of leading 2-3 projects each. Jones believes this allows projects and workers to have a better rounded perspective rather than more traditional hierarchies seen in other firms.<ref name=\":1\" /> Starting at a 9 person office, Jones\u2019 states that he does not intend to surpass 15 people as the focus and intimacy of project details and design will be lost which goes against his practice\u2019s philosophy.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Jones' personal design influences consist of a wide, ever-changing variety of architects but states that despite the immediate rotation, \"I often come back to earlier influences.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://graymag.com/2019/05/13/architect-darcy-jones-chooses-paths-less-traveled/|title=Architect D\u2019Arcy Jones Chooses Paths Less Traveled|last=May 13|first=Kathrine Guzik|last2=2019|date=2019-05-13|website=GRAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n== Notable Projects ==\n'''Friesen Wong House'''\n\nThe Friesen Wong House is a custom single family residential house that additionally features a pottery studio and shop area.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/friesen-wong-house|title=Friesen Wong House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The siting of the house takes place on a rocky hilltop that overlooks the topography of the surrounding [[Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area|Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> The house was designed bespoke to cater towards the lifestyle of the owners Jon Friesen and Silping Wong.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwell.com/home/friesen-wong-residence-d2020448|title=Friesen-Wong Residence Modern Home in British Columbia, Canada by\u2026|website=Dwell|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> This meant a design integrated within nature that responded to their lifestyle surrounding heavily on outdoor activities.<ref name=\":11\" /> Jon states that the was imagined to be an \"extension of the park\" where the house grew out of the land rather than being an object building that disrupted the landscape. Jon also states that the house was imagined to embody the surrounding park despite where you were located within the house, as if always \"walking around the park.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> Jones ultimately responds to this design vision by translating the house into a sturdy and tough built form to respond to the site but also gracefully being sited within the landscape.<ref name=\":11\" /> The house focuses an emphasis on innovative sustainable and economic features. A prominent concrete cantilever structure together with structural insulated panel building technology (SIPS) was designed to work in tandem with small steel pins to help support the floor slab and ultimately create a thermal break to ensure a continuous insulation layer.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Other structural innovations include a concrete block column that was used hollowed out to render a fireplace on the interior.<ref name=\":11\" /> On the interior, \"saddlebag\" storage units increase temperature control and have allowed cutback on glazing costs.<ref name=\":11\" /> For materiality, the house chooses to showcase its permanence with materials like steel, concrete, and charred wood that require little upkeep.<ref name=\":11\" /> The cladding was done in a Douglas Fir wood that is native to the region. Together with his father, Jon personally charred the wood using a technique called traditional Japanese wood preserving technique called [[Yakisugi|shou sugi ban]] to protect against weathering and insect erosion.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Frieson Wong House went on to win a handful of awards, most notably the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia Awards in Architecture (2017).<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\n'''Double Header House'''\n\nThe Double Header House is single residential housing project designed to house 3 generations of one family under one roof. The house is split into two main units: one housing the main family and kids, and the other housing the grandparents, and public and private access to both units through a communal staircase.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/darcy-jones-creates-a-multi-gen-marvel-in-victoria-b-c/|title=D'Arcy Jones Creates a Multi-Gen Marvel in Victoria, B.C.|date=2019-11-25|website=Azure Magazine|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> This unique living condition was determined by the local zoning in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria BC]] that prevented the development of a duplex on the site, but instead allowed for a main building accompanied with a secondary suite.<ref name=\":12\" /> The plan layout consists of both living suites to be facing each other in a north-south orientation rather than a typical side-by-side layout seen in duplexes. This would allow both spaces to feel a sense of width close to a \"typical house\".<ref name=\":12\" /> What is most unique about the house is the origami like metal overhangs identical on both facades. This important design element helps mitigate sunlight coming into the house but still provides enough light into the interior. This overhang also helps with the privacy of people looking in.<ref name=\":12\" />\n \n'''Deep Cove House'''\n\nThe Deep Cove House is single residential house located in [[Deep Cove, North Vancouver]]. As Jones describes, the house was designed to be \"part look-out tower, part courtyard and part land form.\" <ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/07/deep-cove-house-darcy-jones-architects-vancouver/|title=D'Arcy Jones defines Deep Cove House with slanted wood-clad walls|date=2019-11-07|website=Dezeen|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.dal.ca/news/deep-cove-house-by-darcy-jones-beds-97-architects-selected-as-one-of-dezeens-top-10-canadian-houses-of-2019/|title=D'Arcy Jones (BEDS'97) Architects takes 2019 top magazine honours!|date=2019-12-17|website=Dalhousie Alumni|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/deep-cove-house|title=Deep Cove House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The house is sited on top a clifftop in Deep Cove where ultimately this multi-functioning form and program came to realization. The exterior of the house is designed with contrasting facades: the public street-facing one being completely closed off with no glazing versus the backside with extensive wrap-around windows.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is to allow for minimal views into the house from the public and nearby commercial streets and maximizes the expansive views overlooking the surrounding forest and water.<ref name=\":13\" /> The building's sharp angles also help combat and minimize exterior glare and promote water runoff.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\" />. The interior was designed around a minimalist and modest yet flexible plan.<ref name=\":13\" /> This meant a simple grey-scale colour palette with minimalistic furniture. This was designed with inspiration from older architectural ideals of creating rooms with no given program and instead allow a multitude of programs/uses to form to a generic room.<ref name=\":13\" /> This would ultimately allow for the exterior views to be the highlight rather than interior.<ref name=\":13\" /> \n\nThe Deep Cove House was selected in 2019 as one of [[Dezeen]]'s Top 10 Canadian Houses.<ref name=\":14\" />\n== Awards and Achievements ==\nD\u2019arcy Jones Architects has been the recipient of many awards and achievements.

Although born in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] Jones spent his early life growing up in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. From early on, Jones developed both an artistic interest in drawing and the physical act of building. Jones\u2019 interest in physical design continued to grow during highschool grade 11 when he was enrolled in a class that taught drafting.<ref name=\":1\" /> This eventually drove him to pursue post secondary to achieve both a bachelors and a masters degree. In 1995, Jones received a bachelor's degree in Environmental Design at the [[University of Manitoba]] followed by a bachelor of Environmental Design Studies at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (TUNS)(which merged into what is now [[Dalhousie University]]) in 1997.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Shortly after, he returned back to the University of Manitoba where he completed his masters in Architecture in 1999.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nDuring his time still as an undergrad student in university, Jones was already designing architecture that made its way into physical realization. His first real project was a commission done in 1996 by his own parents asking him to design their home.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/features/article/150068361/vancouver-based-d-arcy-jones-architecture-stays-small-to-maintain-intimacy-with-their-work|title=Vancouver Based D'Arcy Jones Architecture Stays Small to Maintain Intimacy With Their Work|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> During this time, Jones claims that the project made him appreciate and \u201cfall in love\u201d with factors that were not taught in architecture school, such as the practical and technical characteristics of architecture.<ref name=\":5\" /> The success of this solo project caused him to find his own practice after graduating from masters in 1999, where he would officially start practicing alone from the years 2000-2005.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> During these early times as a solo practice, Jones was based out of his personal house located in Vancouver\u2019s west end.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nProfessionally, Jones followed a path that was considered abnormal and non-traditional. As typically seen in Canada (where he would eventually practice) and many other parts of the world, the licensing process remains very strict and orderly in terms of how to achieve official registration as a practicing architect. With respect to contemporary licensing, the process follows a structure where an individual with a Masters of Architecture degree will work under the title of \u2018[[Intern architect|intern]]\u2019 through already established firms. Instead, Jones founded his own practice,\u00a0right after graduating in 1999 and has been self-employed ever since.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Unlike in a normal intern employment situation where a registered architect will supervise and sign off on one\u2019s \u2018working hours,\u2019 Jones never traditionally interned and obtained his hours remaining as a solo practice by collaborations and joint ventures. He states in an interview that he used joint ventures with registered architects as a means to carry out projects and complete his \u2018internship.\u2019<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAfter 5 years of solo practice, Jones moved the practice from his own home into an office space in Mount Pleasant in 2005.<ref name=\":1\" /> From here Jones officially founded D\u2019Arcy Jones Architecture (currently known as D\u2019Arcy Jones Architects) where he expanded his studio size to a humble 9 person team including himself.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Although technically involved with architectural practice since the conception of his firm in 2000, Jones achieved being a registered architect in 2013.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs an established architect and practice, Jones actively involves himself and contributes within the field of architecture through talk panels, design competitions, lecturing, juries, and teaching. In 2015, Jones was taken on by the University of British Columbia to be an adjunct professor within their schools of Architecture and Landscape Architecture where things like studio teaching, critiquing and being a thesis advisor are carried out.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Most recently, he was invited by the [[University of Calgary]] as a guest critic for students\u2019 within the Faculty of Environmental Design.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n== Design Approach ==\nD\u2019Arcy Jones has always been recognized for his boutique residential houses ever since completing his very first project as a student. To this day, Jones has gained respect through his most notable works and completed projects which fall largely under the typology of single residential housing.<ref name=\":6\" /> Alongside the natural evolution of the firm, projects encompassing a broader typology but keeping in similar scale include galleries, renovations, interiors, commercial and gallery spaces.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nJones\u2019 projects focus greatly on the exploration and combination of program together with proportion, and how site and materiality shape it. Furthermore, these aspects help DJA explore the technicalities of details and construction as integral parts of the design process.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nJones has always been a proponent of the deeper characteristics of sustainability and inherently is seen translated into DJA\u2019s project designs and philosophies.<ref name=\":5\" /> As seen through Vancouver's First Shaughnessy Design Panel, Jones was actively involved representing the [[Architectural Institute of British Columbia]] ([[Architectural Institute of British Columbia|AIBC]]). This was a panel that fundamentally helped establish Vancouver\u2019s prohibition against demolishing heritage houses that dated before the 1940\u2019s.<ref name=\":0\" /> From a design perspective, DJA\u2019s philosophy encourages the integration of modern expression by using existing buildings as a starting point or blank canvas.<ref name=\":1\" /> In many of DJA\u2019s projects, intensive renovations and adaptive reuse of existing homes seems to be where opportunities in showcasing sustainability take place through innovation and thoughtful recycling.<ref name=\":2\" /> As stated by Jones, \"the greenest building is the one already built,\" and this further encourages their projects to address material efficiently and re imagine innovative sustainable designs to introduce things like passive cooling and breezes to save energy.<ref name=\":5\" /> Through their designs, Jones\u2019 also encourages design sustainability through key factors like favoring common and local building materials over nonnative and foreign ones.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This ultimately challenges Jones to push the possibilities and innovations of such conventional materials and construction practices.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAdding to DJA\u2019s design philosophy, they are well recognized for their feasibility in both economics and physical craftsmanship. DJA prides itself on delivering high quality design that challenge but also push traditional methods of construction.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ever since Jones\u2019 first project, he developed an appreciation for physical craftsmanship and construction that he further encourages and promotes through his own designs.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This is done through the practice\u2019s intricate detail design work together with the strong realization of construction realities.<ref name=\":5\" /> Together with strong relationships with local builders and labourers, the bespoke design work is still intended to be able to be carried out by the majority of construction workers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn response to the scale and level of detailed work produced by DJA, it has always been an intensive studio culture where everyone ranging from interns to seniors are all in charge of leading 2-3 projects each. Jones believes this allows projects and workers to have a better rounded perspective rather than more traditional hierarchies seen in other firms.<ref name=\":1\" /> Starting at a 9 person office, Jones\u2019 states that he does not intend to surpass 15 people as the focus and intimacy of project details and design will be lost which goes against his practice\u2019s philosophy.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Jones' personal design influences consist of a wide, ever-changing variety of architects but states that despite the immediate rotation, \"I often come back to earlier influences.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://graymag.com/2019/05/13/architect-darcy-jones-chooses-paths-less-traveled/|title=Architect D\u2019Arcy Jones Chooses Paths Less Traveled|last=May 13|first=Kathrine Guzik|last2=2019|date=2019-05-13|website=GRAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n== Notable Projects ==\n'''Friesen Wong House'''\n\nThe Friesen Wong House is a custom single family residential house that additionally features a pottery studio and shop area.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/friesen-wong-house|title=Friesen Wong House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The siting of the house takes place on a rocky hilltop that overlooks the topography of the surrounding [[Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area|Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> The house was designed bespoke to cater towards the lifestyle of the owners Jon Friesen and Silping Wong.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwell.com/home/friesen-wong-residence-d2020448|title=Friesen-Wong Residence Modern Home in British Columbia, Canada by\u2026|website=Dwell|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> This meant a design integrated within nature that responded to their lifestyle surrounding heavily on outdoor activities.<ref name=\":11\" /> Jon states that the was imagined to be an \"extension of the park\" where the house grew out of the land rather than being an object building that disrupted the landscape. Jon also states that the house was imagined to embody the surrounding park despite where you were located within the house, as if always \"walking around the park.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> Jones ultimately responds to this design vision by translating the house into a sturdy and tough built form to respond to the site but also gracefully being sited within the landscape.<ref name=\":11\" /> The house focuses an emphasis on innovative sustainable and economic features. A prominent concrete cantilever structure together with structural insulated panel building technology (SIPS) was designed to work in tandem with small steel pins to help support the floor slab and ultimately create a thermal break to ensure a continuous insulation layer.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Other structural innovations include a concrete block column that was used hollowed out to render a fireplace on the interior.<ref name=\":11\" /> On the interior, \"saddlebag\" storage units increase temperature control and have allowed cutback on glazing costs.<ref name=\":11\" /> For materiality, the house chooses to showcase its permanence with materials like steel, concrete, and charred wood that require little upkeep.<ref name=\":11\" /> The cladding was done in a Douglas Fir wood that is native to the region. Together with his father, Jon personally charred the wood using a technique called traditional Japanese wood preserving technique called [[Yakisugi|shou sugi ban]] to protect against weathering and insect erosion.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Frieson Wong House went on to win a handful of awards, most notably the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia Awards in Architecture (2017).<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\n\n\n'''Double Header House'''\n\nThe Double Header House is single residential housing project designed to house 3 generations of one family under one roof. The house is split into two main units: one housing the main family and kids, and the other housing the grandparents, and public and private access to both units through a communal staircase.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/darcy-jones-creates-a-multi-gen-marvel-in-victoria-b-c/|title=D'Arcy Jones Creates a Multi-Gen Marvel in Victoria, B.C.|date=2019-11-25|website=Azure Magazine|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> This unique living condition was determined by the local zoning in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria BC]] that prevented the development of a duplex on the site, but instead allowed for a main building accompanied with a secondary suite.<ref name=\":12\" /> The plan layout consists of both living suits to be be facing each other in a north-south orientation rather than a typical side-by-side layout seen in duplexes. This would allow both spaces to feel a sense of width close to a \"typical house\".<ref name=\":12\" /> What is most unique about the house is the origami like metal overhangs identical on both facades. This important design element helps mitigate sunlight coming into the house but still provides enough light into the interior. This overhang also helps with the privacy of people looking in.<ref name=\":12\" />\n \n\n\n'''Deep Cove House'''\n\nThe Deep Cove House is single residential house located in [[Deep Cove, North Vancouver]]. As Jones describes, the house was designed to be \"part look-out tower, part courtyard and part land form.\" <ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/07/deep-cove-house-darcy-jones-architects-vancouver/|title=D'Arcy Jones defines Deep Cove House with slanted wood-clad walls|date=2019-11-07|website=Dezeen|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.dal.ca/news/deep-cove-house-by-darcy-jones-beds-97-architects-selected-as-one-of-dezeens-top-10-canadian-houses-of-2019/|title=D'Arcy Jones (BEDS'97) Architects takes 2019 top magazine honours!|date=2019-12-17|website=Dalhousie Alumni|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/deep-cove-house|title=Deep Cove House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The house is sited on top a clifftop in Deep Cove where ultimately this multi-functioning form and program came to realization. The exterior of the house is designed with contrasting facades: the public street-facing one being completely closed off with no glazing versus the backside with extensive wrap-around windows.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is to allow for minimal views into the house from the public and nearby commercial streets and maximizes the expansive views overlooking the surrounding forest and water.<ref name=\":13\" /> The building's sharp angles also help combat and minimize exterior glare and promote water runoff.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\" />. The interior was designed around a minimalist and modest yet flexible plan.<ref name=\":13\" /> This meant a simple grey-scale colour palette with minimalistic furniture. This was designed with inspiration from older architectural ideals of creating rooms with no given program and instead allow a multitude of programs/uses to form to a generic room.<ref name=\":13\" /> This would ultimately allow for the exterior views to be the highlight rather than interior.<ref name=\":13\" /> \n\nThe Deep Cove House was selected in 2019 as one of [[Dezeen]]'s Top 10 Canadian Houses.<ref name=\":14\" />\n== Awards and Achievements ==\nD\u2019arcy Jones Architects has been the recipient of many awards and achievements.

Winston Co.,<ref name=\"dke\" /> a publishing firm. Winston was later acquired by Henry Holt and became part of [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]]. At Winston, Howard-Smith both edited and wrote a large number of books, mainly under the pen name Logan Marshall. These were often quickly produced and designed to satisfy public curiosity concerning a current event. As a result, Howard-Smith has been characterized as a \"hack\",<ref name=\"agents\" /> and his language criticized as \"strained, excessive, or melodramatic.\"<ref name=\"robertson\" /> Howard-Smith's (as Logan Marshall) ''The Sinking of the Titanic'', however, achieved a great deal of fame as a result of being quickly at the market, and continues to be cited in bibliographies about the incident.\n\nLogan Howard-Smith married Amelia Sparks Douglas on 22 April 1917.
