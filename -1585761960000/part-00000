It may take 2\u201314 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* On 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n|first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n|last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n|num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n|first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n|last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n|num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

In 1993, the UWF released six volumes of [[PAL]] videos in Germany through Summit International Pictures under the \"Wrestling Super Champs\" banner. They were all compilations of Fury Hour matches. The same six \"Wrestling Super Champs\" volumes were re-released in Germany through J\u00fcnger Verlag under the \"Super Wrestling\" banner.\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of UWF [[DVD]]s in Australia through Payless Entertainment. Each of the seven [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] DVDs contains one episode of ''Fury Hour''. The DVDs include ''Body Slammin'', ''Grand Slam'', ''Grudge Matches'', ''It's War'', ''Tag Team Madness'', ''The Main Event'', and ''Wrestling Wars''. In Germany, a [[DVD region code|Region 0]] DVD titled \"Wrestling Super 4 Champs\" was released containing two episodes of ''Fury Hour''.

The former is sometimes called the \"[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] for children's literature\".\n\nThe awards are named after [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the 19th-century Danish author of [[fairy tales]], and each winner receives the Hans Christian Andersen Medaille, a gold medal with the bust of Andersen (see image). Medals are presented at the biennial IBBY Congress. The Patron of the Andersen Awards is Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and the awards are sponsored by Nami Island Inc.\n\n==Process==\nNational Sections of IBBY may nominate one author and one illustrator each and the Hans Christian Andersen Award Jury considers only those nominees. National Sections also nominate the ten distinguished, international Jury Members plus the Jury President. The shortlist of nominees is presented in January and the award winners are announced at the annual [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]], in March or April.\n\nThe selection criteria include the aesthetic and literary qualities of writing and illustrating as well as the ability to see things from the child's point of view and the ability to stretch the child's curiosity and imagination. The complete works of the author and of the illustrator will be taken into consideration.\n\n==Winners==\nSee also \"Hans Christian Andersen Award Winners 1956\u20132018\"<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2019|title=Hans Christian Andersen Award Winners 1956\u20132018|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/740854|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=19\u201319|doi=10.1353/bkb.2019.0069|issn=1918-6983}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 winners are [[Eiko Kadono]] (Japan) for writing and [[Igor Oleynikov]] (Russia) for illustration.<ref name=\"HCAA2018\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibby.org/news-calendar/media-releases/2018-hcaa-winners/ |title=2018 HCAA Winners |publisher=[[International Board on Books for Young People]] |date=26 March 2018  |accessdate=11 April 2018 }}</ref> The runners-up are:\n\n* Writing: [[Marie-Aude Murail]] (France), [[Farhad Hasanzadeh]] (Iran), [[Joy Cowley]] (New Zealand), [[Ulf Stark]] (Sweden)\n* Illustration: [[Pablo Bernasconi]] (Argentina), [[Xiong Liang]] (China), [[Iwona Chmielewska]] (Poland), [[Albertine Zullo|Albertine]] (Switzerland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibby.org/awards-activities/awards/hans-christian-andersen-awards/hcaa-2018/|title=HCAA 2018: IBBY official website|website=Ibby.org|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Year !! colspan=\"2\" | Writing !! colspan=\"2\" | Illustration\n|-\n!

The former is sometimes called the \"[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] for children's literature\".\n\nThe awards are named after [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the 19th-century Danish author of [[fairy tales]], and each winner receives the Hans Christian Andersen Medaille, a gold medal with the bust of Andersen (see image). Medals are presented at the biennial IBBY Congress. The Patron of the Andersen Awards is Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and the awards are sponsored by Nami Island Inc.\n\n==Process==\nNational Sections of IBBY may nominate one author and one illustrator each and the Hans Christian Andersen Award Jury considers only those nominees. National Sections also nominate the ten distinguished, international Jury Members plus the Jury President. The shortlist of nominees is presented in January and the award winners are announced at the annual [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]], in March or April.\n\nThe selection criteria include the aesthetic and literary qualities of writing and illustrating as well as the ability to see things from the child's point of view and the ability to stretch the child's curiosity and imagination. The complete works of the author and of the illustrator will be taken into consideration.\n\n==Winners==\nSee also \"Hans Christian Andersen Award Winners 1956\u20132018\"<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2019|title=Hans Christian Andersen Award Winners 1956\u20132018|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/740854|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=19\u201319|doi=10.1353/bkb.2019.0069|issn=1918-6983}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 winners are [[Eiko Kadono]] (Japan) for writing and [[Igor Oleynikov]] (Russia) for illustration.<ref name=\"HCAA2018\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibby.org/news-calendar/media-releases/2018-hcaa-winners/ |title=2018 HCAA Winners |publisher=[[International Board on Books for Young People]] |date=26 March 2018  |accessdate=11 April 2018 }}</ref> The runners-up are:\n\n* Writing: [[Marie-Aude Murail]] (France), [[Farhad Hasanzadeh]] (Iran), [[Joy Cowley]] (New Zealand), [[Ulf Stark]] (Sweden)\n* Illustration: [[Pablo Bernasconi]] (Argentina), [[Xiong Liang]] (China), [[Iwona Chmielewska]] (Poland), [[Albertine Zullo|Albertine]] (Switzerland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibby.org/awards-activities/awards/hans-christian-andersen-awards/hcaa-2018/|title=HCAA 2018: IBBY official website|website=Ibby.org|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Year !! colspan=\"2\" | Writing !! colspan=\"2\" | Illustration\n|-\n!

It stars [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Ajay Devgn]], with [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Kajol]] portraying their love interests respectively. [[Dalip Tahil]], [[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]], [[Johnny Lever]] and [[Mohan Joshi]] appear in supporting roles. The film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 1997, behind ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'' and ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'', with a worldwide gross of {{INR}}505 million.  It is the last film to feature Khan and Chawla together onscreen. The [[Kannada language|Kannada]] remake of the film, ''[[Snehana Preethina]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRanjit Rai ([[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]]) and Harbans Lal Saxena ([[Dalip Tahil]]) are two wealthy business magnates who despise the poor. Thus, they decide their children, Ajay Rai ([[Ajay Devgan]]) and Madhu Saxena ([[Juhi Chawla]]), will marry wealthy spouses. They try to break their children's friendship with Raja ([[Aamir Khan]]) and Kajal ([[Kajol]]), who are both poor. They fix up Ajay's marriage with Madhu and send Ajay to meet Madhu. As fate would have it, Ajay falls in love with Kajal instead and Raja and Madhu fall in love. This angers the two men, and they try to bribe Raja and Kajal into leaving Madhu and Ajay. When this doesn't work, they try to get Raja and Kajal killed. When the children realize what their fathers really did, they refuse to back down, their determination set in stone.\n\nEventually, the parents play a nasty trick. They make the four lovers believe that they have changed their ways and are ready for their children to marry the person they wish to. On the way to Raja and Madhu's engagement ceremony, the fathers have Kajal kidnapped. Raja saves her from being raped and comforts her. Meanwhile, without their knowledge, photos are taken of them. The fathers then show the photos of Raja comforting Kajal at the party. Taken out of context, the photos make it look like Raja and Kajal are being intimate with each other. Raja and Kajal are willing to prove their innocence, but the fathers keep them away. To make matters worse, Kajal's uncle ([[Mohan Joshi]]) falsely testifies to the fabricated illicit affair between the two. In fact, Kajal's uncle was paid to lie to Ajay and Madhu.\n\nAjay and Madhu break up with Kajal and Raja, and the fathers' plan to create a rift between Ajay and Raja, once the best of friends, succeeds. The situation worsens further when Ajay and Madhu think that Kajal is pregnant with Raja's child. They tell Raja and Kajal that they are getting married, which is what their fathers wanted all along. After hearing this, Kajal attempts to kill herself, but Raja stops her. Raja attacks Ajay and Madhu while they are in a car mobile. Raja pretends to show that he is about to rape Madhu, but Ajay saves and comforts her. The police beat Raja brutally and Kajal pleads the fathers to release him. The fathers agree, but on the condition that Kajal and Raja leave the country for good and that they would be killed if they ever did return. Kajal agrees and Raja is set free.\n\nAjay and Madhu's wedding is about to start when Ajay's uncle ([[Johny Lever]]) shows them pictures of Ajay comforting Madhu after Ajay seemingly had saved Madhu from Rajas supposed attack, taken out of context. This proves that Raja had attacked them to recreate the situation he and Kajal had been in, which in turn proved that Raja and Kajal are innocent and that the fathers were behind the initial attack on Kajal. Further proving Raja and Kajal's innocence, Kajal's uncle also confesses that he lied out of bribery. Angry and heartbroken, Ajay almost chokes his father to death but his conscience stops him. He then tries to kill himself but Madhu stops him. Ajay and Madhu rush to the shipyard and succeed to stop Raja and Kajal from leaving the country on the ship. They ask for forgiveness and the lovers get back together. The fathers arrive, having realized their grave mistake, and also ask for forgiveness. The lovers forgive them and they sing and dance to a song.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Raja\n* [[Ajay Devgan]] as Ajay Rai\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Madhu\n* [[Kajol]] as Kajal\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Lambodar Upadhyay (Ajay's uncle)\n* [[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]] as Ranjit Rai (Ajay's father)\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Harbans Lal Saxena (Madhu's father)\n* [[Mohan Joshi]] as Madan Jindal (Kajal's uncle)\n* [[Razzak Khan]] as Nawaab naadin Dhinna Changezi\n* [[Shwetha Menon]] (dancer in song \"Humko Tumse Pyar Hai\")\n* [[Ghanashyam Nayak]] as ACP Ghanshyam Gulati (Harbans Lal's partner)\n* [[Achyut Potdar]] as Barrister Gokhale\n* [[Deepak Shirke]] as Damliya\n* [[Tiku Talsania]] as Bank manager Gaitonde\n* [[Deven Verma]] as Behram\n* [[Anant Mahadevan]] as Brijesh\n* [[Veeru Krishnan]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\nDirector [[Indra Kumar]] had initially planned to make ''Ishq'' in 1991 with [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] as two of the four leads, but due to their personal problems at the time, they opted out of the film. Later, [[Boney Kapoor]] asked Kumar to make the film with [[Sanjay Kapoor]] and [[Vivek Mushran]] playing the roles of Ajay and Raja, respectively. However, Kumar had no happiness to cast the two, and he then made the film ''[[Raja (1995 film)|Raja]]'' with Sanjay Kapoor, which released in 1995. He again came with the idea of making ''Ishq'' in 1996 and selected [[Ajay Devgn]], Aamir Khan, [[Kajol]] and [[Juhi Chawla]] to play the leads. \n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Karisma Kapoor]] and [[Madhuri Dixit]] were offered the roles of Kajol and Juhi Chawla, respectively, but the former declined to not work opposite Devgn and the latter had date issues. Along with this, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] was signed to play the role of a man who after completing an intermission tries to unite the four lovers, but due to some problems with Kumar, he left the film, and Kumar later removed that character from the film. ''Ishq'' was Kumar's first movie to not star Madhuri Dixit as a female lead and second movie with Aamir Khan after 1990's ''[[Dil (1990 film)|Dil]]''. The film also marked the first collaboration between Kumar and Devgn.\n\n===Filming===\n\nDuring the shooting of the film, Aamir Khan throwed a prank on Juhi Chawla, after which she got irritated.\n\n==Box office==\nThe movie was a blockbuster and earned \u20b953.2 crores against a budget of \u20b910 crores.<ref name=\"boi\">{{cite web |title=Ishq \u2013 Movie |url=https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=2627 |website=[[Box Office India]] |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe music was composed by Anu Malik.

It stars [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Ajay Devgn]], with [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Kajol]] portraying their love interests respectively. [[Dalip Tahil]], [[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]], [[Johnny Lever]] and [[Mohan Joshi]] appear in supporting roles. The film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 1997, behind ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'' and ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'', with a worldwide gross of {{INR}}505 million.  It is the last film to feature Khan and Chawla together onscreen. The [[Kannada language|Kannada]] remake of the film, ''[[Snehana Preethina]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRanjit Rai ([[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]]) and Harbans Lal Saxena ([[Dalip Tahil]]) are two wealthy business magnates who despise the poor. Thus, they decide their children, Ajay Rai ([[Ajay Devgan]]) and Madhu Saxena ([[Juhi Chawla]]), will marry wealthy spouses. They try to break their children's friendship with Raja ([[Aamir Khan]]) and Kajal ([[Kajol]]), who are both poor. They fix up Ajay's marriage with Madhu and send Ajay to meet Madhu. As fate would have it, Ajay falls in love with Kajal instead and Raja and Madhu fall in love. This angers the two men, and they try to bribe Raja and Kajal into leaving Madhu and Ajay. When this doesn't work, they try to get Raja and Kajal killed. When the children realize what their fathers really did, they refuse to back down, their determination set in stone.\n\nEventually, the parents play a nasty trick. They make the four lovers believe that they have changed their ways and are ready for their children to marry the person they wish to. On the way to Raja and Madhu's engagement ceremony, the fathers have Kajal kidnapped. Raja saves her from being raped and comforts her. Meanwhile, without their knowledge, photos are taken of them. The fathers then show the photos of Raja comforting Kajal at the party. Taken out of context, the photos make it look like Raja and Kajal are being intimate with each other. Raja and Kajal are willing to prove their innocence, but the fathers keep them away. To make matters worse, Kajal's uncle ([[Mohan Joshi]]) falsely testifies to the fabricated illicit affair between the two. In fact, Kajal's uncle was paid to lie to Ajay and Madhu.\n\nAjay and Madhu break up with Kajal and Raja, and the fathers' plan to create a rift between Ajay and Raja, once the best of friends, succeeds. The situation worsens further when Ajay and Madhu think that Kajal is pregnant with Raja's child. They tell Raja and Kajal that they are getting married, which is what their fathers wanted all along. After hearing this, Kajal attempts to kill herself, but Raja stops her. Raja attacks Ajay and Madhu while they are in a car mobile. Raja pretends to show that he is about to rape Madhu, but Ajay saves and comforts her. The police beat Raja brutally and Kajal pleads the fathers to release him. The fathers agree, but on the condition that Kajal and Raja leave the country for good and that they would be killed if they ever did return. Kajal agrees and Raja is set free.\n\nAjay and Madhu's wedding is about to start when Ajay's uncle ([[Johny Lever]]) shows them pictures of Ajay comforting Madhu after Ajay seemingly had saved Madhu from Rajas supposed attack, taken out of context. This proves that Raja had attacked them to recreate the situation he and Kajal had been in, which in turn proved that Raja and Kajal are innocent and that the fathers were behind the initial attack on Kajal. Further proving Raja and Kajal's innocence, Kajal's uncle also confesses that he lied out of bribery. Angry and heartbroken, Ajay almost chokes his father to death but his conscience stops him. He then tries to kill himself but Madhu stops him. Ajay and Madhu rush to the shipyard and succeed to stop Raja and Kajal from leaving the country on the ship. They ask for forgiveness and the lovers get back together. The fathers arrive, having realized their grave mistake, and also ask for forgiveness. The lovers forgive them and they sing and dance to a song.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Raja\n* [[Ajay Devgan]] as Ajay Rai\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Madhu\n* [[Kajol]] as Kajal\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Lambodar Upadhyay (Ajay's uncle)\n* [[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]] as Ranjit Rai (Ajay's father)\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Harbans Lal Saxena (Madhu's father)\n* [[Mohan Joshi]] as Madan Jindal (Kajal's uncle)\n* [[Razzak Khan]] as Nawaab naadin Dhinna Changezi\n* [[Shwetha Menon]] (dancer in song \"Humko Tumse Pyar Hai\")\n* [[Ghanashyam Nayak]] as ACP Ghanshyam Gulati (Harbans Lal's partner)\n* [[Achyut Potdar]] as Barrister Gokhale\n* [[Deepak Shirke]] as Damliya\n* [[Tiku Talsania]] as Bank manager Gaitonde\n* [[Deven Verma]] as Behram\n* [[Anant Mahadevan]] as Brijesh\n* [[Veeru Krishnan]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\nDirector [[Indra Kumar]] had initially planned to make ''Ishq'' in 1991 with [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] as two of the four leads, but due to their personal problems at the time, they opted out of the film. Later, [[Boney Kapoor]] asked Kumar to make the film with [[Sanjay Kapoor]] and [[Vivek Mushran]] playing the roles of Ajay and Raja, respectively. However, Kumar had no happiness to cast the two, and he then made the film ''[[Raja (1995 film)|Raja]]'' with Sanjay Kapoor, which released in 1995. He again came with the idea of making ''Ishq'' in 1996 and selected [[Ajay Devgn]], Aamir Khan, [[Kajol]] and [[Juhi Chawla]] to play the leads. \n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Karisma Kapoor]] and [[Madhuri Dixit]] were offered the roles of Kajol and Juhi Chawla, respectively, but the former declined to not work opposite Devgn and the latter had date issues. Along with this, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] was signed to play the role of a man who after completing an intermission tries to unite the four lovers, but due to some problems with Kumar, he left the film, and Kumar later removed that character from the film. ''Ishq'' was Kumar's first movie to not star Madhuri Dixit as a female lead and second movie with Aamir Khan after 1990's ''[[Dil (1990 film)|Dil]]''. The film also marked the first collaboration between Kumar and Devgn.\n\n===Filming===\n\nDuring the shooting of the film, Aamir Khan throwed a prank on Juhi Chawla, after which she got irritated.\n\n==Box office==\nThe movie was a blockbuster and earned \u20b953.2 crores against a budget of \u20b910 crores.<ref name=\"boi\">{{cite web |title=Ishq \u2013 Movie |url=https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=2627 |website=[[Box Office India]] |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe music was composed by Anu Malik.

There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore. Mainly, those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic.

In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for \"rightness\" or \"goodness\". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts. This term is related to psychology. There are other types of development such as social development, physical development and cognitive development.\n\nNotions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.\n\nThe interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.\n\n==Historical background and foundational theories ==\n[[File:Confuscious Down Under (5022724040).jpg|thumb|\n[[Confucius]]\n]]\n\n'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.<ref>Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.</ref> According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).\n\n'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development.<ref name=\":3\">Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.</ref> In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.\n\n'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.<ref>Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.</ref> To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.\n[[File:Jean Piaget in Ann Arbor.png|thumb|212x212px|[[Jean Piaget]].]]\n\n'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] proposed a highly influential [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|theory of moral development]] which was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].<ref>Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1981. Print.</ref>\n\n'''Social Domain Theory:''' [[Elliot Turiel]]  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan.<ref>Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.</ref> Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.\n\nFor the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.<ref name=\":0\">Killen, M., & Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development\n\n==Cognition and intentionality==\n\nA hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target's intentions towards another.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2\u20133|pages=337\u2013359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}</ref>  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}</ref> Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman & Lui, 2004<ref>Wellman, H. M., & Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.</ref>). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.<ref>Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.</ref> Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one's intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.<ref>Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., & Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.</ref> In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.<ref>Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., & Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.</ref> Beyond the ability to identify one's intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, & Lau, 1996<ref>Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., & Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.</ref>), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw & Wainryb, 2006).<ref>Shaw, L. A., & Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.</ref> In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.\n\n==Emotions==\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social intuitionism|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\n\nMoral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.\n\nResearch on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several \"moral emotions\" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).<ref>Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665\u2013697.</ref> These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual's set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska & Thompson, 1997).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587\u20131618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|pmid=17083659|issn=1467-6494}}</ref> The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345\u2013372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|pmid=16953797|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}</ref> The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as \"an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event\" (Fergusen & Stegge, 1998).<ref>Ferguson T. J. & Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19\u201374. San Diego: Academic.</ref> Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered \"self-conscious\" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).\n\nThe relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, & Sadovsky, 2006).<ref>Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., & Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen & J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;<ref>Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282\u2013316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler & Robinson, 1995).\n\nWhile emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;<ref>Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}</ref> Haidt, 2001<ref>Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. ''Psychological Review'', 108, 814-834.</ref>). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel & Killen, 2010).<ref>Turiel, E., & Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio & E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.</ref> Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,<ref>Arsenio, W.

(1996). Typical and behaviourally disruptive children's understanding of the emotional consequences of socio-moral events. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 14, 173-186</ref>). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise & Arsenio, 2000).<ref>Lemerise, E., & Arsenio, W. (2000). An integrated model of emotion processes and cognition in social information processing.

In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).<ref name=Smetana1984>Smetana, J.

''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.</ref> Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.<ref name=Smetana1984/>\n\nResearch from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska & Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.<ref>Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.</ref> These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010<ref>Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., & Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332</ref>). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930\u20131961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W.

Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988);<ref>Aboud, F. E. (1988). Children and prejudice.

While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).<ref>McKown, C. (2004). Age and ethnic variation in children's thinking about the nature of racism. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 25, 597-617. {{doi|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.08.001}}</ref>\n\nIn developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, & Sinno, 2006;<ref>Killen, M., Margie, N. G., & Sinno, S. (2006). Morality in the context of intergroup relationships. In M. Killen & J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 155-183). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (e.g. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently deliberately because of the group they are associated with.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).<ref>Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.</ref> Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).<ref>Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.</ref> Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen & Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity.\n\nOne explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.<ref>Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., & Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.</ref>\n\nCulture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.<ref name=\"Social and personality development\">{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}</ref> Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.<ref name=\"Social and personality development\" /> Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual's behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.<ref name=\"Social and personality development\"/>\n\n=== Moral relativism ===\n[[Moral relativism]], also called \u201ccultural relativism,\u201d suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one's own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.<ref>Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., & Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan & S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</ref> The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.<ref>Turiel, E. & Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.</ref> Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).<ref>Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen & J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting among others.<ref>Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen & J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.</ref>  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.<ref>Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.</ref><ref>Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.</ref>  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.<ref>Nucci, L. P., & Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.</ref> Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions.\n\n===In indigenous American communities===\n\nIn [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations.<ref name=\"Howard 1999 45\u201353\">{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|issue=1|pages=45\u201353|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}</ref> [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.\n\n[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}</ref> The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.\n\nSpecific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance <ref name=\"Howard 1999 45\u201353\"/> while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .<ref>{{cite web|title=Native American Indian Legends and Folklore |url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}</ref> In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.\n\n===Social exclusion===\n\nIntergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors: prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, & Stangor, 2002).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i\u2013129|jstor=3181568}}</ref>\n\nFindings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,<ref>Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84</ref> Killen and Stangor, 2001<ref>Killen, M., & Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186</ref>). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, & Watanabe, 2002;<ref>Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., & Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802</ref> Park, Killen, Crystal, & Watanabe, 2003<ref>Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., & Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565</ref>). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen & Stangor, 2001)\n\n===Allocation of resources===\n\n[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71\u20134|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}</ref> When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}</ref> The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a focus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include \u201cany combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}</ref> The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72\u201373|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}</ref>\n\nThe healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts.

In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for \"rightness\" or \"goodness\". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts. This term is related to psychology. There are other types of development such as social development, physical development and cognitive development.\n\nNotions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.\n\nThe interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.\n\n==Historical background and foundational theories ==\n[[File:Confuscious Down Under (5022724040).jpg|thumb|\n[[Confucius]]\n]]\n\n'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.<ref>Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.</ref> According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).\n\n'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development.<ref name=\":3\">Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.</ref> In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.\n\n'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.<ref>Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.</ref> To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.\n[[File:Jean Piaget in Ann Arbor.png|thumb|212x212px|[[Jean Piaget]].]]\n\n'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] proposed a highly influential [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|theory of moral development]] which was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].<ref>Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1981. Print.</ref>\n\n'''Social Domain Theory:''' [[Elliot Turiel]]  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan.<ref>Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.</ref> Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.\n\nFor the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.<ref name=\":0\">Killen, M., & Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development\n\n==Cognition and intentionality==\n\nA hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target's intentions towards another.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2\u20133|pages=337\u2013359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}</ref>  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}</ref> Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman & Lui, 2004<ref>Wellman, H. M., & Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.</ref>). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.<ref>Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.</ref> Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one's intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.<ref>Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., & Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.</ref> In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.<ref>Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., & Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.</ref> Beyond the ability to identify one's intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, & Lau, 1996<ref>Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., & Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.</ref>), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw & Wainryb, 2006).<ref>Shaw, L. A., & Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.</ref> In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.\n\n==Emotions==\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social intuitionism|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\n\nMoral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.\n\nResearch on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several \"moral emotions\" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).<ref>Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665\u2013697.</ref> These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual's set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska & Thompson, 1997).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587\u20131618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|pmid=17083659|issn=1467-6494}}</ref> The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345\u2013372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|pmid=16953797|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}</ref> The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as \"an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event\" (Fergusen & Stegge, 1998).<ref>Ferguson T. J. & Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19\u201374. San Diego: Academic.</ref> Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered \"self-conscious\" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).\n\nThe relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, & Sadovsky, 2006).<ref>Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., & Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen & J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;<ref>Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282\u2013316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler & Robinson, 1995).\n\nWhile emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;<ref>Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}</ref> Haidt, 2001<ref>Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. ''Psychological Review'', 108, 814-834.</ref>). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel & Killen, 2010).<ref>Turiel, E., & Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio & E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.</ref> Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,<ref>Arsenio, W. F. (1988). Children's conceptions of the situational affective consequences of sociomoral events. ''Child Development'', 59, 1611-1622.</ref> Arsenio & Fleiss, 1996<ref>Arsenio, W. F., & Fleiss, K. (1996). Typical and behaviourally disruptive children's understanding of the emotional consequences of socio-moral events. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 14, 173-186</ref>). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise & Arsenio, 2000).<ref>Lemerise, E., & Arsenio, W. (2000). An integrated model of emotion processes and cognition in social information processing. ''Child Development'', 71, 107-118.</ref> In addition, Malti, Gummerum, Keller, & Buchmann, (2009) found individual differences in how children attribute emotions to victims and victimizers.<ref>Malti, T., Gummerum, M., Keller, M., & Buchmann, M. (2009). Children's moral motivation, sympathy, and prosocial behavior. ''Child Development'', 80, 442-460.</ref>\n\n==Role of interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural influences==\nChildren's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behavior<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/early-childhood-moral-development/|title=Early Childhood Moral Development|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2018-03-25}}</ref> Researchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994;<ref>Grusec, J.

In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).<ref name=Smetana1984>Smetana, J.

''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.</ref> Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.<ref name=Smetana1984/>\n\nResearch from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska & Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.<ref>Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.</ref> These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010<ref>Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., & Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332</ref>). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930\u20131961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W.

While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).<ref>McKown, C.

These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (e.g. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently deliberately because of the group they are associated with.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).<ref>Allport, G.

Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.</ref> Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).<ref>Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.</ref> Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen & Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity.\n\nOne explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.<ref>Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., & Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.</ref>\n\nCulture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.<ref name=\"Social and personality development\">{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}</ref> Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.<ref name=\"Social and personality development\" /> Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual's behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.<ref name=\"Social and personality development\"/>\n\n=== Moral relativism ===\n[[Moral relativism]], also called \u201ccultural relativism,\u201d suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one's own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.<ref>Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., & Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan & S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</ref> The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.<ref>Turiel, E. & Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.</ref> Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).<ref>Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen & J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting among others.<ref>Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen & J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.</ref>  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.<ref>Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.</ref><ref>Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.</ref>  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.<ref>Nucci, L. P., & Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.</ref> Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions.\n\n===In indigenous American communities===\n\nIn [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations.<ref name=\"Howard 1999 45\u201353\">{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|issue=1|pages=45\u201353|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}</ref> [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.\n\n[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}</ref> The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.\n\nSpecific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance <ref name=\"Howard 1999 45\u201353\"/> while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .<ref>{{cite web|title=Native American Indian Legends and Folklore |url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}</ref> In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.\n\n===Social exclusion===\n\nIntergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors: prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, & Stangor, 2002).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i\u2013129|jstor=3181568}}</ref>\n\nFindings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,<ref>Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84</ref> Killen and Stangor, 2001<ref>Killen, M., & Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186</ref>). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, & Watanabe, 2002;<ref>Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., & Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802</ref> Park, Killen, Crystal, & Watanabe, 2003<ref>Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., & Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565</ref>). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen & Stangor, 2001)\n\n===Allocation of resources===\n\n[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71\u20134|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}</ref> When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}</ref> The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a focus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include \u201cany combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}</ref> The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72\u201373|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}</ref>\n\nThe healthcare system has many examples where morality and resource allocation has ongoing conflicts.

India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at [[Lord's]], becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen [[Sunil Gavaskar|Gavaskar]], [[Gundappa Viswanath|Viswanath]], [[Kapil Dev]], and the [[Indian spin quartet]].\n\nTraditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. It has won the [[India at the Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]] twice \u2013 in [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] under the captaincy of [[Kapil Dev]] and in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] under the captaincy of [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]].

England was the visiting team that played 2 Tests in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now Kolkata). The visitors won the series 2\u20130. The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and '40s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the [[Second World War]]. The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against [[Sir Donald Bradman]]'s [[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]] (a name given to the [[Australia national cricket team]] of that time).

However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5\u20130 whitewash ever inflicted by England. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961\u201362 and also won a home series against New Zealand. They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967\u201368.\n\nThe key to India's [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] in the 1970s were the [[Indian spin quartet]] \u2013 [[Bishen Bedi]], [[E.A.S. Prasanna]], [[BS Chandrasekhar]] and [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]]. This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and [[Gundappa Viswanath]]. Indian [[cricket pitch|pitches]] have had the tendency to support [[spin bowling|spin]] and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of [[Ajit Wadekar]]. Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while [[Dilip Sardesai]]'s 112 played a big part in their one Test win.\n\n===One-day cricket and ICC Cricket World Cup success (1970-1985)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1970\u201371 to 1985}}\n[[File:Indian Cricket Team Test Results.svg|thumb|A graph showing India's Test match results against all Test match teams from 1932 to September 2006.]]\nThe advent of [[One Day International]] (ODI) cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|title=Team India on the brink of ODI record at Vizag, remain torchbearers of 50-over format|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024113206/https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.\n\nIn contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and was particularly strong at home, where their combination of stylish batsmen and beguiling spinners were at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976, when they chased 403 to win, thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain [[Clive Lloyd]] dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack instead. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without any individual batsman scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by [[Mohinder Amarnath]]. This innings was only the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and all-rounders [[Kapil Dev]] and [[Ravi Shastri]]. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and the two-time defending champions West Indies in the final at Lords, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the [[Asia Cup]] and in 1985, won the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.\n\n===Late 20th century (1985-2000)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1985\u201386 to 2000}}\n[[File:Kumble edited.jpg|thumb|With 619 wickets, [[Anil Kumble]] is the world's third highest wicket-taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |title=Cricinfo- Anil Kumble |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211161513/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |archive-date=11 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe addition of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, [[Javagal Srinath]], India's fastest bowler since [[Amar Singh (cricketer)|Amar Singh]] made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]] while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as [[Sourav Ganguly]] and [[Rahul Dravid]], later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best-ranked team in the world.\n\nAfter failing to reach the semifinals at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3\u20130 on a tour of Australia and then 2\u20130 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman [[Ajay Jadeja]] were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as \"the Indian cricket's worst hour\". However, the new core \u2013 Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly \u2013 swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | work=BBC News | title=India cricket: Middle-order retirements are end of era | date=23 August 2012 | access-date=22 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018224629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | archive-date=18 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Turn of the millennium (2000-present)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 2000\u201301}}\nSince 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and guidance of [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]], India's first ever foreign [[List of India national cricket coaches|coach]]. India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. [[Australian national cricket captains|Australian captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] labelled India as the \"Final Frontier\" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|title = Steve Waugh Column|work = Steve Waugh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017222838/http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|archive-date = 17 October 2007|url-status = live}}</ref> Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka and then went to the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] in South Africa where they reached the final, only to be beaten by Australia. The 2003\u201304 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1\u20131 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.\n\n[[File:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|The Indian cricket team in action at Wankhede Stadium.]]\nAt the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1\u20131. [[Greg Chappell]] took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, [[Suresh Raina]], and the coming of age of players like [[Irfan Pathan]] and [[Yuvraj Singh]]. A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and [[Virender Sehwag]] were selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 \"[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]\" against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = TWI gets production rights for India-Pakistan series|work = The Hindu \u2013 Sport|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4\u20131 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1\u20130 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2\u20131. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = India can find right balance before World Cup|work = Jamie Alter|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, India played and won its first ever [[Twenty20]] international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like [[Robin Uthappa]] saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round.\n\n====Success under Dhoni====\nAfter [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|winning the Test series against England]] in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team, following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever [[Twenty20 World Cup]] held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007\u201308, they toured Australia where India lost the highly controversial home [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007-08|Test series]] 2\u20131 but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.\n\nIn April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2\u20130 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2\u20130 in the home test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1\u20131.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html The series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308152608/http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html |date=8 March 2011 }} cricinfo</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-\n|+'''India's results in International Matches'''\n|-\n!

The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and [[VVS Laxman]] from Test cricket in 2012. Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match. With Ganguly retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up India had for over a decade. In 2012, India continued to face a tough transition period as they were beaten 2\u20131 in a home Test series by England. This was the first time India were beaten by England at home since [[English cricket team in India and Sri Lanka in 1984\u201385|1984\u201385]]. This was followed by a 2\u20131 loss in the ODI series against Pakistan, India's arch-rivals, at home. India were then knocked out in the second round of the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]]. India also failed to qualify for the [[2012 Asia Cup]] final which closed out a disappointing year for India. However, 2013 saw a resurgence in Indian cricket.\n\n====Worldwide limited-overs success====\nIn early 2013, India returned the favour to Australia and whitewashed them 4\u20130 at home in a Test series. India then beat the Aussies 3\u20132 in the 7-match ODI series and won the one-off T20I. However, India lost heavily against New Zealand and South Africa away from home and led to heavy criticism of Indian cricketers for not being able to perform overseas. India defeated England in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]] final and [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] became the first captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely- [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC World Twenty20]] and ICC Champions Trophy. This was followed by a victory in the [[West Indies Triangular Series in 2013]] consisting of India, West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2014, India toured Bangladesh and England. Although they beat the former 2\u20130 in 3 One Day Internationals, Team India were beaten 3\u20131 in 5 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] by England. This series included a famous win for the Indian team in the first match of the series at Lord's. The Test series was followed by a 3\u20131 win for the Indians in a 5-match ODI series and a loss in a one-off T20, both against England.\n\nIndia failed to reach the final of the [[Asia Cup]] yet again in 2014. In the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]] hosted in Bangladesh, India narrowly missed out on another ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final. This tournament saw the rise of [[Virat Kohli]] as one of the best limited overs batsmen in world cricket, as he was adjudged the man of the series. India soon comprehensively beat Sri Lanka and West Indies in ODI series to cement their position at the top of the ODI rankings. India toured Australia towards the end of 2014 for a 4-match Test series, which is remembered for MS Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket after the end of the second Test. Virat Kohli was appointed as the captain of Team India in Test matches but he was unable to turn the series around and India lost 2\u20130. Kohli's first series win as captain came away from home in a 3-match Test series vs Sri Lanka, which signalled the beginning of an unbeaten Test series run for India.\n\n2015 saw the beginning of India's dominance at home in Test matches under new captain Virat Kohli when they comprehensively beat South Africa. This series was the beginning of an unbeaten streak of 19 Test matches for India which was brought to an end by Australia in early 2017. This series also saw the emergence of [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] and [[Ravindra Jadeja]] as two of the best spinners and all-rounders. They spun webs around touring batsmen, much like the spinning quartet of the 1970s. This was followed by limited overs victories over Australia and Sri Lanka away from home. India was knocked out of the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]] in the semi-final stage, to eventual winners Australia. India began 2016 by winning the [[2016 Asia Cup]], remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament, beating Pakistan along the way. India were favourites to win the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20]] which was being held at home, but they lost in the semi-final to eventual champions West Indies. Virat Kohli was again named the man of the series.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Grand Home Season\" began for India, including series at home against New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia. India whitewashed New Zealand to regain the number one ranking in Test cricket after almost 10 years. Before the series against England in November 2016, MS Dhoni resigned as captain of India in limited overs, thus handing the captaincy to Virat Kohli across all formats. India beat England across all three formats, with a notable 4\u20130 win in the Test series. This was followed by Test series wins against Bangladesh and Australia,  which meant India reclaimed the [[Border Gavaskar Trophy]].

In addition to their whites, Indian fielders wear a dark blue cap or a white wide-brimmed sun hat, with the BCCI logo in the center. Helmets are also dark blue. Some players sport the Indian flag on their helmet.\n\nThe branding is minimal for whites; the BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the team sponsor's (currently OPPO) logo is present on the right chest. The kit manufacturer's (Nike) logo would be printed on the sleeve of the players' leading arms.\n\n=== Limited overs ===\nSince colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour. The blue colour of the uniform has earned them the nickname of 'Men in Blue' for the Indian cricket team. The secondary colour has changed over the years while yellow and orange have been dominant. With the inception of the [[World Series Cup]] in 1979, each team had to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms and the Indian team elected to wear light blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. The team has worn different shades of blue since then. For the 1992 World Cup ([[1992 Cricket World Cup|Benson & Hedges World Cup]]), the team's colours were changed to navy-blue by [[ISC (sportswear)|ISC]], the common kit manufacturer for the tournament. A light shade of blue with yellow as secondary colour and a strip with 10 different colours (representing different nations) was adapted on the uniform for the 1996 World Cup ([[1996 Cricket World Cup|Wills World Cup]]) while an even lighter shade of blue and a dominant yellow was used by [[ASICS]], the common kit manufacturer for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. The ICC no longer appoints a common kit manufacturer for its tournaments.\n\nDifferent designs were adopted on the playing jerseys over the years and the most predominant one has been 'India' text written in yellow over a diagonal splash of the tricolour. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired the kit manufacturing rights for the team in 2005 and designed new jerseys for the 2007 World Cup with the lightest shade of blue used by the team till date and golden yellow as the secondary colour. A new tricolour accent was implemented on the right side of the jersey. The colour was changed to a darker feroza blue in 2009 with orange replacing yellow as the secondary colour.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Team India's new jersey unveiled | date=18 February 2009 | access-date=18 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220120150/http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | archive-date=20 February 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA New Jersey was unveiled by Nike with a bolder ultramarine blue shade<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|title=Team India dazzles in 'ultramarine' blue new jersey|date=20 October 2010|work=The Times of India|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044102/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and a new tricolour accent placed on both sides of the jersey in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|title=Team India gets new Nike ODI kit|work=Cricbuzz|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110012/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A reddish-orange shade was used as the secondary colour on this uniform.

The tricolour accent made a return to the uniform as a single thin strip on either sides of upper chest.\n\nIn addition to the blue uniforms, the caps worn by the players are similar to the design of uniforms. The wide-brimmed sun hats are usually white while the helmets used by the players are of darker blue.\n\nSimilar to the first-class kits, BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the logo of the kit manufacturer (Nike) sits on the right chest. The official team sponsor's logo (currently BYJU'S) is present on the central part of the jersey usually above 'INDIA' text as well as the sleeve of the players' leading arms. For T20 kits, in addition to these, the sponsor's logo is also present on the back, below the players' numbers.

Most grounds are under the administration of various state cricket boards as opposed to being under the control of the BCCI. The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team. This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877. The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in [[Bombay]] in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted. The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at [[Eden Gardens]] and [[Chepauk]]. The [[Feroz Shah Kotla Ground]] in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one [[List of Test cricket grounds|official Test match]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of world-class cricket stadiums in India, with multiple Test venues in [[Indore]], [[Chandigarh]] [[Mohali]], [[Chennai]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Rajkot]], [[Ranchi]], [[Pune]], [[Dharamshala]] and [[Nagpur]].\n\nEden Gardens in Kolkata has hosted the most Tests, and also has the second-largest [[seating capacity]] of any cricket stadium in the world, being capable of holding more than 66,000 spectators. Founded in 1864, it is one of the most historical stadiums in India, having hosted numerous historical and controversial matches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Eden Gardens |work = Cricinfo |accessdate = 21 September 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041632/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |archive-date = 6 October 2006 |url-status = live }}</ref> Other major stadiums in India include the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, which was established in 1883 and hosted memorable matches including Anil Kumble's ten wickets in an innings haul against Pakistan.

[[Wankhede Stadium]], established in 1974, has a capacity to hold 33,000 spectators and is currently the most popular venue in the city. It has hosted 24 Test matches. It was the unofficial successor of the Brabourne Stadium, which is also located in Mumbai. Mumbai is often considered the cricketing capital of India because of its fans and the talent it produces (see [[Mumbai cricket team]]) and thus the stadium regularly hosts major Test matches.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Wankhede Stadium|work = Cricinfo|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104024543/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|archive-date = 4 November 2006|url-status = live}}</ref> The [[M.

India's first captain was [[CK Nayudu]], who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933\u201334. [[Lala Amarnath]], India's fourth captain, led the team in its first Test match after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]]. He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952\u201353. From 1952 until 1961\u201362, India had a number of captains such as [[Vijay Hazare]], [[Polly Umrigar]] and [[Nari Contractor]].\n\nThe Nawab of Pataudi, [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi]], was the team's captain for 36 Test matches from 1961\u201362 to 1969\u201370, returning for another four matches against West Indies in 1974\u201375. In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia. However, in 1967\u201368, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3\u20131. In 1970\u201371, [[Ajit Wadekar]] took over the captaincy from Pataudi. Under Wadekar's captaincy, India registered its first Test series win in the West Indies and England. India played its first ODI in 1974, also under his captaincy. India won its first ODI under the captaincy of [[Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan]] in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup]], against [[East African cricket team|East Africa]]. Between 1975\u201376 and 1978\u201379, [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] captained the team in 22 Tests and 4 ODIs, winning 6 Tests and one ODI.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1983 Cricket WC.jpg|thumb|Kapil Dev led the Indian team to victory at the 1983 World Cup.]] -->\n[[Sunil Gavaskar]] took over as Test and ODI captain in 1978\u201379, leading India in 47 Test matches and 37 ODIs, winning 9 Tests and 14 ODIs. He was succeeded by [[Kapil Dev]] in the 1980s, who captained for 34 Test matches, including 4 victories. Kapil Dev led India to victory in 39 of his 74 ODIs in charge, including the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]]. Kapil Dev also captained India's 2\u20130 Test series victory in England in 1986. Between 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390, India had three captains in [[Dilip Vengsarkar]], Ravi Shastri and [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]. Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early-1989 and a stand-off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).\n\nIndia has had six regular Test captains since [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] took charge in 1989. Azharuddin led the team in 47 Test matches from 1989\u201390 to 1998\u201399, winning 14, and in 174 ODIs, winning 90. He was followed by Sachin Tendulkar, who captained the team in 25 Test matches and 73 ODIs in the late 1990s; Tendulkar was relatively unsuccessful<ref>{{cite news|title=Tendulkar on his captains: Ganguly was aggressive, Rahul methodical, Dhoni instinctive|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|accessdate=1 July 2015|work=[[Firstpost]]|date=7 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715070716/http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|title=Replacing Sachin with Azhar as captain in 1997: When selectors spun the ball|accessdate=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109181442/http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=live|date=6 November 2014}}</ref> as a captain, winning only 4 Test matches and 23 ODIs. He was replaced as ODI captain by [[Ajay Jadeja]] and then by [[Sourav Ganguly]].\n\nGanguly became the regular captain of the team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000. He remained captain until 2005\u201306 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49 Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. India lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia. [[Rahul Dravid]] took over as Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.\n\nIn September 2007, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] was named as the new captain of the ODI and [[T20I]] teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural World Twenty20]] title. [[Anil Kumble]] was appointed Test captain in November 2007, but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded him as the Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team held the number one position in the [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]] for 21 months (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine straight wins).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090213041951/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|url-status=dead|title=The Canadian Press: Sri Lanka denies India 5-0 rout by winning final ...|date=13 February 2009|archivedate=13 February 2009}}</ref> Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, with [[Virat Kohli]] being named as the new Test captain. Dhoni resigned as captain of the ODI and T20 teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.\n\nUnder Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3\u20130 series win over New Zealand and ending with a 2\u20131 series win over Australia. India has an unbeaten streak of winning 9 consecutive Test series as of Dec 2017, starting with a 2\u20131 series win over Sri Lanka. India also became only the third team after Australia and South Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli is India's most successful test captain, having won more than 61% of Test matches (at least 2 games).\n\n==Squad==\nThis lists all the players who have played for India in the past 12 months and the formats in which they have played.

He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs. The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by [[Virender Sehwag]] in Chennai. It is the second [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century in Test cricket]] by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan. The team's highest ever score was a 759/7 against England at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in 2016, while its lowest was 42 against England in 1974. In ODIs, the team's highest score is 418/5 against West Indies at Indore in 2011\u201312. India score 413\u20135 in a match against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] which is the highest score ever in Cricket World Cup history. In the same match, India set a world record of the highest winning margin in an ODI match of 257 runs.\n\nIndia has also had some very strong bowling figures, with spin bowler Anil Kumble being a member of the elite group of 3 bowlers who have taken 600 Test wickets. In 1999, Anil Kumble emulated [[Jim Laker]] to become the second bowler to take all ten wickets in a Test match innings when he took 10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[Delhi]].\n\nMany of the Indian cricket team's records are also [[Test cricket records|world records]], for example Sachin Tendulkar's century tally (in Tests and ODIs) and run tally (also in both Tests and ODIs). Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the world record score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. The Indian cricket team also holds the record sequence of 17 successful run-chases in ODIs,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-www1.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/248029.html|title = Dravid rues faulty execution|work=Cricinfo Staff| accessdate =21 September 2006|date = 21 May 2006}}</ref> which ended in a dramatic match against the West Indies in May 2006, which India lost by just 1 run when Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Dwayne Bravo's full toss.\n\nSachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to score 200 runs (he was unbeaten on 200 from 147 deliveries including 25x4 and 3x6) in a single ODI innings, on 24 February 2010 against South Africa in [[Gwalior]]. On 8 December 2011, this achievement was eclipsed by compatriot Virender Sehwag, who scored 219 runs from 149 deliveries (25x4 | 7x6) versus [[West Indies]] in [[Indore]]. On 13 November 2014 the record was broken by another Indian opening batsmen, [[Rohit Sharma]], who scored 264 runs from 173 deliveries (33x4 | 9x6) against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in Kolkata. In 2013, MS Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Virat Kohli became the first cricketer to win back-to-back man of the series awards in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]]. In 2017, Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer in history to reach 250 wickets. He and Ravindra Jadeja are considered to be the best bowlers in Test cricket and occupy the top two spots in the rankings for Test bowlers {{as of|2017|May|lc=y}}. Virat Kohli became the first captain in history to score double tons in three consecutive series, against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh in 2017.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|Indian cricket team records}}\n{{further|India national cricket team record by opponent}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Tests===\n{{main|List of India Test cricket records}}\n'''Test record versus other nations'''\n{{India Test cricket records by opponent}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n'''Most Test runs for India'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Cricket Records {{!}} Records {{!}} India {{!}} Test matches {{!}} Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1;id=6;type=team|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913072807/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1%3Bid%3D6%3Btype%3Dteam|archive-date=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket. This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI's]] financial success.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|title = 10,000 Visas for Pak Cricket Fans|work = The Tribune, Chandigarh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903055335/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|archive-date = 3 September 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold [[Cricket in India|cricket]] very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player [[effigy|effigies]] being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|title = Ganguly's Debt of Gratitude|work = BBC News|accessdate = 21 September 2006|date = 21 March 2003|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090113015842/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|archive-date = 13 January 2009|url-status = live}}</ref> In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at [[Brabourne Stadium]] in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks .<ref name=\"Riots\">{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|title = I predict a riot|work = Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson|accessdate = 22 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208133819/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|archive-date = 8 February 2007|url-status = live|date = 11 April 2006}}</ref> A similar event occurred during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], where India were losing the semi-final to Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens.

Their next appearance in the Test and ODI circuit was against Australia in 1984, in which the Test series was tied but the [[Women's one-day international cricket|ODI series]] was lost in a whitewash.\n\nThe Indian women's cricket team has since picked up their form, reaching the finals in the World Cup, but then losing to [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australia]]. The Women's Asia Cup of 2005\u201306 was won by India, who beat Sri Lanka in the final. They also beat the West Indies in the 2004\u201305 season, winning the 5 ODI series 5\u20130.

India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at [[Lord's]], becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen [[Sunil Gavaskar|Gavaskar]], [[Gundappa Viswanath|Viswanath]], [[Kapil Dev]], and the [[Indian spin quartet]].\n\nTraditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. It has won the [[India at the Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]] twice \u2013 in [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] under the captaincy of [[Kapil Dev]] and in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] under the captaincy of [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]].

It also won the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]], under the captaincy of [[MS Dhoni]]. It was also the joint champions of [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]], along with [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].\n\nThe Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably [[India\u2013Pakistan cricket rivalry|with Pakistan]], the political arch-rival of India.

On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5\u20130 whitewash ever inflicted by England. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961\u201362 and also won a home series against New Zealand.

In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967\u201368.\n\nThe key to India's [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] in the 1970s were the [[Indian spin quartet]] \u2013 [[Bishen Bedi]], [[E.A.S.

Indian [[cricket pitch|pitches]] have had the tendency to support [[spin bowling|spin]] and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of [[Ajit Wadekar]].

However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|title=Team India on the brink of ODI record at Vizag, remain torchbearers of 50-over format|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024113206/https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.\n\nIn contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and was particularly strong at home, where their combination of stylish batsmen and beguiling spinners were at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976, when they chased 403 to win, thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain [[Clive Lloyd]] dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack instead. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without any individual batsman scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by [[Mohinder Amarnath]]. This innings was only the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and all-rounders [[Kapil Dev]] and [[Ravi Shastri]]. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and the two-time defending champions West Indies in the final at Lords, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the [[Asia Cup]] and in 1985, won the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.\n\n===Late 20th century (1985-2000)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1985\u201386 to 2000}}\n[[File:Kumble edited.jpg|thumb|With 619 wickets, [[Anil Kumble]] is the world's third highest wicket-taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |title=Cricinfo- Anil Kumble |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211161513/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |archive-date=11 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe addition of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, [[Javagal Srinath]], India's fastest bowler since [[Amar Singh (cricketer)|Amar Singh]] made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]] while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as [[Sourav Ganguly]] and [[Rahul Dravid]], later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best-ranked team in the world.\n\nAfter failing to reach the semifinals at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3\u20130 on a tour of Australia and then 2\u20130 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman [[Ajay Jadeja]] were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as \"the Indian cricket's worst hour\". However, the new core \u2013 Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly \u2013 swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | work=BBC News | title=India cricket: Middle-order retirements are end of era | date=23 August 2012 | access-date=22 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018224629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | archive-date=18 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Turn of the millennium (2000-present)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 2000\u201301}}\nSince 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and guidance of [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]], India's first ever foreign [[List of India national cricket coaches|coach]]. India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. [[Australian national cricket captains|Australian captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] labelled India as the \"Final Frontier\" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|title = Steve Waugh Column|work = Steve Waugh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017222838/http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|archive-date = 17 October 2007|url-status = live}}</ref> Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka and then went to the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] in South Africa where they reached the final, only to be beaten by Australia. The 2003\u201304 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1\u20131 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.\n\n[[File:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|The Indian cricket team in action at Wankhede Stadium.]]\nAt the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1\u20131. [[Greg Chappell]] took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, [[Suresh Raina]], and the coming of age of players like [[Irfan Pathan]] and [[Yuvraj Singh]]. A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and [[Virender Sehwag]] were selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 \"[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]\" against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = TWI gets production rights for India-Pakistan series|work = The Hindu \u2013 Sport|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4\u20131 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1\u20130 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2\u20131. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = India can find right balance before World Cup|work = Jamie Alter|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, India played and won its first ever [[Twenty20]] international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like [[Robin Uthappa]] saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round.\n\n====Success under Dhoni====\nAfter [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|winning the Test series against England]] in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team, following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever [[Twenty20 World Cup]] held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007\u201308, they toured Australia where India lost the highly controversial home [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007-08|Test series]] 2\u20131 but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.\n\nIn April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2\u20130 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2\u20130 in the home test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1\u20131.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html The series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308152608/http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html |date=8 March 2011 }} cricinfo</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-\n|+'''India's results in International Matches'''\n|-\n!

The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and [[VVS Laxman]] from Test cricket in 2012. Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match. With Ganguly retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up India had for over a decade. In 2012, India continued to face a tough transition period as they were beaten 2\u20131 in a home Test series by England. This was the first time India were beaten by England at home since [[English cricket team in India and Sri Lanka in 1984\u201385|1984\u201385]]. This was followed by a 2\u20131 loss in the ODI series against Pakistan, India's arch-rivals, at home. India were then knocked out in the second round of the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]]. India also failed to qualify for the [[2012 Asia Cup]] final which closed out a disappointing year for India. However, 2013 saw a resurgence in Indian cricket.\n\n====Worldwide limited-overs success====\nIn early 2013, India returned the favour to Australia and whitewashed them 4\u20130 at home in a Test series. India then beat the Aussies 3\u20132 in the 7-match ODI series and won the one-off T20I. However, India lost heavily against New Zealand and South Africa away from home and led to heavy criticism of Indian cricketers for not being able to perform overseas. India defeated England in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]] final and [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] became the first captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely- [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC World Twenty20]] and ICC Champions Trophy. This was followed by a victory in the [[West Indies Triangular Series in 2013]] consisting of India, West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2014, India toured Bangladesh and England. Although they beat the former 2\u20130 in 3 One Day Internationals, Team India were beaten 3\u20131 in 5 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] by England. This series included a famous win for the Indian team in the first match of the series at Lord's. The Test series was followed by a 3\u20131 win for the Indians in a 5-match ODI series and a loss in a one-off T20, both against England.\n\nIndia failed to reach the final of the [[Asia Cup]] yet again in 2014. In the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]] hosted in Bangladesh, India narrowly missed out on another ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final. This tournament saw the rise of [[Virat Kohli]] as one of the best limited overs batsmen in world cricket, as he was adjudged the man of the series. India soon comprehensively beat Sri Lanka and West Indies in ODI series to cement their position at the top of the ODI rankings. India toured Australia towards the end of 2014 for a 4-match Test series, which is remembered for MS Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket after the end of the second Test. Virat Kohli was appointed as the captain of Team India in Test matches but he was unable to turn the series around and India lost 2\u20130. Kohli's first series win as captain came away from home in a 3-match Test series vs Sri Lanka, which signalled the beginning of an unbeaten Test series run for India.\n\n2015 saw the beginning of India's dominance at home in Test matches under new captain Virat Kohli when they comprehensively beat South Africa. This series was the beginning of an unbeaten streak of 19 Test matches for India which was brought to an end by Australia in early 2017. This series also saw the emergence of [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] and [[Ravindra Jadeja]] as two of the best spinners and all-rounders. They spun webs around touring batsmen, much like the spinning quartet of the 1970s. This was followed by limited overs victories over Australia and Sri Lanka away from home. India was knocked out of the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]] in the semi-final stage, to eventual winners Australia. India began 2016 by winning the [[2016 Asia Cup]], remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament, beating Pakistan along the way. India were favourites to win the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20]] which was being held at home, but they lost in the semi-final to eventual champions West Indies. Virat Kohli was again named the man of the series.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Grand Home Season\" began for India, including series at home against New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia. India whitewashed New Zealand to regain the number one ranking in Test cricket after almost 10 years. Before the series against England in November 2016, MS Dhoni resigned as captain of India in limited overs, thus handing the captaincy to Virat Kohli across all formats. India beat England across all three formats, with a notable 4\u20130 win in the Test series. This was followed by Test series wins against Bangladesh and Australia,  which meant India reclaimed the [[Border Gavaskar Trophy]].

In addition to their whites, Indian fielders wear a dark blue cap or a white wide-brimmed sun hat, with the BCCI logo in the center. Helmets are also dark blue. Some players sport the Indian flag on their helmet.\n\nThe branding is minimal for whites; the BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the team sponsor's (currently OPPO) logo is present on the right chest. The kit manufacturer's (Nike) logo would be printed on the sleeve of the players' leading arms.\n\n=== Limited overs ===\nSince colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour. The blue colour of the uniform has earned them the nickname of 'Men in Blue' for the Indian cricket team. The secondary colour has changed over the years while yellow and orange have been dominant. With the inception of the [[World Series Cup]] in 1979, each team had to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms and the Indian team elected to wear light blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. The team has worn different shades of blue since then. For the 1992 World Cup ([[1992 Cricket World Cup|Benson & Hedges World Cup]]), the team's colours were changed to navy-blue by [[ISC (sportswear)|ISC]], the common kit manufacturer for the tournament. A light shade of blue with yellow as secondary colour and a strip with 10 different colours (representing different nations) was adapted on the uniform for the 1996 World Cup ([[1996 Cricket World Cup|Wills World Cup]]) while an even lighter shade of blue and a dominant yellow was used by [[ASICS]], the common kit manufacturer for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. The ICC no longer appoints a common kit manufacturer for its tournaments.\n\nDifferent designs were adopted on the playing jerseys over the years and the most predominant one has been 'India' text written in yellow over a diagonal splash of the tricolour. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired the kit manufacturing rights for the team in 2005 and designed new jerseys for the 2007 World Cup with the lightest shade of blue used by the team till date and golden yellow as the secondary colour. A new tricolour accent was implemented on the right side of the jersey. The colour was changed to a darker feroza blue in 2009 with orange replacing yellow as the secondary colour.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Team India's new jersey unveiled | date=18 February 2009 | access-date=18 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220120150/http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | archive-date=20 February 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA New Jersey was unveiled by Nike with a bolder ultramarine blue shade<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|title=Team India dazzles in 'ultramarine' blue new jersey|date=20 October 2010|work=The Times of India|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044102/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and a new tricolour accent placed on both sides of the jersey in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|title=Team India gets new Nike ODI kit|work=Cricbuzz|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110012/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A reddish-orange shade was used as the secondary colour on this uniform.

The tricolour accent made a return to the uniform as a single thin strip on either sides of upper chest.\n\nIn addition to the blue uniforms, the caps worn by the players are similar to the design of uniforms. The wide-brimmed sun hats are usually white while the helmets used by the players are of darker blue.\n\nSimilar to the first-class kits, BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the logo of the kit manufacturer (Nike) sits on the right chest. The official team sponsor's logo (currently BYJU'S) is present on the central part of the jersey usually above 'INDIA' text as well as the sleeve of the players' leading arms. For T20 kits, in addition to these, the sponsor's logo is also present on the back, below the players' numbers.

Most grounds are under the administration of various state cricket boards as opposed to being under the control of the BCCI. The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team. This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877. The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in [[Bombay]] in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted. The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at [[Eden Gardens]] and [[Chepauk]]. The [[Feroz Shah Kotla Ground]] in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one [[List of Test cricket grounds|official Test match]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of world-class cricket stadiums in India, with multiple Test venues in [[Indore]], [[Chandigarh]] [[Mohali]], [[Chennai]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Rajkot]], [[Ranchi]], [[Pune]], [[Dharamshala]] and [[Nagpur]].\n\nEden Gardens in Kolkata has hosted the most Tests, and also has the second-largest [[seating capacity]] of any cricket stadium in the world, being capable of holding more than 66,000 spectators. Founded in 1864, it is one of the most historical stadiums in India, having hosted numerous historical and controversial matches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Eden Gardens |work = Cricinfo |accessdate = 21 September 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041632/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |archive-date = 6 October 2006 |url-status = live }}</ref> Other major stadiums in India include the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, which was established in 1883 and hosted memorable matches including Anil Kumble's ten wickets in an innings haul against Pakistan.

[[Wankhede Stadium]], established in 1974, has a capacity to hold 33,000 spectators and is currently the most popular venue in the city. It has hosted 24 Test matches. It was the unofficial successor of the Brabourne Stadium, which is also located in Mumbai. Mumbai is often considered the cricketing capital of India because of its fans and the talent it produces (see [[Mumbai cricket team]]) and thus the stadium regularly hosts major Test matches.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Wankhede Stadium|work = Cricinfo|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104024543/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|archive-date = 4 November 2006|url-status = live}}</ref> The [[M.

India's first captain was [[CK Nayudu]], who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933\u201334. [[Lala Amarnath]], India's fourth captain, led the team in its first Test match after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]]. He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952\u201353. From 1952 until 1961\u201362, India had a number of captains such as [[Vijay Hazare]], [[Polly Umrigar]] and [[Nari Contractor]].\n\nThe Nawab of Pataudi, [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi]], was the team's captain for 36 Test matches from 1961\u201362 to 1969\u201370, returning for another four matches against West Indies in 1974\u201375. In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia. However, in 1967\u201368, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3\u20131. In 1970\u201371, [[Ajit Wadekar]] took over the captaincy from Pataudi. Under Wadekar's captaincy, India registered its first Test series win in the West Indies and England. India played its first ODI in 1974, also under his captaincy. India won its first ODI under the captaincy of [[Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan]] in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup]], against [[East African cricket team|East Africa]]. Between 1975\u201376 and 1978\u201379, [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] captained the team in 22 Tests and 4 ODIs, winning 6 Tests and one ODI.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1983 Cricket WC.jpg|thumb|Kapil Dev led the Indian team to victory at the 1983 World Cup.]] -->\n[[Sunil Gavaskar]] took over as Test and ODI captain in 1978\u201379, leading India in 47 Test matches and 37 ODIs, winning 9 Tests and 14 ODIs. He was succeeded by [[Kapil Dev]] in the 1980s, who captained for 34 Test matches, including 4 victories. Kapil Dev led India to victory in 39 of his 74 ODIs in charge, including the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]]. Kapil Dev also captained India's 2\u20130 Test series victory in England in 1986. Between 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390, India had three captains in [[Dilip Vengsarkar]], Ravi Shastri and [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]. Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early-1989 and a stand-off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).\n\nIndia has had six regular Test captains since [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] took charge in 1989. Azharuddin led the team in 47 Test matches from 1989\u201390 to 1998\u201399, winning 14, and in 174 ODIs, winning 90. He was followed by Sachin Tendulkar, who captained the team in 25 Test matches and 73 ODIs in the late 1990s; Tendulkar was relatively unsuccessful<ref>{{cite news|title=Tendulkar on his captains: Ganguly was aggressive, Rahul methodical, Dhoni instinctive|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|accessdate=1 July 2015|work=[[Firstpost]]|date=7 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715070716/http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|title=Replacing Sachin with Azhar as captain in 1997: When selectors spun the ball|accessdate=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109181442/http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=live|date=6 November 2014}}</ref> as a captain, winning only 4 Test matches and 23 ODIs. He was replaced as ODI captain by [[Ajay Jadeja]] and then by [[Sourav Ganguly]].\n\nGanguly became the regular captain of the team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000. He remained captain until 2005\u201306 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49 Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. India lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia. [[Rahul Dravid]] took over as Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.\n\nIn September 2007, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] was named as the new captain of the ODI and [[T20I]] teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural World Twenty20]] title. [[Anil Kumble]] was appointed Test captain in November 2007, but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded him as the Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team held the number one position in the [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]] for 21 months (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine straight wins).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090213041951/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|url-status=dead|title=The Canadian Press: Sri Lanka denies India 5-0 rout by winning final ...|date=13 February 2009|archivedate=13 February 2009}}</ref> Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, with [[Virat Kohli]] being named as the new Test captain. Dhoni resigned as captain of the ODI and T20 teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.\n\nUnder Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3\u20130 series win over New Zealand and ending with a 2\u20131 series win over Australia. India has an unbeaten streak of winning 9 consecutive Test series as of Dec 2017, starting with a 2\u20131 series win over Sri Lanka. India also became only the third team after Australia and South Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli is India's most successful test captain, having won more than 61% of Test matches (at least 2 games).\n\n==Squad==\nThis lists all the players who have played for India in the past 12 months and the formats in which they have played.

He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs. The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by [[Virender Sehwag]] in Chennai. It is the second [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century in Test cricket]] by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan. The team's highest ever score was a 759/7 against England at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in 2016, while its lowest was 42 against England in 1974. In ODIs, the team's highest score is 418/5 against West Indies at Indore in 2011\u201312. India score 413\u20135 in a match against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] which is the highest score ever in Cricket World Cup history. In the same match, India set a world record of the highest winning margin in an ODI match of 257 runs.\n\nIndia has also had some very strong bowling figures, with spin bowler Anil Kumble being a member of the elite group of 3 bowlers who have taken 600 Test wickets. In 1999, Anil Kumble emulated [[Jim Laker]] to become the second bowler to take all ten wickets in a Test match innings when he took 10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[Delhi]].\n\nMany of the Indian cricket team's records are also [[Test cricket records|world records]], for example Sachin Tendulkar's century tally (in Tests and ODIs) and run tally (also in both Tests and ODIs). Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the world record score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. The Indian cricket team also holds the record sequence of 17 successful run-chases in ODIs,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-www1.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/248029.html|title = Dravid rues faulty execution|work=Cricinfo Staff| accessdate =21 September 2006|date = 21 May 2006}}</ref> which ended in a dramatic match against the West Indies in May 2006, which India lost by just 1 run when Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Dwayne Bravo's full toss.\n\nSachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to score 200 runs (he was unbeaten on 200 from 147 deliveries including 25x4 and 3x6) in a single ODI innings, on 24 February 2010 against South Africa in [[Gwalior]]. On 8 December 2011, this achievement was eclipsed by compatriot Virender Sehwag, who scored 219 runs from 149 deliveries (25x4 | 7x6) versus [[West Indies]] in [[Indore]]. On 13 November 2014 the record was broken by another Indian opening batsmen, [[Rohit Sharma]], who scored 264 runs from 173 deliveries (33x4 | 9x6) against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in Kolkata. In 2013, MS Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Virat Kohli became the first cricketer to win back-to-back man of the series awards in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]]. In 2017, Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer in history to reach 250 wickets. He and Ravindra Jadeja are considered to be the best bowlers in Test cricket and occupy the top two spots in the rankings for Test bowlers {{as of|2017|May|lc=y}}. Virat Kohli became the first captain in history to score double tons in three consecutive series, against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh in 2017.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|Indian cricket team records}}\n{{further|India national cricket team record by opponent}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Tests===\n{{main|List of India Test cricket records}}\n'''Test record versus other nations'''\n{{India Test cricket records by opponent}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n'''Most Test runs for India'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Cricket Records {{!}} Records {{!}} India {{!}} Test matches {{!}} Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1;id=6;type=team|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913072807/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1%3Bid%3D6%3Btype%3Dteam|archive-date=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket. This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI's]] financial success.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|title = 10,000 Visas for Pak Cricket Fans|work = The Tribune, Chandigarh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903055335/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|archive-date = 3 September 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold [[Cricket in India|cricket]] very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player [[effigy|effigies]] being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|title = Ganguly's Debt of Gratitude|work = BBC News|accessdate = 21 September 2006|date = 21 March 2003|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090113015842/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|archive-date = 13 January 2009|url-status = live}}</ref> In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at [[Brabourne Stadium]] in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks .<ref name=\"Riots\">{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|title = I predict a riot|work = Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson|accessdate = 22 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208133819/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|archive-date = 8 February 2007|url-status = live|date = 11 April 2006}}</ref> A similar event occurred during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], where India were losing the semi-final to Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens.

He was the partner of established character [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), and a father-figure to her four children. Tony [[child molestation|sexually abused]] Bianca's stepdaughter, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), and began [[child grooming|grooming]] her school-friend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]), before his predatory nature was uncovered and he was arrested for his crimes. Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial.\n\nThe child sexual abuse storyline marked the first time the subject matter had been broached in a UK soap opera, and was researched and developed with advice and approval from the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. The abusive nature of Tony and Whitney's relationship resulted in over 200 complaints being made to the BBC and television regulatory body [[Ofcom]] by members of the public,<ref name=\"Guardiancomp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/18/bbc.television|title=EastEnders paedophile storyline draws 200 complaints|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}</ref> with the storyline deemed \"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines ''EastEnders'' has ever attempted\" by ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Beth Neil.<ref name=\"darkest\" /> The NSPCC however praised the storyline for \"helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse\".<ref name=\"nspcc\" /> The storyline also gained ''EastEnders'' a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award in March 2009 in the Soap and Continuing Drama category.\n\n==Storylines==\n[[File:Patsy Palmer.jpg|thumb|[[Patsy Palmer]] plays Bianca, Tony's partner and the adoptive mother of his victim [[Whitney Dean]].]]\n\nAfter being released from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), Tony joins his partner [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and her family in [[Walford]], including her son [[Morgan Jackson-King]], whom he has adopted. It is revealed that he is a [[paedophile]] who has been [[Child grooming|grooming]] and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.\n\nTony begins grooming fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, supporting her when her mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans to take her to a concert, but Lauren's father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that they are going to leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.\n\nBefore his trial, Tony attempts suicide. Whitney tries to visit but is refused, and Bianca sees it as a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after the first day of the trial, he flushes the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, [[List of EastEnders characters (2009)#Mrs Taylor|Mrs Taylor]] ([[Jacqueline Defferary]]), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, [[Vivien Easley|Vivien Easley QC]] (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.\n\nOver three years later, Whitney receives a note from Tony via one of his former prison friends, saying that he always loved her. Whitney attempts to visit Tony in prison, but she is told that he killed himself in his cell.\n\n==Creation==\nTony was first mentioned in ''EastEnders'' in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year absence from the show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]) and [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, [[multiracial|mixed-race]] [[Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a107432/eastenders-morgan-whos-the-daddy.html|title='EastEnders' Morgan: Who's the Daddy?|first=Kris|last=Green|date=4 July 2008|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Tony did not appear in the show until September 2008, his arrival was anticipated from April of that year, when ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] commented that the series was building a picture of his character, and that it would be interesting to see him on-screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a94856/diederick-santer-executive-producer-eastenders.html|title=Diederick Santer (Executive Producer, 'EastEnders')|first=Kris|last=Green|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref> It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a [[child sexual abuse]] storyline involving Whitney.<ref name=\"arrival\"/> [[BBC News]] described the plot as an ongoing \"predatory paedophile storyline\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera.<ref name=\"beeb\">{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7613307.stm|title=Will sex offender pilots work?|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=15 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=40% |align=left|quote=\"Programmes like ''EastEnders'' are increasingly helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of [[sexual abuse]].

Tony [[child molestation|sexually abused]] Bianca's stepdaughter, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), and began [[child grooming|grooming]] her school-friend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]), before his predatory nature was uncovered and he was arrested for his crimes. Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial.\n\nThe child sexual abuse storyline marked the first time the subject matter had been broached in a UK soap opera, and was researched and developed with advice and approval from the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]].

It is revealed that he is a [[paedophile]] who has been [[Child grooming|grooming]] and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.\n\nTony begins grooming fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, supporting her when her mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans to take her to a concert, but Lauren's father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that they are going to leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.\n\nBefore his trial, Tony attempts suicide. Whitney tries to visit but is refused, and Bianca sees it as a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after the first day of the trial, he flushes the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, [[List of EastEnders characters (2009)#Mrs Taylor|Mrs Taylor]] ([[Jacqueline Defferary]]), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, [[Vivien Easley|Vivien Easley QC]] (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.\n\nOver three years later, Whitney receives a note from Tony via one of his former prison friends, saying that he always loved her. Whitney attempts to visit Tony in prison, but she is told that he killed himself in his cell.\n\n==Creation==\nTony was first mentioned in ''EastEnders'' in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year absence from the show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]) and [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, [[multiracial|mixed-race]] [[Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a107432/eastenders-morgan-whos-the-daddy.html|title='EastEnders' Morgan: Who's the Daddy?|first=Kris|last=Green|date=4 July 2008|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Tony did not appear in the show until September 2008, his arrival was anticipated from April of that year, when ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] commented that the series was building a picture of his character, and that it would be interesting to see him on-screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a94856/diederick-santer-executive-producer-eastenders.html|title=Diederick Santer (Executive Producer, 'EastEnders')|first=Kris|last=Green|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref> It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a [[child sexual abuse]] storyline involving Whitney.<ref name=\"arrival\"/> [[BBC News]] described the plot as an ongoing \"predatory paedophile storyline\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera.<ref name=\"beeb\">{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7613307.stm|title=Will sex offender pilots work?|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=15 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=40% |align=left|quote=\"Programmes like ''EastEnders'' are increasingly helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of [[sexual abuse]].

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year.

In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than {{convert|800,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline \u2013 a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on}} pipe compared to the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} Keystone XL \u2013 was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)\"\n* \"Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than {{convert|180000|oilbbl|USgal L}} in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than {{convert|160000|oilbbl|USgal L}} of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than {{convert|140000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Platte River crossing and more than {{convert|120000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Missouri River crossing.\"\n* \"Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

His son Ari is left behind and presumed dead. In the present, Max is seen waking up from a dream; upon waking up, she encounters other members of the Flock.Iggy explains that they're running out of food, but Max wants to remain in the house. Angel is then captured by Erasers. \n\nThe Flock returns to the house and find the schools location. They deice that Fang and Max will go to rescue Angel, while the others,\u00a0 will remain home. Ari went to the house looking for Max, but they fight him off and escape, but Ari is left alive. \n\nMax and Fang stop to eat on a rooftop in Utah, where Max hears a girl being attacked. Fang tells Max not to intervene, but Max flies down to help before being shot in the shoulder. Fang smashes the gunman through a window; the girl, Ella, tells him that her mother is a doctor. They rush Max to the veterinary practice where Max is operated on.\n\nIggy, Gazzy and Nudge are walking through a small town. Iggy has a plan to meet up with the others at Lake Mead. Gazzy realizes Nudge is gone; they find her in a clothing store but have no idea that Ari is watching them. \n\nMax is given the all clear by the doctor, who points out a tracking chip in her shoulder and she rejoins Fang, who is angry that Max intervened but she insists it was the right thing to do. Izzy, Gazzy and Nudge then meet up with them and Max tells them about the tracking chip. They tell her about the house and about Ari. Max leaves the cabin and Ari confronts her and seems about to overpower her, but Fang starts fighting him before he and The Flock are captured.\n\nThey recover at the School, in cages, but are initially overjoyed to find Angel. Ari arrives and escorts Max to where Jeb is waiting. Max no longer trusts Jeb who tells her that she was created to help people and save the world. He shows her a hidden note and tells her that it was Ari's choice to become an Eraser. Max leaves the room and distracts Ari enough to steal his key card.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the whitecoats is secretly reporting on Jeb to another authority. The woman says that the Flock is expendable, but dangerous, and must be controlled.\n\nAri returns to the cage room to taunt Max, but Max has unlocked her cage and jumps on him. She hands the key card to Iggy before Ari chases her out of the room and the Flock escapes from their cages. Ari and the Erasers corner Max, only for the Flock to arrive with a bomb made by Gazzy. Max leaps out of the way and escapes safely. Jeb arrives, calling Ari's name. The Flock stands there, watching. Jeb pleads with Max, telling her she doesn't understand but she tells him the experiments over and opens her wings.\n\nAfterwards, the Flock walks through the woods. They pause and Max comforts Angel, only to collapse. She sees a vision of events throughout the movie, of child Ari moving to stab her with the scissors, and of New York City. When she awakens, she describes it to the Flock and they decide to go to New York City to look for more answers. The final shot is a video playing over and over again, of Max's final words to Jeb: \"The experiment's over.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* Allie Marie Evans as Max\n* [[Patrick Johnson (actor)|Patrick Johnson]] as Fang\n* Lyliana Wray as Angel\n* Luke Gregory Crosby as Ari\n* Gavin Lewis as Gazzy\n* Tetona Jackson as Nudge\n* [[Zayne Emory]] as Iggy\n* [[Peter O'Brien (actor)|Peter O'Brien]] as Jeb\n* [[Tina Huang]] as Dr. Rosen\n* Lillie Owers as Young Max\n\n==Reception==\nFrank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing \"You've seen it before, and done a lot better.\"<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|last=Scheck|first=Frank|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/maximum-ride-review-934238|title='Maximum Ride': Film Review|date=September 30, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref><!-- only 1 reviews listed at Rotten Tomatoes. <ref>{{cite web|title=Maximum Ride|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maximum_ride/|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref> -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0825283}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|maximum_ride}}\n\n[[Category:2016 films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by James Patterson]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films based on young adult literature]]\n", "name_user": "71.215.142.117", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePlot)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_Ride_(film)"}
