As it has developed alongside [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], Singapore became known as one of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers]]\".\n\nIn the late 1960s through the 1970s, Singapore faced a severe unemployment and a housing crisis. The country then embarked on a rapid modernization programme beginning that focused on establishing a manufacturing industry, developing large public housing estates and investing heavily on public education and infrastructure.\n\nBy the 1990s, the country had become one of the world's most prosperous nations, with a highly [[economic development|developed]] [[free market economy]], strong [[international trade|international trading]] links, and the highest per capita gross domestic product in Asia outside [[Japan]], which Singapore surpassed in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|title=World Economic Outlook Database|date=September 2006|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/02/data/index.aspx|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gaubrvhB?url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/02/data/index.aspx|archivedate=7 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nToday, Singapore is one of the five founding members of [[ASEAN]], is the headquarters of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) Secretariat and [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] (PECC) Secretariat,<ref>{{cite web |title=PECC: The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council \u2013 International Secretariat |url= https://www.pecc.org/about/pecc-international-secretariat |website=pecc.org}}</ref> is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[East Asia Summit]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and is a recurrent guest invitee to the annual [[G20]] summit;<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore remains top Asian city for meetings |url= https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-remains-top-asian-city-for-meetings |work=The Straits Times |date=9 September 2015 |location=Singapore}}</ref> its outsized influence on global affairs, relative to its size, has lead to it being classified as a [[middle power]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/middle-power-moment|title=A middle-power moment|website=www.lowyinstitute.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brinknews.com/how-the-middle-powers-are-determining-asias-power-balance/|title=How the Middle Powers Are Determining Asia\u2019s Power Balance|first=Herv\u00e9|last=Lemahieu|website=Brink \u2013 News and Insights on Global Risk}}</ref> The country is the most [[developed country|developed]] sovereign nation in Asia, being ranked 9th on the UN [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]], and has the 7th [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|highest GDP per capita]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&ey=2024&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=60&pr1.y=11&c=137,516,453,576,178&s=NGDPD,PPPGDP,NGDPDPC,PPPPC&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org|access-date=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2018&ey=2018&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=55&pr1.y=9&c=512,946,914,137,612,546,614,962,311,674,213,676,911,548,193,556,122,678,912,181,313,867,419,682,513,684,316,273,913,868,124,921,339,948,638,943,514,686,218,688,963,518,616,728,223,836,516,558,918,138,748,196,618,278,624,692,522,694,622,142,156,449,626,564,628,565,228,283,924,853,233,288,632,293,636,566,634,964,238,182,662,359,960,453,423,968,935,922,128,714,611,862,321,135,243,716,248,456,469,722,253,942,642,718,643,724,939,576,644,936,819,961,172,813,132,726,646,199,648,733,915,184,134,524,652,361,174,362,328,364,258,732,656,366,654,734,336,144,263,146,268,463,532,528,944,923,176,738,534,578,536,537,429,742,433,866,178,369,436,744,136,186,343,925,158,869,439,746,916,926,664,466,826,112,542,111,967,298,443,927,917,846,544,299,941,582,446,474,666,754,668,698,672&s=PPPPC&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org|access-date=7 October 2019}}</ref> It is also considered by [[Transparency International]] to be the most [[Corruption Perceptions Index|incorruptible]] nation in Asia, and the fifth most incorruptible worldwide.\n\n==Background==\nAfter gaining independence abruptly, Singapore faced a future filled with uncertainties. The [[Konfrontasi]] was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of [[natural resource]]s and land.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Two Decades of Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\n\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year. Foreign minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151550/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 July 2009|title=Former DPM Rajaratnam dies at age 90|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore.

The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence/> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\n\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of [[squatter]] settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire]] in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestone \u2013 1888\u20131990|publisher=[[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]|accessdate =17 July 2006|url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510204004/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archivedate=10 May 2006}}</ref> The [[Housing Development Board]] set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters.

During the 1980s, Singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological industries, such as the [[wafer fabrication]] sector, in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour.

These new residential estates have larger and higher-standard apartments and are served with better amenities. Today, 80\u201390% of the population lives in HDB apartments.

The [[Konfrontasi]] was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of [[natural resource]]s and land.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Two Decades of Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\n\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year. Foreign minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151550/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 July 2009|title=Former DPM Rajaratnam dies at age 90|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore.

The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence/> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\n\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of [[squatter]] settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire]] in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestone \u2013 1888\u20131990|publisher=[[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]|accessdate =17 July 2006|url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510204004/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archivedate=10 May 2006}}</ref> The [[Housing Development Board]] set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters.

In commemoration of the significant milestone, the 2015 National Day Parade was the first ever parade to be held both at the Padang and the Float at Marina Bay. NDP 2015 was the first National Day Parade without the founding leader [[Lee Kuan Yew]], who never missed a single National Day Parade since 1966.\n\nIn 2019, [[Jewel Changi Airport]] opened on the landside of [[Changi Airport]], the main airport serving Singapore. It was conceived to maintain Changi Airport's status as a major aviation hub in the Asia-Pacific.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jewel-at-changi-will-offer-travellers-stunning-welcome?login=true|title=Jewel at Changi will offer travelers stunning welcome|last=migration|date=2013-08-20|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117190548/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jewel-at-changi-will-offer-travellers-stunning-welcome?login=true|archive-date=2018-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> It was first mentioned by Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] in his [[Singapore National Day Rally|National Day Rally]] speech in 2013 as part of Changi Airport's long-term plans to double its capacity by the mid-2020s and \"create more opportunities for Singapore and Singaporeans\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/terminal-5-will-double-changi-airports-capacity-pm-lee|title=Terminal 5 will double Changi Airport\u2019s capacity: PM Lee|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117190432/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/terminal-5-will-double-changi-airports-capacity-pm-lee|archive-date=2018-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXVYc_IDygw |title=Expanding Changi Airport for 2030 and Beyond - National Day Rally 2013|work=govsingapore youtube channel uploaded 22 Aug 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Singapore}}\n*[[Economy of Singapore]]\n*[[Taiwan Miracle]]\n*[[Japanese economic miracle]]\n*[[Miracle on the Han River]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Singapore topics}}\n\n[[Category:Economic booms]]\n[[Category:Economy of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Post\u2013World War II economic booms]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, addedorphantag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Miracle"}

He played mainly as a [[right midfielder]] but could also play as a [[central midfielder]].\n\nElliott began playing football as a youth player for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] before joining non-league [[Bashley F.C.|Bashley]]. He began his professional career at [[AFC Bournemouth]] after joining from Bashley for \u00a35,000. After five years he joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] where he won two player of the year awards and scored the only goal in the [[2009 Football League Championship play-off Final|2009 play-off final]] elevating his team to the [[Premier League]]. He moved on to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2011, playing regularly for two seasons. He spent time on loan at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in 2014, and joined them on a permanent contract after his release from Birmingham at the end of the 2013\u201314 season.\n\nHaving achieved promotion from [[Football League One|League One]] to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] with Bristol City in the [[2014-15 Football League|2014-15]] season, Elliott retired from playing in June 2015 in order to take up a coaching role at the club.

{"title_page": "American Civil War alternate histories", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\n\n'no\nDepictions of the later development of a victorious Confederacy vary considerably from each other &ndash; especially on two major, interrelated issues: an independent Confederacy's treatment of its [[African-American|Black]] population and its relations with the rump United States to its north.\n\n==Scenarios==\n\n* The South wins the Civil War, and Slavery still exists as of the present time of the story. Examples include the 2004 [[mockumentary]] ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'', the United States is annexed by the Confederate States and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] continues up to the present, including a depiction of \"an electronic slave auction\" carried on via the internet. \n\n* The Victorious South ends slavery, examples include: The 1900 ''Hallie Marshall: A True Daughter of the South'' by Frank Williams, the earliest known Civil War alternate history, the Confederacy won by mobilizing black slaves to its army, their participation turning the tide at Gettysburg. Thirty years later, the independent Confederacy is full of happy, well-treated Black slaves feeling perfectly content under the benevolent, paternalistic planters - comparing favorably with the rump US which is torn by a brutal class struggle, with nominally free factory workers protesting inhuman working conditions or starving in unemployment.  In ''[[Gray Victory]]'', set in the immediate aftermath of the war, the Confederacy is faced with both subversion by Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] and the increasing organization and assertiveness of [[Black Southerners]] themselves, and the story gives the clear impression that, no matter who wins, the end of slavery is inevitable.\n\n* Slavery ends in the South, but either it ends in name only or minorities are oppressed into low socioeconomic parts of society. Examples include: ''[[The Guns of the South]]'', freeing the slaves is attributed to [[Robert E. Lee]], who in all these works becomes the second [[Confederate President]]. It is logical to assume that his prestige would have run high, making him a plausible candidate to succeed [[Jefferson Davis]], although the [[Robert E. Lee#Lee's views on slavery|position he would have taken regarding slavery]] is the subject of some debate. However, ending slavery would not necessarily provide equality for Black Southerners., and ''Bring the Jubilee'', Blacks, despite President Lee's grand gesture, remain disenfranchised into the 20th Century (as are the people of [[Latin America]] who were in this timeline annexed by the Confederacy and the Confederacy's immigrant population). The rump United States is completely broken down by its defeat, becoming an impoverished and backward country while the Confederacy goes on to annex everything to its south as far as [[Tierra del Fuego]] (barring the [[Republic of Haiti]]) and become a major world power. In Harry Turtledove's ''[[Southern Victory]]'' series &ndash; where it is President [[James Longstreet]] who frees the slaves from being property, as a prerequisite for retaining [[British Empire|British]] and [[Third French Republic|French]] support for the Confederacy in the [[How Few Remain|Second Mexican War]], but Confederate Blacks remain a very oppressed and discriminated underclass, denied basic [[civil rights]] and not even being allowed to have [[surnames]]. In later volumes of the series the Blacks burst out in a brutal armed revolt called the Red Rebellion during the Great War which are met with equal brutality from White authorities, who then make them the target of a terrible [[Holocaust]]-like genocide. \n\n* A more optimistic result occur in ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' and several other works, where the two nations settle down into reasonable good neighborly relations within a few years of the war's end, and in some cases agree to reunite as one nation after 50 or 100 years of being apart. ''[[If the South Had Won the Civil War]]'' by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], reunification comes later: during the 20th Century the United States, Confederate States of America and Texas (which seceded from the C.S.) become economically integrated and in both World Wars, they all fight against Germany as close allies. Following [[World War II]], U.S., C.S., and Texas all feel threatened by Soviet missile bases and armored brigades in [[Alaska]] (which was never purchased from Russia). Therefore, they announce a formal reunification in 1961, on the precise centennial of [[Fort Sumter]]. Conversely, a [[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Dixie-1|GURPS game setting book]] presents a 1993 in which the U.S. and C.S. still watch each other warily across an armed border that stretches to the Pacific.\n\n* Near Continuous War ''[[Southern Victory]]'' The USA and CSA develop into hereditary enemies who go to war again every decade or two and who spend the rest of the time preparing for new war, becoming entangled in webs of worldwide military alliances. ''Southern Victory'', U.S. and Confederacy are drawn into the [[World War I|worldwide war]] immediately following the [[Assassination in Sarajevo|Archduke's murder]], and open an American front of [[trench warfare]], every bit as terrible as the ones in Europe. Conversely, the 1914 of \"A Hard Day for Mother\" in ''Alternate Generals'' 1 by [[William R. Forstchen]] sees the amicable treaty of reconciliation and voluntary reunification between the two nations.\n\n==Examples==\n{{split|1=List of alternate histories diverging at the American Civil War|section=list|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Fiction===\n\n====Novels====\n\n* ''[[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter]]'', by [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], re-casts the Civil War as a war on [[vampire]]s using [[slaves]] as a food source.\n* \"Beyond the Wildest Dreams of [[John Wilkes Booth]]\" by [[Jay Winik]], first printed in ''[[What Ifs? of American History]]'', a scenario in which John Wilkes Booth not only assassinates Abraham Lincoln but he also is successful in assassinating [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William H.

The [[American Civil War]] is a popular [[point of divergence]] in English-language alternate history fiction. The most common variant of these detail the victory and survival of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]. Less common variants include a [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] victory under different circumstances than in actual history, resulting in a different post-war situation; [[African-American]] [[slaves]] freeing themselves by revolt without waiting for [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] [[Emancipation Proclamation]]; a direct [[British Empire|British]] and/or [[Second French Empire|French]] intervention in the war; the survival of Lincoln during [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination attempt]]; a retelling of historical events with [[fantasy]] elements inserted; the Civil War never breaking out and a peaceful compromise being reached; and [[secret history]] tales. The [[point of divergence]] in such a story can either be a \"natural, realistic\" event (such as one general making a different decision than he did in our timeline, or one sentry detecting an enemy invasion which he failed to notice in reality), or else it can be an \"unnatural\" fantasy/[[science fiction]] plot device such as [[time travel]], which usually takes the form of someone bringing modern weapons or hindsight knowledge into the past. Still another related variant are scenarios of a Civil War breaking out at a different time than 1861 and under different circumstances (e.g. The North rather than The South seceding from the Union). American Civil War alternate histories are one of the two most popular points of divergence to create an [[alternate history]] in the [[English language]], the other being an [[Axis victory in World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/october.html |title=Alternate History Month Contest |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |last=Silver |first=Steven |publisher=Steven Silver's SF Web Site}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uchronia.net/ |title=Uchronia: The Alternate History List |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |last=Schmunk |first=Robert B.|year=2008 |work=Online database | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217152005/http://www.uchronia.net/| archivedate= December 17, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=SH>{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020715/time.shtml |title=The Time of the Other: Alternate History and the Conquest of Britain |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |author=Fred Bush |date=July 15, 2002 |publisher=[[Strange Horizons]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103121939/http://strangehorizons.com/2002/20020715/time.shtml |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDepictions of the later development of a victorious Confederacy vary considerably from each other &ndash; especially on two major, interrelated issues: an independent Confederacy's treatment of its [[African-American|Black]] population and its relations with the rump United States to its north.\n\n==Scenarios==\n\n* The South wins the Civil War, and Slavery still exists as of the present time of the story. Examples include the 2004 [[mockumentary]] ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'', the United States is annexed by the Confederate States and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] continues up to the present, including a depiction of \"an electronic slave auction\" carried on via the internet. \n\n* The Victorious South ends slavery, examples include: The 1900 ''Hallie Marshall: A True Daughter of the South'' by Frank Williams, the earliest known Civil War alternate history, the Confederacy won by mobilizing black slaves to its army, their participation turning the tide at Gettysburg. Thirty years later, the independent Confederacy is full of happy, well-treated Black slaves feeling perfectly content under the benevolent, paternalistic planters - comparing favorably with the rump US which is torn by a brutal class struggle, with nominally free factory workers protesting inhuman working conditions or starving in unemployment.  In ''[[Gray Victory]]'', set in the immediate aftermath of the war, the Confederacy is faced with both subversion by Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] and the increasing organization and assertiveness of [[Black Southerners]] themselves, and the story gives the clear impression that, no matter who wins, the end of slavery is inevitable.\n\n* Slavery ends in the South, but either it ends in name only or minorities are oppressed into low socioeconomic parts of society. Examples include: ''[[The Guns of the South]]'', freeing the slaves is attributed to [[Robert E. Lee]], who in all these works becomes the second [[Confederate President]]. It is logical to assume that his prestige would have run high, making him a plausible candidate to succeed [[Jefferson Davis]], although the [[Robert E. Lee#Lee's views on slavery|position he would have taken regarding slavery]] is the subject of some debate. However, ending slavery would not necessarily provide equality for Black Southerners., and ''Bring the Jubilee'', Blacks, despite President Lee's grand gesture, remain disenfranchised into the 20th Century (as are the people of [[Latin America]] who were in this timeline annexed by the Confederacy and the Confederacy's immigrant population). The rump United States is completely broken down by its defeat, becoming an impoverished and backward country while the Confederacy goes on to annex everything to its south as far as [[Tierra del Fuego]] (barring the [[Republic of Haiti]]) and become a major world power. In Harry Turtledove's ''[[Southern Victory]]'' series &ndash; where it is President [[James Longstreet]] who frees the slaves from being property, as a prerequisite for retaining [[British Empire|British]] and [[Third French Republic|French]] support for the Confederacy in the [[How Few Remain|Second Mexican War]], but Confederate Blacks remain a very oppressed and discriminated underclass, denied basic [[civil rights]] and not even being allowed to have [[surnames]]. In later volumes of the series the Blacks burst out in a brutal armed revolt called the Red Rebellion during the Great War which are met with equal brutality from White authorities, who then make them the target of a terrible [[Holocaust]]-like genocide. \n\n* A more optimistic result occur in ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' and several other works, where the two nations settle down into reasonable good neighborly relations within a few years of the war's end, and in some cases agree to reunite as one nation after 50 or 100 years of being apart. ''[[If the South Had Won the Civil War]]'' by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], reunification comes later: during the 20th Century the United States, Confederate States of America and Texas (which seceded from the C.S.) become economically integrated and in both World Wars, they all fight against Germany as close allies. Following [[World War II]], U.S., C.S., and Texas all feel threatened by Soviet missile bases and armored brigades in [[Alaska]] (which was never purchased from Russia). Therefore, they announce a formal reunification in 1961, on the precise centennial of [[Fort Sumter]]. Conversely, a [[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Dixie-1|GURPS game setting book]] presents a 1993 in which the U.S. and C.S. still watch each other warily across an armed border that stretches to the Pacific.\n\n* Near Continuous War ''[[Southern Victory]]'' The USA and CSA develop into hereditary enemies who go to war again every decade or two and who spend the rest of the time preparing for new war, becoming entangled in webs of worldwide military alliances. ''Southern Victory'', U.S. and Confederacy are drawn into the [[World War I|worldwide war]] immediately following the [[Assassination in Sarajevo|Archduke's murder]], and open an American front of [[trench warfare]], every bit as terrible as the ones in Europe. Conversely, the 1914 of \"A Hard Day for Mother\" in ''Alternate Generals'' 1 by [[William R. Forstchen]] sees the amicable treaty of reconciliation and voluntary reunification between the two nations.\n\n==Examples==\n{{split|1=List of alternate histories diverging at the American Civil War|section=list|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Fiction===\n\n====Novels====\n\n* ''[[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter]]'', by [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], re-casts the Civil War as a war on [[vampire]]s using [[slaves]] as a food source.\n* \"Beyond the Wildest Dreams of [[John Wilkes Booth]]\" by [[Jay Winik]], first printed in ''[[What Ifs? of American History]]'', a scenario in which John Wilkes Booth not only assassinates Abraham Lincoln but he also is successful in assassinating [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William H.

It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.\n* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].\n[[File:Anatolian Greek dialects.png|thumb|Distribution of varieties of Greek in [[Anatolia]], 1910.

''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.\n* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell|title=Greek|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialects]] of it.\n\n===Diglossia===\n{{Main|Greek language question}}\n\nIn the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of [[diglossia]]: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Standard Modern Greek|Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in [[education in Greece|education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter|first=Mackridge|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-815770-0|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}</ref>\n\n===Historical unity===\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]\n\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.<ref>{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.</ref> It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages.

The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.\n\n===Phonology===\n{{See also|Modern Greek phonology}}\n\n[[File:Seferisrede.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Modern Greek]]]]\n\nAcross its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):\n* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].\n* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]).\n* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|\u03c6]], [[Theta|\u03b8]], and [[Chi (letter)|\u03c7]]).\n* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} (later {{IPA|/v/}}), {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding<ref>{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164\u2013203}}.</ref> and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.\n\n==== Nouns and adjectives ====\nPronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).{{NoteTag|The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.}} Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Ancient Greek\n! Modern Greek\n|-\n!

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 \"Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited\", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.}} and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)\n|-\n! Voice\n| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]\n| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]\n|}\n\n===Syntax===\nMany aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.</ref> some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words have evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]/[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) and [[Eastern Romance languages]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).\n\n===Greek loanwords in other languages===\n{{details|Greek and Latin roots in English}}\n\nGreek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: ''[[mathematics]]'', ''[[physics]]'', ''[[astronomy]]'', ''[[democracy]]'', ''[[philosophy]]'', ''[[:wikt:athletics|athletics]], [[theatre]], [[rhetoric]]'', ''[[baptism]]'', ''[[:wikt:evangelist|evangelist]]'', etc. Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''[[anthropology]]'', ''[[photography]]'', ''[[telephony]]'', ''[[isomer]]'', ''[[biomechanics]]'', ''[[cinematography]]'', etc. and form, with [[Scientific Latin|Latin words]], the [[International scientific vocabulary|foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary]] like all words ending with ''\u2013logy'' (\"discourse\").

It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the [[vowel]]s. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (\u03c2) used in the final position:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[upper case]]\n|-\n|[[Alpha|\u0391]]||[[Beta|\u0392]]||[[Gamma|\u0393]]||[[Delta (letter)|\u0394]]||[[Epsilon|\u0395]]||[[Zeta|\u0396]]||[[Eta|\u0397]]||[[Theta|\u0398]]||[[Iota|\u0399]]||[[Kappa|\u039a]]||[[Lambda|\u039b]]||[[Mu (letter)|\u039c]]||[[Nu (letter)|\u039d]]||[[Xi (letter)|\u039e]]||[[Omicron|\u039f]]||[[Pi (letter)|\u03a0]]||[[Rho|\u03a1]]||[[Sigma|\u03a3]]||[[Tau|\u03a4]]||[[Upsilon|\u03a5]]||[[Phi|\u03a6]]||[[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]]||[[Psi (letter)|\u03a8]]||[[Omega|\u03a9]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[lower case]]\n|-\n|\u03b1||\u03b2||\u03b3||\u03b4||\u03b5||\u03b6||\u03b7||\u03b8||\u03b9||\u03ba||\u03bb||\u03bc||\u03bd||\u03be||\u03bf||\u03c0||\u03c1||\u03c3<br />\u03c2||\u03c4||\u03c5||\u03c6||\u03c7||\u03c8||\u03c9\n|}\n\n====Diacritics====\n{{main|Greek diacritics}}\n\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].\n\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\n====Punctuation====\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (\u2022), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}).

It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.\n* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].\n[[File:Anatolian Greek dialects.png|thumb|Distribution of varieties of Greek in [[Anatolia]], 1910.

''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.\n* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell|title=Greek|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century.

What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Standard Modern Greek|Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in [[education in Greece|education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter|first=Mackridge|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-815770-0|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}</ref>\n\n===Historical unity===\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]\n\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.<ref>{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.</ref> It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages.

The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.\n\n===Phonology===\n{{See also|Modern Greek phonology}}\n\n[[File:Seferisrede.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Modern Greek]]]]\n\nAcross its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):\n* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].\n* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]).\n* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|\u03c6]], [[Theta|\u03b8]], and [[Chi (letter)|\u03c7]]).\n* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} (later {{IPA|/v/}}), {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0263/}}.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding<ref>{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164\u2013203}}.</ref> and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.\n\n==== Nouns and adjectives ====\nPronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).{{NoteTag|The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.}} Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Ancient Greek\n! Modern Greek\n|-\n!

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 \"Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited\", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.}} and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)\n|-\n! Voice\n| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]\n| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]\n|}\n\n===Syntax===\nMany aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\n===Vocabulary===\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.</ref> some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words have evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]/[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) and [[Eastern Romance languages]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).\n\n===Greek loanwords in other languages===\n{{details|Greek and Latin roots in English}}\n\nGreek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: ''[[mathematics]]'', ''[[physics]]'', ''[[astronomy]]'', ''[[democracy]]'', ''[[philosophy]]'', ''[[:wikt:athletics|athletics]], [[theatre]], [[rhetoric]]'', ''[[baptism]]'', ''[[:wikt:evangelist|evangelist]]'', etc. Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''[[anthropology]]'', ''[[photography]]'', ''[[telephony]]'', ''[[isomer]]'', ''[[biomechanics]]'', ''[[cinematography]]'', etc. and form, with [[Scientific Latin|Latin words]], the [[International scientific vocabulary|foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary]] like all words ending with ''\u2013logy'' (\"discourse\").

It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the [[vowel]]s. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (\u03c2) used in the final position:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[upper case]]\n|-\n|[[Alpha|\u0391]]||[[Beta|\u0392]]||[[Gamma|\u0393]]||[[Delta (letter)|\u0394]]||[[Epsilon|\u0395]]||[[Zeta|\u0396]]||[[Eta|\u0397]]||[[Theta|\u0398]]||[[Iota|\u0399]]||[[Kappa|\u039a]]||[[Lambda|\u039b]]||[[Mu (letter)|\u039c]]||[[Nu (letter)|\u039d]]||[[Xi (letter)|\u039e]]||[[Omicron|\u039f]]||[[Pi (letter)|\u03a0]]||[[Rho|\u03a1]]||[[Sigma|\u03a3]]||[[Tau|\u03a4]]||[[Upsilon|\u03a5]]||[[Phi|\u03a6]]||[[Chi (letter)|\u03a7]]||[[Psi (letter)|\u03a8]]||[[Omega|\u03a9]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"33\" | [[lower case]]\n|-\n|\u03b1||\u03b2||\u03b3||\u03b4||\u03b5||\u03b6||\u03b7||\u03b8||\u03b9||\u03ba||\u03bb||\u03bc||\u03bd||\u03be||\u03bf||\u03c0||\u03c1||\u03c3<br />\u03c2||\u03c4||\u03c5||\u03c6||\u03c7||\u03c8||\u03c9\n|}\n\n====Diacritics====\n{{main|Greek diacritics}}\n\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].\n\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\n====Punctuation====\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (\u2022), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}). In Greek the [[comma]] also functions as a [[silent letter]] in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing {{lang|el|{{linktext|\u03cc,\u03c4\u03b9}}}} (''\u00f3,ti'', \"whatever\") from {{lang|el|{{linktext|\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9}}}} (''\u00f3ti'', \"that\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Nicolas |first=Nick |title=Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation |year=2005 |url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |accessdate=7 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAncient Greek texts often used ''scriptio continua'' ('continuous writing'), which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The concise Oxford dictionary of linguistics|last=Hugoe|first=Matthews Peter|date=March 2014|publisher=|others=Oxford University Press.|isbn=978-0-19-967512-8|edition=Third|location=[Oxford]|pages=|oclc=881847972}}</ref>  [[Boustrophedon]], or bi-directional text, was also used in Ancient Greek.\n\n===Latin alphabet===\nGreek has occasionally been written in the [[Latin script]], especially in areas under [[Stato da M\u00e0r|Venetian rule]] or by [[Roman Catholicism in Greece|Greek Catholics]].
