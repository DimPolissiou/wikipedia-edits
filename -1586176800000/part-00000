After one year at [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], he signed for [[Juventus]] for \u20ac25&nbsp;million in 2009. Melo spent four seasons at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], playing 154 total games and winning eight honours including three [[S\u00fcper Lig]] titles. After a spell back in [[Serie A]] with [[Inter Milan]], he returned to Brazil in 2017 by signing for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], where he soon won the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]] in 2018.\n                                                                                  \nMelo was a [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] from 2009 to 2010, earning 22 caps and scoring two goals.

After one year at [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], he signed for [[Juventus]] for \u20ac25&nbsp;million in 2009. Melo spent four seasons at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], playing 154 total games and winning eight honours including three [[S\u00fcper Lig]] titles. After a spell back in [[Serie A]] with [[Inter Milan]], he returned to Brazil in 2017 by signing for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], where he soon won the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]] in 2018.\n                                                                                  \nMelo was a [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] from 2009 to 2010, earning 22 caps and scoring two goals.

At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the [[1344 Yellow River flood|1332\u201333 flood]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[1887 Yellow River flood|1887 flood]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a [[Republic of China era]] 1931 flood (part of [[1931 China floods|a massive number of floods that year]]) that killed 1\u20134 million people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|year=2012|page=47|isbn=9780393081923|title-link=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things}}</ref>\n\nThe cause of the floods is the large amount of [[fine-grained]] [[loess]] carried by the river from the [[Loess Plateau]], which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.<ref name=\"Gascoigne\">Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}</ref>\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)</ref>\n\nBefore modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.<ref name=\"Treg\">Tregear, T.

At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the [[1344 Yellow River flood|1332\u201333 flood]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[1887 Yellow River flood|1887 flood]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a [[Republic of China era]] 1931 flood (part of [[1931 China floods|a massive number of floods that year]]) that killed 1\u20134 million people.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.<ref name=\"Gascoigne\">Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}</ref>\n\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)</ref>\n\nBefore modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding.

The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of  \"using water as a substitute for soldiers\" (''yishui daibing''). The [[1938 Yellow River flood|1938 flood]] of an area covering {{convert|54000|km\u00b2|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}} took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers.

The source tributaries drain into [[Gyaring Lake]] and [[Ngoring Lake]] on the western edge of [[Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golog Prefecture]] high in the Bayan Har Mountains of [[Qinghai]]. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with [[Gansu]], the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"[[Ordos Loop]]\", and then flows generally eastward across the [[North China Plain]] to the [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Bohai]], draining a [[drainage basin|basin]] of {{convert|752443|km\u00b2|sp=us|0}} which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day [[Province (China)|provinces]] and two [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], namely (from west to east) [[Qinghai]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Inner Mongolia, [[Shaanxi]], Shanxi, [[Henan]], and [[Shandong]]. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) [[Lanzhou]], [[Yinchuan]], [[Wuhai]], [[Baotou]], [[Luoyang]], [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kaifeng]], and [[Jinan]]. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at [[Kenli County]], Shandong.\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the [[Ordos Loop]], and the [[North China Plain]]. However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This article adopts the division used by the [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]].<ref>[http://www.yellowriver.gov.cn/ Yellow River Conservancy Commission].

Holdrinet.jpg|thumb|Near [[Xunhua]], [[Qinghai]].]]\n[[File:VM 6056 Liujiaxia Town.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia]], [[Gansu]].]]\n\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town ([[Togtoh County]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of {{convert|3472|km|0|sp=us}} and total basin area of {{convert|386000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops {{convert|3496|m|0|sp=us}}, with an average [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 0.10%.\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and the Anemaqen ([[Amne Machin]]) Mountains in [[Qinghai]]. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7&nbsp;billion and 10.8&nbsp;billion m\u00b3 (166 and 381 billion ft<sup>3</sup>), respectively. At elevations over {{convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on}}) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.  A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve]], to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the [[Yangtze]], and the [[Mekong]].\n\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters [[Maqu County]] in [[Gansu]].  Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the [[Zoig\u00ea Marsh|Zoig\u00ea Wetlands]] and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and [[Zoig\u00ea County]] in [[Sichuan]].  Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at [[Xinghai County|Xinghai]].\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the [[Longyang]], Jishi, [[Liujiaxia Dam|Liujia]], Bapan, and [[Qingtong]] gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.  The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge.  Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of [[Lanzhou]] is built upon the Yellow River's banks.  The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into [[Ningxia]] before the Qingtong Gorge.\n\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast [[alluvial plain]]s, the [[Yinchuan Plain]] and [[Hetao Plain]]. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly [[deserts]] and [[grasslands]], with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of {{convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and width of {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\n\n===Middle reaches===\n{{main|Ordos Loop}}\n[[File:Landzhou 07-2005.jpg|right|thumb|At [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Shapotou.jpg|thumb|At [[Shapotou]], [[Ningxia]]]]\n[[File:Qiankun Bend.jpg|thumb|Qiankun bend in [[Yonghe County]]]]\n[[File:Luoyang-most.przez.rzeke.LuoHe.przed.ujsciem.do.HuangHe.jpg|thumb|At [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]]]\nThe [[Ordos Loop]] formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at [[Zhongning County]] in [[Ningxia]] and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the [[Wei River|Wei]] at [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]] in [[Shaanxi]]. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from [[Hekou, Togtoh County|Hekou]] in [[Togtoh County]], [[Inner Mongolia]], to [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]. The middle reaches are {{convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a basin area of {{convert|344000|km\u00b2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of {{convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the [[Loess Plateau]], where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most [[sediment]]-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91&nbsp;billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3 (57.4&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the [[river bed]] and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous [[Hukou Waterfall]] is in the lower part of this valley on the border of [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]].\n\n===Lower reaches===\nIn the lower reaches, from [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] to its mouth, a distance of {{convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the river is confined to a [[levee]]-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the [[North China Plain]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Bohai|Bohai Sea]]. The basin area in this stage is only {{convert|23000|km\u00b2|sp=us}}, a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the [[Huai River]], whereas those to the north drain into the [[Hai River]]. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Gonghuan |last2=Zhuang |first2=Dafang |title=Atlas of the Huai River Basin Water Environment: Digestive Cancer Mortality |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401786195 |page=143}}</ref> The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is {{convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with an average grade of 0.012%.\n\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. At [[Kaifeng]], Henan, the Yellow River is {{convert|10|m|sp=us|0}} above the ground level.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214151633/http://emw21.com/CTS/GeorgeLeung/YRiver/geofo/geogren.html |author=Leung, George |title=Reclamation and Sediment Control in the Middle Yellow River Valley |journal=Water International |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=12\u201319 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/02508069608686482}}</ref>\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:5922-Daxia-River-fall-into-Liujiaxia-Reservoir.jpg|thumb|The mouth of the [[Daxia River]] (coming from bottom right), flowing into the Yellow River's [[Liujiaxia Reservoir]] in [[Linxia Prefecture]], [[Gansu]]]]\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\n*[[White River (China)|White River]] \n*[[Ejin River|Black River]] \n*[[Huangshui River|Huang Shui]] \n**[[Datong River]] \n*[[Daxia River]] \n*[[Tao River]] \n*[[Zuli River]] \n*[[Qingshuihe River|Qingshui River]]\n*[[Dahei River]] \n*[[Kuye River]] \n*[[Wuding River]] \n*[[Fen River]] \n*[[Wei River]] (the Wei River is the largest of these tributaries)\n*[[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] \n*[[Qin River]] \n*[[Dawen River]] \n*[[Kuo River]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2009}}\n[[File:Yellow River Delta Animation.gif|thumb|Expansion of the Yellow River Delta from 1989 to 2009 in five year intervals.]]\n\nThe Yellow River is notable for the large amount of [[silt]] it carries\u20141.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the [[Loess Plateau]]. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and 1 for the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Treg\"/>\n\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural [[irrigation]], increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 (48,572&nbsp;mi\u00b2) of land.<ref name=\"video.nytimes.com\">[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2007/05/30/world/asia/1194817118362/chinas-yellow-river-part-1.html China's Yellow River, Part 1]. ''The New York Times'' (2007-05-30)</ref> The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090&nbsp;mi\u00b2).

Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]] involves several schemes to divert water from the [[Yangtze River]]: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], and a third using the route of the old [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] stream{{spaced ndash}}that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between [[levee|natural levee]]s in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Hydroelectric power dams==\n[[File:6058-Liujiaxia-Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia Dam]], [[Gansu]]]]\n[[File:Smxgongcheng zengmian.jpg|thumb|[[Sanmenxia Dam]], [[Henan]]]]\nBelow is the list of [[hydroelectric]] power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\n\n*[[Sanmenxia Dam]]  (1960; [[Sanmenxia]], Henan)\n*[[Sanshenggong Dam]] (1966)\n*[[Qingtong Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1968; [[Qingtongxia]], Ningxia)\n*[[Liujiaxia Dam]] (Liujia Gorge) (1974; [[Yongjing County]], Gansu)\n*[[Lijiaxia Dam]] (1997) ([[Jainca County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Yanguoxia Dam]] (Yanguo Gorge) hydroelectric power station (1975; Yongjing County, Gansu)\n*[[Tianqiao Dam]] (1977)\n*[[Bapanxia Dam]] (Bapan Gorge) (1980; [[Xigu District]], [[Lanzhou]], Gansu)\n*[[Longyangxia Dam]]  (1992; [[Gonghe County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Da Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1998)\n*[[Li Gorge]] hydroelectric power station (1999)\n*[[Wanjiazhai Dam]] (1999; [[Pianguan County]], Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia)\n*[[Xiaolangdi Dam]] (2001) ([[Jiyuan]], Henan)\n*[[Laxiwa Dam]] (2010) ([[Guide County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Yangqu Dam]] (2016) ([[Xinghai County]], Qinghai)\n*[[Maerdang Dam]] (2018) ([[Maq\u00ean County]], Qinghai)\n\nAs reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/english/200012/14/eng20001214_57817.html Yellow River Upstream Important to West-East Power Transmission]  People's Daily, 14 December 2000</ref>\n\n==Crossings==\n[[File:Major cities along the Yellow River.svg|right|thumb|450px|Major cities along the Yellow River]]\n[[File:Yellow river pontoon bridge jinan 2008 05.jpg|thumb|[[Pontoon bridge]] (Luokou Pontoon Bridge {{zh\n|s={{linktext|\u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6865}}\n|t=\u6d1b\u53e3\u6d6e\u6a4b\n|p=Lu\u00f2k\u014fu F\u00faqi\u00e1o}}) over the Yellow River in [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]]]]\nThe main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Shandong]]\n* [[Dongying Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Shengli Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Dongying]])\n* [[Lijin Yellow River Bridge]] (Dongying)\n* [[Binzhou Yellow River Road-Railway Bridge]]\n* [[Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge]]\n* [[Binzhou\u2013Laiwu Expressway Binzhou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Binzhou]]\u2013[[Zibo]])\n* [[Huiqing Yellow River Bridge]] (Binzhou\u2013Zibo)\n* [[Jiyang Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Jinan]])\n* [[G20 Qingdao\u2013Yinchuan Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan)\n* [[Jinan Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge]] (Jinan)\n* [[Jinan Jianbang Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-speed Railway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013[[Dezhou]])\n* [[Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway Jinan Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway Jinan Yellow River New Bridge]] (Jinan\u2013Dezhou)\n* [[Pingyin Yellow River Bridge]] (Jinan-[[Liaocheng]])\n\nShandong\u2013[[Henan]]\n* [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway Sunkou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Jining]]\u2013[[Puyang]])\n* [[Juancheng Yellow River Highway Bridge]] ([[Heze]]\u2013Puyang)\n* [[Dongming Yellow River Highway Bridge]] (Heze\u2013Puyang)\n\nHenan\n* [[Kaifeng Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Kaifeng]])\n* [[Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Zhengzhou]])\n\n[[Shanxi]]\u2013Henan\n* [[Sanmen Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Sanmenxia]])\n\n[[Shaanxi]]\u2013Henan\n* [[Hancheng Yumenkou Yellow River Bridge]]\n\n[[Ningxia]]\n* [[Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Yinchuan]])\n\n[[Inner Mongolia]]\n* [[Baotou Yellow River Bridge]] ([[Baotou]])\n\n[[Gansu]]\n* [[Lanzhou Yellow River Bridge]]\n* [[Zhongshan Bridge]] ([[Lanzhou]])\n\n[[Qinghai]]\n* [[Dari Yellow River Bridge]]\n<!--* Zalinghu crossing-->\n\n==Fauna==\n===Fish===\n[[File:DV Paradise fish male 03.jpg|thumb|The [[paradise fish]] is well-known in the aquarium hobby and it originates from East Asian river basins, including the Yellow River]]\n\nThe Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 [[genera]] and 28 [[Family (biology)|families]], including 19 species found nowhere else in the world ([[Endemism|endemic]]).<ref name=Xie2018>{{cite journal | author1=Xie, J.Y. | author2=W.J.

The name was selected on March 8<!--, 1975--> from more than 3,000 entries in an open contest.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sMZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mNkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2312%2C2420048 |title=New soccer team to be 'Timbers' |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|date=March 10, 1975 |page=3C}}</ref> In their inaugural season of 1975, the Timbers went to the championship game, [[Soccer Bowl '75]], but lost to the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] 2\u20130.  It was during this season that the Timbers endeared themselves to the City and Portland became known as \"Soccer City USA\".  While the Timbers boasted some of the league's best fan support, they sometimes struggled on the field.  Despite going to the championship game in their first season, they missed the playoffs in 1976 and 1977.  In 1978, they went to the Conference Finals before falling to the [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]].\n\nThe team folded at the end of the 1982 season as player salaries outpaced team revenue.  These Timbers established soccer as a sport in the greater Portland area.  Their legacy lives on in the current Timbers following and the many thousands who continue to play and follow the game.  Many of these Timbers continued to live in the area after their playing careers and helped establish the soccer as a vital local sport.\n\n== F.C. Portland Days (1985&ndash;1990) ==\n\n{{main|Portland Timbers (1985\u20131990)}}\n\nIn 1985, F.C. Portland joined with three other independent clubs, the U.S. based [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|F.C. Seattle]] and [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974\u20131988)|San Jose Earthquakes]] and the Canadian [[Victoria Riptides]] in a home and away round robin tournament, known as the [[Western Soccer League|Western Alliance Challenge Series]]. The four teams also played the Canadian [[Edmonton Brickmen]] and the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canadian national team]].  The games against the Brickmen counted in the standings which determined the end of series champions.\n\nF.C. Portland had the honor of hosting the first game of the series, against Seattle.  The game, played in Portland's Civic Center, attracted 2,906 fans.\n\nF.C. Portland also played a game against the [[Houston Dynamos (LSSA)|Houston Dynamos]] in [[Houston]].\n\nAfter the success of 1985, the three U.S. teams elected to form a league, which they named the Western Soccer Alliance.  While the Victoria Riptides opted out of the league, the [[Edmonton Brickmen]] joined the alliance, along with the [[California Kickers|Hollywood Kickers]], [[Los Angeles Heat]] and  [[San Diego Nomads]].  The teams continued the first year practice of playing outside teams ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] this year) with results counting in the alliance standings.\n\nF.C. Portland saw a significant improvement over the previous season.  Behind the production of forwards [[Brent Goulet]] (league leading 9 goals and 2 assists), and [[Mark Miller (soccer)|Mark Miller]] (7 goals and  5 assists), the team finished second in the standings with a 6-6-2 record.   At the time, Goulet played for [[Warner Pacific College]], a local school.  He played with F.C. Portland as an amateur.\n\nIn 1986, former Timbers player [[Clive Charles]] began coaching the [[Portland Pilots|University of Portland]] (U.P.) men's soccer team, bringing this team to national prominence.  This led to an infusion of U.P. players into F.C. Portland in later years.\n\nIn 1987, Edmonton dropped from the alliance to join the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] and the Hollywood Kickers changed their name to the California Kickers.  The league also reduced the number of games from 12 to 10.  Despite Brent Goulet's outstanding play, which led to his selection as the season MVP, F.C. Portland finished fourth in the standings and missed out on the alliance's first playoff, won by the [[San Diego Nomads]].\n\nAt the end of the season, the team lost Goulet when he finished his four years at [[Warner Pacific College]] and signed with British club [[AFC Bournemouth]].\n\n1988 saw F.C. Portland drop to the bottom of the end of year standings despite once again having the alliance's leading scorer, [[Scott Benedetti]] with 8 goals and no assists.  At the time Benedetti was between his junior and senior year playing soccer for [[Clive Charles]] at the University of Portland. The alliance kept the same teams as the 1987 season, but played 12 games, including games against [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] teams, [[Calgary Kickers]] and [[Vancouver 86ers]].  F.C. Portland finished 1-11.\n\nThis year the alliance named an [[All Star]] team.  Ironically, not only did Portland have the alliance's top scorer, but also had its goalkeeper, [[Todd Strobeck]], named to the alliance's [[All Star]] team.\n\nIn 1989, F.C. Portland went through several changes.  First, Art Dixon, a local businessman, took control of F.C. Portland and renamed it the Portland Timbers.  Dixon was a long time Timbers fan, holding season tickets from 1979 through the team's last season in 1982.  Dixon brought more than a name change, he also injected money and a higher level of professionalism into the team, bringing former Timbers great [[John Bain (soccer)|John Bain]] back as a player/coach.  Then, the Western Soccer Alliance became the Western Soccer League (WSL).  More importantly for Portland, the WSL added three new teams, [[Real Santa Barbara]], [[Arizona Condors]] and [[Sacramento Senators (soccer)|Sacramento Senators]].  To accommodate the new teams, the Western Soccer League split into two divisions \u2013 North and South.  The Portland Timbers joined the former San Jose Earthquakes, now known as the [[San Francisco Bay Blackhawks]]; the [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|F.C. Seattle]], now known as the [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|Seattle Storm]]; and the new [[Sacramento Senators (soccer)|Sacramento Senators]] in the North Division.\n\nPortland made yet another wild swing in the standings from the previous season.  Improving from 1-11, Portland finished the year at 11-5 and tied with the Blackhawks for the North Division lead.  The Blackhawks won the division championship, and the playoff berth, based on goal differential.\n\nThe team continued its tradition of placing its players on the end of year honors lists.  Goalkeeper [[Kasey Keller]] was selected as the league's MVP. Additionally, Portland placed Keller, midfielder/coach [[John Bain (soccer)|John Bain]] and forward [[Scott Benedetti]] on the WSL All Star team.  At the time, Keller was also playing [[College soccer|NCAA soccer]] with the University of Portland.\n\nIn February 1990, the WSL announced it had reached a merger agreement with the [[American Soccer League (1988-1989)|American Soccer League]], which had teams along the east coast.  The new league was named the [[American Professional Soccer League]].  The APSL was split into East and West Conferences, both with North and South Divisions.  The Portland Timbers remained in the North Division, which also had the [[San Francisco Bay Blackhawks]], [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|Seattle Storm]] and newly established [[Salt Lake Sting]] and [[Colorado Foxes]].\n\nThis year, Portland's final, the team finished with a 10\u201310 record and out of playoff contention.  This was also the first year the team failed to garner any individual player honors.  Its leading goal scorer, [[Shawn Medved]] with 10 goals and 2 assists, was seventh on the league's scoring list.  [[Kasey Keller]] had also moved on after playing in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and then signing with British club [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Scott Benedetti]] had transferred to Seattle.\n\nAt the end of the season, the high hopes which had come with the merger between the WSL and APSL crashed.  Over half of the teams from the 1990 season, including Portland, would not return for the 1991 season.  Team owner Art Dixon folded the team, having lost more than $500,000 over the two years he owned the team.\n\n== USL Days (2001&ndash;2010) ==\n\n{{main|Portland Timbers (2001&ndash;2010)}}\n\n[[Image:Portland Timbers FC.jpg|thumb|Portland Timbers]]\nThrough the 2003 season, the Timbers compiled an inconsistent record, qualifying for league playoffs two out of the three years.  Nonetheless, they established themselves as one of the best-drawing teams in the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]], averaging attendance above 5,000 in each of their four years of existence.\n\nIn the 2004 season, the Timbers finished first in the Western Conference, with a record of 18 wins, 7 losses, and 3 draws (57 points).  However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by their long-standing rival, the [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]].\n\nIn, 2005, the Timbers managed an end of the year playoff run, ended by rival club [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]].  However, many exciting moments went along with the 2005 season, including a 6-1 thumping of the [[Atlanta Silverbacks]] on September 8, 2005; Portland being the only team to give the [[Montreal Impact]] a home loss, and Timbers players [[Scot Thompson]], [[Hugo Alcaraz-Cuellar]], and [[Dan Antoniuk]] winning league awards.\n\n2006 was a very disappointing season for many reasons for the Portland Timbers, and their fans. [[Chris Agnello]]'s single season as Timbers manager was one of the worst in club history. The Timbers finished tied for last in the table with a franchise worst 7-15-6 (27 points) record. The offensive production was last in the league as the club only netted 25 goals, and the Timbers lost their derby with heated rival [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]].\n\n2007 had many moments for the Timbers. Portland finished second in the league, with first going to rival [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]]. They enjoyed successful friendlies against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] (2-1), [[Club Necaxa]] (1-0) and [[Toronto FC]] (4-1) whilst drawing even with the [[A.C. Milan]] [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera|Primavera]] squad (1-1) and winning on penalties, and went unbeaten at home during the regular season.\n\n2008 was a disappointing year to most Timbers' fans for many reasons, although this was offset by the record high season attendances. The team finished dead last with a 7-13-10 record, scored a league worst 26 goals, while conceding 33. However, the 2008 Portland Timbers attendance grew 25.5% averaging 8,567 fans (second in the USL-1 behind Montreal Impact), and [[Cameron Knowles]] won an All-League Second Team spot.\n\n2009 was a record-setting season for the Timbers. They went unbeaten for a USL-1 record 24 matches in a row, which started following a 1\u20130 loss to Vancouver in the first game of the season,<ref>[http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/356175.html United Soccer Leagues (USL)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817235808/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/356175.html |date=2009-08-17 }}</ref> and ended with a Sept 3 defeat to Rochester Rhinos at PGE Park.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2009/09/timbers_lose_to_rhinos_21_unbe.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Timbers lose to Rhinos 2-1; unbeaten streak ends at 24 games | date=September 3, 2009}}</ref> They finished their season at the top of the table (16-4-10 58 points) winning The Commissioner's Cup and a first round bye in the playoffs.

It was during this season that the Timbers endeared themselves to the City and Portland became known as \"Soccer City USA\".  While the Timbers boasted some of the league's best fan support, they sometimes struggled on the field.  Despite going to the championship game in their first season, they missed the playoffs in 1976 and 1977.  In 1978, they went to the Conference Finals before falling to the [[New York Cosmos (1971\u20131985)|New York Cosmos]].\n\nThe team folded at the end of the 1982 season as player salaries outpaced team revenue.  These Timbers established soccer as a sport in the greater Portland area.  Their legacy lives on in the current Timbers following and the many thousands who continue to play and follow the game.  Many of these Timbers continued to live in the area after their playing careers and helped establish the soccer as a vital local sport.\n\n== F.C. Portland Days (1985&ndash;1990) ==\n\n{{main|Portland Timbers (1985\u20131990)}}\n\nIn 1985, F.C. Portland joined with three other independent clubs, the U.S. based [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|F.C.

The four teams also played the Canadian [[Edmonton Brickmen]] and the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canadian national team]].  The games against the Brickmen counted in the standings which determined the end of series champions.\n\nF.C. Portland had the honor of hosting the first game of the series, against Seattle.  The game, played in Portland's Civic Center, attracted 2,906 fans.\n\nF.C. Portland also played a game against the [[Houston Dynamos (LSSA)|Houston Dynamos]] in [[Houston]].\n\nAfter the success of 1985, the three U.S. teams elected to form a league, which they named the Western Soccer Alliance.  While the Victoria Riptides opted out of the league, the [[Edmonton Brickmen]] joined the alliance, along with the [[California Kickers|Hollywood Kickers]], [[Los Angeles Heat]] and  [[San Diego Nomads]].  The teams continued the first year practice of playing outside teams ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] this year) with results counting in the alliance standings.\n\nF.C. Portland saw a significant improvement over the previous season.  Behind the production of forwards [[Brent Goulet]] (league leading 9 goals and 2 assists), and [[Mark Miller (soccer)|Mark Miller]] (7 goals and  5 assists), the team finished second in the standings with a 6-6-2 record.   At the time, Goulet played for [[Warner Pacific College]], a local school.  He played with F.C. Portland as an amateur.\n\nIn 1986, former Timbers player [[Clive Charles]] began coaching the [[Portland Pilots|University of Portland]] (U.P.) men's soccer team, bringing this team to national prominence.  This led to an infusion of U.P. players into F.C. Portland in later years.\n\nIn 1987, Edmonton dropped from the alliance to join the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] and the Hollywood Kickers changed their name to the California Kickers.  The league also reduced the number of games from 12 to 10.  Despite Brent Goulet's outstanding play, which led to his selection as the season MVP, F.C. Portland finished fourth in the standings and missed out on the alliance's first playoff, won by the [[San Diego Nomads]].\n\nAt the end of the season, the team lost Goulet when he finished his four years at [[Warner Pacific College]] and signed with British club [[AFC Bournemouth]].\n\n1988 saw F.C. Portland drop to the bottom of the end of year standings despite once again having the alliance's leading scorer, [[Scott Benedetti]] with 8 goals and no assists.  At the time Benedetti was between his junior and senior year playing soccer for [[Clive Charles]] at the University of Portland. The alliance kept the same teams as the 1987 season, but played 12 games, including games against [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] teams, [[Calgary Kickers]] and [[Vancouver 86ers]].  F.C. Portland finished 1-11.\n\nThis year the alliance named an [[All Star]] team.  Ironically, not only did Portland have the alliance's top scorer, but also had its goalkeeper, [[Todd Strobeck]], named to the alliance's [[All Star]] team.\n\nIn 1989, F.C. Portland went through several changes.  First, Art Dixon, a local businessman, took control of F.C. Portland and renamed it the Portland Timbers.  Dixon was a long time Timbers fan, holding season tickets from 1979 through the team's last season in 1982.  Dixon brought more than a name change, he also injected money and a higher level of professionalism into the team, bringing former Timbers great [[John Bain (soccer)|John Bain]] back as a player/coach.  Then, the Western Soccer Alliance became the Western Soccer League (WSL).  More importantly for Portland, the WSL added three new teams, [[Real Santa Barbara]], [[Arizona Condors]] and [[Sacramento Senators (soccer)|Sacramento Senators]].  To accommodate the new teams, the Western Soccer League split into two divisions \u2013 North and South.  The Portland Timbers joined the former San Jose Earthquakes, now known as the [[San Francisco Bay Blackhawks]]; the [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|F.C. Seattle]], now known as the [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|Seattle Storm]]; and the new [[Sacramento Senators (soccer)|Sacramento Senators]] in the North Division.\n\nPortland made yet another wild swing in the standings from the previous season.  Improving from 1-11, Portland finished the year at 11-5 and tied with the Blackhawks for the North Division lead.  The Blackhawks won the division championship, and the playoff berth, based on goal differential.\n\nThe team continued its tradition of placing its players on the end of year honors lists.  Goalkeeper [[Kasey Keller]] was selected as the league's MVP. Additionally, Portland placed Keller, midfielder/coach [[John Bain (soccer)|John Bain]] and forward [[Scott Benedetti]] on the WSL All Star team.  At the time, Keller was also playing [[College soccer|NCAA soccer]] with the University of Portland.\n\nIn February 1990, the WSL announced it had reached a merger agreement with the [[American Soccer League (1988-1989)|American Soccer League]], which had teams along the east coast.  The new league was named the [[American Professional Soccer League]].  The APSL was split into East and West Conferences, both with North and South Divisions.  The Portland Timbers remained in the North Division, which also had the [[San Francisco Bay Blackhawks]], [[Seattle Storm (soccer)|Seattle Storm]] and newly established [[Salt Lake Sting]] and [[Colorado Foxes]].\n\nThis year, Portland's final, the team finished with a 10-10 record and out of playoff contention.  This was also the first year the team failed to garner any individual player honors.  Its leading goal scorer, [[Shawn Medved]] with 10 goals and 2 assists, was seventh on the league's scoring list.  [[Kasey Keller]] had also moved on after playing in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and then signing with British club [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Scott Benedetti]] had transferred to Seattle.\n\nAt the end of the season, the high hopes which had come with the merger between the WSL and APSL crashed.  Over half of the teams from the 1990 season, including Portland, would not return for the 1991 season.  Team owner Art Dixon folded the team, having lost more than $500,000 over the two years he owned the team.\n\n== USL Days (2001&ndash;2010) ==\n\n{{main|Portland Timbers (2001&ndash;2010)}}\n\n[[Image:Portland Timbers FC.jpg|thumb|Portland Timbers]]\nThrough the 2003 season, the Timbers compiled an inconsistent record, qualifying for league playoffs two out of the three years.  Nonetheless, they established themselves as one of the best-drawing teams in the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]], averaging attendance above 5,000 in each of their four years of existence.\n\nIn the 2004 season, the Timbers finished first in the Western Conference, with a record of 18 wins, 7 losses, and 3 draws (57 points).  However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by their long-standing rival, the [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]].\n\nIn, 2005, the Timbers managed an end of the year playoff run, ended by rival club [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]].  However, many exciting moments went along with the 2005 season, including a 6-1 thumping of the [[Atlanta Silverbacks]] on September 8, 2005; Portland being the only team to give the [[Montreal Impact]] a home loss, and Timbers players [[Scot Thompson]], [[Hugo Alcaraz-Cuellar]], and [[Dan Antoniuk]] winning league awards.\n\n2006 was a very disappointing season for many reasons for the Portland Timbers, and their fans. [[Chris Agnello]]'s single season as Timbers manager was one of the worst in club history. The Timbers finished tied for last in the table with a franchise worst 7-15-6 (27 points) record. The offensive production was last in the league as the club only netted 25 goals, and the Timbers lost their derby with heated rival [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]].\n\n2007 had many moments for the Timbers. Portland finished second in the league, with first going to rival [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]]. They enjoyed successful friendlies against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] (2-1), [[Club Necaxa]] (1-0) and [[Toronto FC]] (4-1) whilst drawing even with the [[A.C. Milan]] [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera|Primavera]] squad (1-1) and winning on penalties, and went unbeaten at home during the regular season.\n\n2008 was a disappointing year to most Timbers' fans for many reasons, although this was offset by the record high season attendances. The team finished dead last with a 7-13-10 record, scored a league worst 26 goals, while conceding 33. However, the 2008 Portland Timbers attendance grew 25.5% averaging 8,567 fans (second in the USL-1 behind Montreal Impact), and [[Cameron Knowles]] won an All-League Second Team spot.\n\n2009 was a record-setting season for the Timbers. They went unbeaten for a USL-1 record 24 matches in a row, which started following a 1-0 loss to Vancouver in the first game of the season,<ref>[http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/356175.html United Soccer Leagues (USL)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817235808/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/356175.html |date=2009-08-17 }}</ref> and ended with a Sept 3 defeat to Rochester Rhinos at PGE Park.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2009/09/timbers_lose_to_rhinos_21_unbe.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Timbers lose to Rhinos 2-1; unbeaten streak ends at 24 games | date=September 3, 2009}}</ref> They finished their season at the top of the table (16-4-10 58 points) winning The Commissioner's Cup and a first round bye in the playoffs.

This region has always been known for excellent agricultural soils, a spectacular wildlife environment and an enjoyable climate.\n\nPeople were originally attracted from the tobacco belt in Virginia and the Carolinas to the Highland Rim for land speculation and production of dark tobacco. The Highland Rim offered ideal climate and soil conditions for growing dark tobacco. This lucrative crop increased the value of the land, which benefited land speculators in the area. Eventually these speculators moved on to attempt profits elsewhere. The farmers, however, remained.\n\nThe oldest local settlement in Portland is Fountain Head, which is located a couple of miles south of Portland. This settlement was founded 1792 by the James Gwin family. Within a century, it grew to include a mill, tobacco factory, post office, a [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] depot, and a number of local retail stores.\n\nWilliam Nolan built a school near Shun Pike in what is now Portland. This stimulated community growth. Portland was originally called Richland. In 1859, the L&N Railroad opened the Nashville-Bowling Green route through Portland. In the same year, a train depot was built in Richland along the railroad on property owned by Thomas Buntin. Buntin was appointed as the depot's first agent and later became Richland's first postmaster. The depot stimulated development in the village. Even today, the railroad runs directly through the center of town.\n\nThe first public high school in Sumner County was originally started as a seminary in 1874. It was later named Sumner County High School and opened in 1915.\n\nIn 1887, there were two towns in Tennessee named Richland. Officials of the L&N railroad were worried that a telegraph mix-up might result in a train wreck. Postal customers complained of inconvenience as mail was frequently misdirected between the two Richlands. The Railroad administrators and postal authorities decided that Richland in Sumner County would be renamed as Portland to avoid this confusion. The new name was effective on April 10, 1888. Portland was incorporated in April 1904 by legislation passed by the Tennessee Assembly.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, Portland is growing at a fast pace buoyed by the growth of the Nashville Metropolitan Area. Daido America operates its US headquarters in Portland. Companies such as Kyowa America and Unipres have manufacturing plants in the city as well.<ref>[http://www.areadevelopment.com/newsItems/2-24-2015/unipres-expansion-portland-tennessee566343.shtml \"Unipres expansion in Portland\"], 24 February 2015Area Development</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|11.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and 0.09% is water.\n\nPortland is the northern terminus of [[U.S. Bicycle Route 23]].\n\n==Farming==\nPortland is considered the strawberry capital of Tennessee.<ref>http://www.portlandtn.com/strawberries.htm</ref>\n\n[[File:Portland, Tennessee Business District 9-28-2013.JPG|thumb|left|Portland, Tennessee Business District]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 579\n|1920= 869\n|1930= 1030\n|1940= 1212\n|1950= 1660\n|1960= 2424\n|1970= 2872\n|1980= 4030\n|1990= 5165\n|2000= 8458\n|2010= 11480\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=12823\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|date=June 27, 2019|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR9\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-03-04|title=Census of Population and Housing: Decennial Censuses}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 Census data===\nAs of the 2010 Census Portland had a population of 11,480.

This region has always been known for excellent agricultural soils, a spectacular wildlife environment and an enjoyable climate.\n\nPeople were originally attracted from the tobacco belt in Virginia and the Carolinas to the Highland Rim for land speculation and production of dark tobacco. The Highland Rim offered ideal climate and soil conditions for growing dark tobacco. This lucrative crop increased the value of the land, which benefited land speculators in the area. Eventually these speculators moved on to attempt profits elsewhere. The farmers, however, remained.\n\nThe oldest local settlement in Portland is Fountain Head, which is located a couple of miles south of Portland. This settlement was founded 1792 by the James Gwin family. Within a century, it grew to include a mill, tobacco factory, post office, a [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] depot, and a number of local retail stores.\n\nWilliam Nolan built a school near Shun Pike in what is now Portland. This stimulated community growth. Portland was originally called Richland. In 1859, the L&N Railroad opened the Nashville-Bowling Green route through Portland. In the same year, a train depot was built in Richland along the railroad on property owned by Thomas Buntin. Buntin was appointed as the depot\u2019s first agent and later became Richland\u2019s first postmaster. The depot stimulated development in the village. Even today, the railroad runs directly through the center of town.\n\nThe first public high school in Sumner County was originally started as a seminary in 1874. It was later named Sumner County High School and opened in 1915.\n\nIn 1887, there were two towns in Tennessee named Richland. Officials of the L&N railroad were worried that a telegraph mix-up might result in a train wreck. Postal customers complained of inconvenience as mail was frequently misdirected between the two Richlands. The Railroad administrators and postal authorities decided that Richland in Sumner County would be renamed as Portland to avoid this confusion. The new name was effective on April 10, 1888. Portland was incorporated in April 1904 by legislation passed by the Tennessee Assembly.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, Portland is growing at a fast pace buoyed by the growth of the Nashville Metropolitan Area. Daido America operates its US headquarters in Portland. Companies such as Kyowa America and Unipres have manufacturing plants in the city as well.<ref>[http://www.areadevelopment.com/newsItems/2-24-2015/unipres-expansion-portland-tennessee566343.shtml \"Unipres expansion in Portland\"], 24 February 2015Area Development</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|11.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and 0.09% is water.\n\nPortland is the northern terminus of [[U.S. Bicycle Route 23]].\n\n==Farming==\nPortland is considered the strawberry capital of Tennessee.<ref>http://www.portlandtn.com/strawberries.htm</ref>\n\n[[File:Portland, Tennessee Business District 9-28-2013.JPG|thumb|left|Portland, Tennessee Business District]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 579\n|1920= 869\n|1930= 1030\n|1940= 1212\n|1950= 1660\n|1960= 2424\n|1970= 2872\n|1980= 4030\n|1990= 5165\n|2000= 8458\n|2010= 11480\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=12823\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|date=June 27, 2019|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR9\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-03-04|title=Census of Population and Housing: Decennial Censuses}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 Census data===\nAs of the 2010 Census Portland had a population of 11,480.

Fisherman from Ouvidor and surrounding settlements would then leave their homes in order to hunt whales: due to the decline of whaling the outpost was abandoned.\n\nThere is one religious meeting-point in the faj\u00e3: the [[Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Dores (Velas)|Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Dores]], which dates to 1903, and includes old images created in the parish of Norte Grande.\n\nIn 1948 a formal roadway was opened to the public, from the principal viewpoint to the coast.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, vista geral, Norte Grande, Velas, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, vista geral.]]\n[[File:Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, povoado, Norte Grande, Velas, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, povoado.]]\n[[File:Vista Parcia da Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Vista Parcia da Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nThe faj\u00e3 is known for the geological feature along the coast, including the many ''po\u00e7as'', or tidal pools (such as the ''Po\u00e7a Jo\u00e3o Dias'' and ''Po\u00e7o do Carneiro''). The lava fields generated many natural pools that support protected natural swimming areas, the largest being the ''Po\u00e7a de Sim\u00e3o Dias''. Similarly, the faj\u00e3's coast is dotted by grottoes and coves, formed by marine erosion, including the ''Furna do Lobo'', a cove approximately {{convert|50|m|ft}} long and only accessible by boat.\nAmong the waterways that descend from the flanks of Norte Pequeno are the ''Ribeira da Casa Velha'' (supporting eels). the ''Grotinha do Fur\u00e3o'' and the ''Ribeira do Ilh\u00e9u'', supported by two important springs: the ''Abelheira'', situated alongside the roadway to Ouvidor, and the ''Caminho Velho'' on the otherside of the main square.\n\n===Biome===\nThe more abundant species of fish in the waters include: [[Sparisoma cretense|Mediterranean parrotfish]] (''Sparisoma cretense''), [[moray eel]], [[anchovy]], [[grouper]], [[wrasse]], in addition to [[crab]]s and [[limpet]]s.\nMarine and terrestrial birds vary throughout the year, influenced by migratory patterns and climate. In addition to local [[terns]], [[shearwater]]s and [[heron]]s, the faj\u00e3 is visited by [[wagtail]]s, [[Passer|sparrows]] and [[common blackbird]] (''Turdus merula'') throughout the year, with other species arriving in the summer months.\n\n===Human geography===\nThe faj\u00e3 is occupied by couple of dozen homes, some dating back centuries. But, less than half those homes are constantly inhabited throughout the year.

Fisherman from Ouvidor and surrounding settlements would then leave their homes in order to hunt whales: due to the decline of whaling the outpost was abandoned.\n\nThere is one religious meeting-point in the faj\u00e3: the [[Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Dores (Velas)|Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Dores]], which dates to 1903, and includes old images created in the parish of Norte Grande.\n\nIn 1948 a formal roadway was opened to the public, from the principal viewpoint to the coast.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, vista geral, Norte Grande, Velas, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, vista geral.]]\n[[File:Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, povoado, Norte Grande, Velas, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, povoado.]]\n[[File:Vista Parcia da Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Vista Parcia da Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nThe faj\u00e3 is known for the geological feature along the coast, including the many ''po\u00e7as'', or tidal pools (such as the ''Po\u00e7a Jo\u00e3o Dias'' and ''Po\u00e7o do Carneiro''). The lava fields generated many natural pools that support protected natural swimming areas, the largest being the ''Po\u00e7a de Sim\u00e3o Dias''. Simiarly, the faj\u00e3's coast is dotted by grottoes and coves, formed by marine erosion, including the ''Furna do Lobo'', a cove approximately {{convert|50|m|ft}} long and only accessible by boat.\nAmong the waterways that descend from the flanks of Norte Pequeno are the ''Ribeira da Casa Velha'' (supporting eels). the ''Grotinha do Fur\u00e3o'' and the ''Ribeira do Ilh\u00e9u'', supported by two important springs: the ''Abelheira'', situated alongside the roadway to Ouvidor, and the ''Caminho Velho'' on the otherside of the main square.\n\n===Biome===\nThe more abundant species of fish in the waters include: [[Sparisoma cretense|Mediterranean parrotfish]] (''Sparisoma cretense''), [[moray eel]], [[anchovy]], [[grouper]], [[wrasse]], in addition to [[crab]]s and [[limpet]]s.\nMarine and terrestrial birds vary throughout the year, influenced by migratory patterns and climate. In addition to local [[terns]], [[shearwater]]s and [[heron]]s, the faj\u00e3 is visited by [[wagtail]]s, [[Passer|sparrows]] and [[common blackbird]] (''Turdus merula'') throughout the year, with other species arriving in the summer months.\n\n===Human geography===\nThe faj\u00e3 is occupied by couple of dozen homes, some dating back centuries. But, less than half those homes are constantly inhabited throughout the year. The majority of the remaining homes, and new dwellings are inhabited during the summer months, when local population \"booms\" with summer tourists and visitors: there are approximately 30 families that have homes in this community.

It said rapid traffic and population growth suggested the need for both corridors in the long term, but identified the southern route as the one that would produce benefits earlier and greater over time than the northern one. It said: \"The southern corridor is likely to be a medium term solution. It accommodates future construction of the northern corridor and provides the 'real option' to defer significant investment in the northern corridor for 10 to 15 years.

The report said Treasury Department officials failed to warn the government that extending CityLink tolling could \"create an unintended monopoly advantage for Transurban\". It said  Treasury officials also failed to properly consider a range of alternative project options, or other ways\u2013apart from extending Transurban's tolling on CityLink\u2013to pay for the new road. \"The business case was not sufficiently comprehensive and so undermined one of its key purposes\u2013to provide confidence to decision-makers that they are selecting the right investment option,\" the audit said. \n\nAuditor-General Andrew Greaves argued funds to build the road could have been raised through other means. The state government could have increased taxes, borrowed the money, taken control of CityLink tolling, or opened it up to competitive tender, he said. The report said including the Monash Freeway upgrade \"lacked a convincing rationale\" and coupled with a series of other abnormal additions might have inflated the project's benefits on paper.

The report said Treasury Department officials failed to warn the government that extending CityLink tolling could \"create an unintended monopoly advantage for Transurban\". It said  Treasury officials also failed to properly consider a range of alternative project options, or other ways\u2013apart from extending Transurban's tolling on CityLink\u2013to pay for the new road. \"The business case was not sufficiently comprehensive and so undermined one of its key purposes\u2013to provide confidence to decision-makers that they are selecting the right investment option,\" the audit said. \n\nAuditor-General Andrew Greaves argued funds to build the road could have been raised through other means. The state government could have increased taxes, borrowed the money, taken control of CityLink tolling, or opened it up to competitive tender, he said. The report said including the Monash Freeway upgrade \"lacked a convincing rationale\" and coupled with a series of other abnormal additions might have inflated the project's benefits on paper.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 21st film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Nicole Perlman]], [[Meg LeFauve]], and [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Perlman and LeFauve were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranks as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and was the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved (April 21\u201328, 2019), not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->ninth-highest-grossing superhero film]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|23rd<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] overall at the time. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is scheduled for release on July 8, 2022.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also cast.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> Marvel revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had worked on the screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously worked in Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited production rewrites.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others.

''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 21st film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Nicole Perlman]], [[Meg LeFauve]], and [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Perlman and LeFauve were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranks as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and was the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved (April 21\u201328, 2019), not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->ninth-highest-grossing superhero film]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|23rd<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] overall at the time. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is scheduled for release on July 8, 2022.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

She described the friendship between Danvers and Rambeau as equal, with \"a playful competitiveness [and a] mutual respect\".<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /> Like Larson, Lynch met with active duty airmen in preparation for the role. In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also cast.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> Marvel revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had worked on the screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously worked in Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited production rewrites.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others.

''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.
