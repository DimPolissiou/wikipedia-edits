Altman is known as five-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and an enduring figure from the [[New Hollywood]] era with such directors as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Sidney Lumet]], and [[David Lynch]]. Altman was considered a \"maverick\" in making [[Cinema of the United States|films]] with a highly naturalistic but stylized  and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.\n\nHis style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a \"[[subversion|subversive]]\" twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being \"anti-Hollywood\" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity.\n\nHe preferred large [[ensemble cast]]s for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], writing about his directing style, said that Altman could \"make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman /> Altman's most famous directorial achievements include, ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H*]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), ''[[Secret Honor]]'' (1984), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001). \n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognized Altman's body of work with an [[Academy Honorary Award]]. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) have been selected for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Altman is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the [[Golden Bear]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], and the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] (the other two being [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]).\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAltman was born on February 20, 1925, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Helen (n\u00e9e Matthews), a ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendant from [[Nebraska]], and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler, who came from an upper-class family.

He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a [[tattoo]]ing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to [[RKO]] for the 1948 picture ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'', which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to [[New York City]], where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the [[Calvin Company]]. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, ''Modern Football'' (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/03/fan-uncovers-robert-altmans-first-film/1 |title=Fan uncovers Robert Altman's first film |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2012/03/13/robert-altmans-lost-classic-modern-football/ |title=Robert Altman's Lost Classic: 'Modern Football' |magazine=Forbes |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nAltman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries before being hired by a local businessman in 1956 to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on [[juvenile delinquency]]. The film, titled ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', made for $60,000, was purchased by [[United Artists]] for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen [[exploitation film]] contained the foundations of Altman's later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed ''[[The James Dean Story]]'' (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor's recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following.\n\n== Television work ==\nAltman's first forays into TV directing were on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] drama series ''[[Pulse of the City]]'' (1953\u20131954), and an episode of the 1956 western series ''[[The Sheriff of Cochise]]''. After [[Alfred Hitchcock]] saw Altman's early features ''The Delinquents'' and ''The James Dean Story'', he hired him as a director for his [[CBS]] anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful TV career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]]'', ''[[The Troubleshooters (1959 TV series)|The Troubleshooters]]'', ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Kraft Mystery Theater]]'',  ''[[Combat!]]'', as well as single episodes of several other notable series including ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (the fourth season episode [[List of Maverick episodes|\"Bolt From the Blue\"]] also written by Altman and starring [[Roger Moore]]), ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nThrough this early work on industrial films and TV series, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue. He also learned to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. Though he was frequently fired from TV projects for refusing to conform to network mandates, as well as insisting on expressing political subtexts and antiwar sentiments during the Vietnam years, Altman always was able to land new assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand \"Once Upon a Savage Night\", one of his episodes of ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', for release as a TV movie under the title ''[[Nightmare in Chicago]]''.\n\nTwo years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'', but was fired within days of the project's conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He did not direct another film until ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster.\n\n== Mainstream success ==\n\nIn 1969, Altman was offered the script for ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', an adaptation of a little-known [[Korean War]]-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, ''MASH'' was widely hailed as an immediate classic upon its 1970 release. It won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 1970 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and netted five [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was Altman's highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States. The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''MASH'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=M*A*S*H&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\nNow recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), a [[Revisionist Western]] in which the mordant songs of [[Leonard Cohen]] underscore a gritty vision of the American frontier; ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a controversial adaptation of the [[Raymond Chandler]] novel (scripted by [[Leigh Brackett]]) now ranked as a seminal influence on the [[neo-noir]] subgenre; ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by [[Nicholas Ray]] as ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949); ''[[California Split]]'' (1974), a gambling comedy-drama shot partially on location in [[Reno, Nevada]]; and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of [[country music]]. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; [[Keith Carradine]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the song \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\". Although his films were often met with divisive notices, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including [[Pauline Kael]], [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Roger Ebert]]) remained steadfastly loyal to his oeuvre throughout the decade.\n\nAudiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of ''MASH,'' he founded Lion's Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman's company is not to be confused with the current [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], a Canada/U.S. entertainment company.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |date=2000 |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970\u20131979 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23265-8 |page=97}}</ref> The films he made through his company included ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'', ''[[A Wedding]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', and ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]''.\n\n== Later career and renaissance ==\n[[File:Robert Altman - 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Altman with [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] at ''Nashville'' awards ceremony in 1976]]\nIn 1980, he directed the musical film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]''. Produced by [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]], the film was based on the comic strip / cartoon [[Popeye|of the same name]] and starred the comedian [[Robin Williams]] in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including ''3&nbsp;Women'', ''A&nbsp;Wedding'' and ''Quintet''), the production was filmed on location in [[Malta]]. It was soon beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film), and songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]] (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving [[Van Dyke Parks]] to finish the orchestrations). Although the film grossed $60&nbsp;million worldwide on a $20&nbsp;million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it failed to meet studio expectations and was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nIn 1981, the director sold Lion's Gate to producer [[Jonathan Taplin]] after his political satire ''[[Health (film)|Health]]'' (shot in early 1979 for a Christmas release) was shelved by longtime distributor [[20th Century Fox]] following tepid test and festival screenings throughout 1980. The departure of longtime Altman partisan [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] from Fox also played a decisive role in forestalling the release of the film.\n\nUnable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era because of his mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of ''Popeye'', Altman began to \"direct literate dramatic properties on shoestring budgets for stage, home video, television, and limited theatrical release,\" including the acclaimed ''[[Secret Honor]]'' and ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a critically antipodean adaptation of a play that Altman had directed on Broadway.<ref name=McGilligan>{{cite book |author=McGilligan, Patrick |title=Robert Altman: Jumping off the cliff |publisher=Macmillan |year=1989}}</ref>{{rp|page=115}}\n\nIn 1982, Altman staged a production of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' at the [[University of Michigan]], where he concurrently taught a course on his films. Shortly thereafter, he returned to film ''Secret Honor'' with students. In 2008, the University of Michigan Library acquired Altman's archive.<ref name=ManyHatsUMich>{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/altman/opera-and-the-university-of-mi |title=Altman at the University of Michigan |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |series=The many hats of Robert Altman: A life in cinema |type=online exhibit}}</ref> He also co-wrote [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 hit single \"[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1546370/nashville-director-robert-altman-dies.jhtml |title=Nashville director Robert Altman dies |date=21 November 2006 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[teen comedy]] ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1985), an abortive return to Hollywood filmmaking retrospectively characterized by the [[British Film Institute]] as \"probably Altman's least successful film\", received a belated limited commercial release in 1987 after being shelved by [[MGM]].\n\nAdapted by Altman and [[Sam Shepard]] for [[The Cannon Group]] from the latter's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated play, ''[[Fool for Love (film)|Fool for Love]]'' (1985) featured the playwright-actor alongside [[Kim Basinger]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Randy Quaid]]; it fared better than most of his films from the era, earning $900,000 domestically on a $2&nbsp;million budget and positive reviews from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Vincent Canby]]. Still, widespread popularity with audiences continued to elude him.\n\nHe continued to regain a modicum of critical favor for his television [[mockumentary]] ''[[Tanner '88]]'' (1988), a collaboration with [[Garry Trudeau]] set in the milieu of a United States presidential campaign, for which he earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].\n\nIn 1990, Altman directed ''[[Vincent & Theo]]'', a [[biopic]] about [[Vincent van Gogh]] that was intended as a television miniseries for broadcast in the United Kingdom. A theatrical version of the film was a modest success in the United States, marking a significant turning point in the director's critical resurgence.{{efn|Powerfully realized study of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his brother Theo marks a return to the mainstream arena for director Robert Altman.

Co-produced by the influential [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[BAFTA]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].\n\nAltman then directed ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by [[Raymond Carver]], which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film's large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1993 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and another Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1996, Altman directed ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'', expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter&nbsp;A |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), a large-cast, British country house [[murder mystery]], was included on many critics' lists of the ten best films of that year. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ([[Julian Fellowes]]) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nWorking with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today's [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]), and USA Films (now [[Focus Features]]), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he always wanted to make without studio interference. A [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film version]] of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio series ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' was released in June&nbsp;2006. Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on ''[[Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=19678 |title=Robert Altman has a hard body |magazine=Empire}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Altman an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Family ===\nAltman was married three times. His first wife was LaVonne Elmer. They were married from 1947 to 1949, and had a daughter, Christine. His second wife was Lotus Corelli. They were married from 1950 to 1955, and had two sons, Michael and Stephen. At fourteen, Michael wrote the lyrics to \"[[Suicide Is Painless]]\", the theme song to Altman's movie, ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''. Steven is a [[production designer]] who often worked with his father. Altman's third wife was Kathryn Reed. They were married from 1957 until his death in 2006. They had two sons, Robert and Matthew.

He understood the creative limits imposed by the television genre, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as \"[[auteur]]istic attacks\" and \"idiosyncratic variations\" of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.<ref name=Wakeman>John Wakeman, ed. ''World Film Directors \u2013 Vol. 2'', H. W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 29\u201339</ref>\n\nHis films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for \"refusing to compromise his own artistic vision.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> He has been described as \"anti-Hollywood,\" often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. However, he still felt that his independence as a filmmaker did him little harm overall:\n\n{{quote|I don't think there's a filmmaker alive, or who ever lived, who's had a better shake than I've had. I've never been without a project and it's always been a project of my own choosing. So I don't know how much better it could be. I have not become a mogul, I don't build castles and I don't have a vast personal fortune, but I have been able to do what I've wanted to do and I've done it a lot.<ref name=Stevens />}}\n\n\"Altman was a genuine movie maverick,\" states author [[Ian Freer]], because he went against the commercial conformity of the movie industry: \"He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe.\"<ref name=Freer>{{cite book |author=Freer, Ian |title=Moviemakers |publisher=Quercus |place=London, UK |year=2009 |pages=106\u2013109}}</ref> Director [[Alan Rudolph]], during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as \"Altmanesque.\"<ref name=NYT-07>{{cite news |author=Carr, David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/movies/21altman.html?_r=0 |title=A very Altmanesque tribute to Altman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nWith his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, \"I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: 'Oh, he doesn't do what you write, blah blah blah.' ... [[Ring Lardner, Jr.|Ring Lardner]] was very pissed off with me,\" for not following his script.<ref name=Thompson/>{{rp|page=18}} Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.<ref name=Armstrong/>{{rp|page=9}}\n\nHis reputation among actors is quite different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. [[Cher]], for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' (1982). \"Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. ... Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.\" Others, like [[Julianne Moore]], describes working with him:\n\n{{quote|You know, all this talk about Bob being this kind of irascible, difficult kind of person? Well, he was never that way with an actor or with a creative person that I saw. Never, never, never. He saved all that for the money people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=431}}}}\n\nHowever, director [[Robert Dornhelm]] states, Altman \"looked at film as a pure, artistic venue.\" With ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), for instance, the distributor \"begged him\" to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: \"Bob just thought the Antichrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art.\"<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|page=438}}\n\n[[Sally Kellerman]], noting Altman's willful attitude, still looks back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:\n\n{{quote|I had just finished filming ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' when Bob called me one day at home. \"Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?\" he asked. \"Only if it's a good part,\" I said. He hung up on me.<br/>\nBob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kellerman, Sally |title=Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood life |publisher=Weinstein Books |year=2013 |page=146}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Themes and subjects ===\nUnlike directors whose work fits within various [[film genre]]s, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman's work has been defined as more \"anti-genre\" by various critics.<ref name=Hillstrom/> This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]], compared the humor in his films to her father's films:\n\n{{quote|They're funny in the right way. Funny in a critical way \u2014 of what the world is and the world we live in. They were both geniuses in their way. They alter your experience of reality. They have their world and they have their humor. That humor is so rare.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|page=287}} }}\n\nAltman made it clear that he did not like \"storytelling\" in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream movies are made. According to Altman biographer [[Mitchell Zuckoff]], \"he disliked the word 'story,' believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior.\"<ref name=Zuckoff>{{cite book |author=Zuckoff, Mitchell |title=Robert Altman: The oral biography |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, NY |year=2009 |ISBN=978-0-307-26768-9}}</ref>{{rp|page=xiii}} Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman's films: \"He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=xiii}} [[Julianne Moore]], after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman's style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:\n\n{{quote|I felt it really strongly. And I thought, \"I don't know who this guy is, but that's what I want to do. I want to do that kind of work.\" From then on I'd see his films whenever I could, and he was always my absolute favorite director, for what he said thematically and emotionally and how he felt about people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=324}}}}\n\nFilm author Charles Derry writes that Altman's films \"characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly.\"<ref name=Hillstrom/> Because Altman was an astute observer of society and \"especially interested in people,\" notes Derry, many of his film characters had \"that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.\n\nFor many of Altman's films, the satirical content is evident: ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) is a satire on Westerns;<ref name=Wood>{{cite web |author=Wood, Robin |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/MASHed_marlowe_wood.pdf |title=Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism |id=2 |date=November 23, 1973}}</ref> author [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] states that ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) is a \"brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial\";<ref>{{cite news |author=Kennedy, Matthew |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/32/nashville.php#.UilBRNJJOSo |title=The Nashville Chronicles: The making of Robert Altman's masterpiece |series=book review |date=April 2001}}</ref> ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023299-wedding/ |title=A Wedding |type=film review |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Altman himself said that ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992) was \"a very mild satire\" about the Hollywood film industry, and [[Vincent Canby]] agreed, stating that \"as a satire, ''The Player'' tickles. It doesn't draw blood.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Canby, Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE5DE1538F933A25757C0A964958260 |title=The Player |type=movie review |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 10, 1992}}</ref> However, the satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:\n\n{{quote|When the picture opened, it was a big, big flop. ... I went to David Picker and said, \"You can't do this. No wonder the fucking picture is failing. It's giving the wrong impression. You make it look like a thriller and it's not, it's a satire.<ref name=Thompson/>}}\n\nSimilarly, Altman also blames the failure of ''[[O.C. & Stiggs]]'' on its being marketed as a typical \"teenage movie,\" rather than what he filmed it as, a \"satire of a teenage movie,\" he said.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Improvisation and natural dialogue ===\nAltman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a \"blueprint\" for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an \"actor's director,\" a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because \"he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration,\" notes Derry. [[Richard Baskin]] says that \"Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him.\"<ref name=Hillstrom />\n\n<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=282}} [[Geraldine Chaplin]], who acted in ''Nashville'', recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:\n\n{{quote|He said, \"Have you brought your scripts?\" We said yes. He said, \"Well, throw them away. You don't need them. You need to know who you are and where you are and who you're with.\" ... It was like being onstage with a full house every second. All the circus acts you had inside your body you'd do just for him.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=282}}}}\n\nAltman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming.<ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book |editor=Armstrong, Rick |title=Robert Altman: Critical essays |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |pages=12, 21}}</ref> Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of movie production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sterritt, David |title=Screening the Beats: Media culture and the beat sensibility |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=2004 |page=70}}</ref> Altman said that \"once we start shooting it's a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don't just turn people loose.\"<ref name=Stevens>{{cite book |author=Stevens, George Jr. |title=Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |pages=3\u201316}}</ref> Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor's every move, preferring to let them be in control:\n\n{{quote|When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give them encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work. ... All I'm trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist. ... I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative. ... I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create.<ref name=Stevens/>}}\n\n[[Carol Burnett]] remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. \"You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing,\" she said.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=328}} Others, such as [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], became creatively driven:\n\n{{quote|He would inspire you out of sheer necessity to come up with stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and so damn funny.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=435}}}}\n\nHe liked working with many of the same performers for other films, including [[Elliott Gould]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors \"who flourish as improvisers,\" such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, ''MASH'', ''The Long Goodbye'' and ''California Split''.<ref name=Armstrong /> Gould recalls that when filming ''MASH'', his first acting job with Altman, he and costar [[Donald Sutherland]] didn't think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, \"I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius.\"<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=174}} Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] explains:\n\n{{quote|We thought that's the way movies were. That they were that joyous an experience. If you had any kind of career, you quickly saw that most directors don't really trust actors, don't really want to see actors acting. That was the difference with Bob Altman. He loved actors and wanted to see acting.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=175}}}}\n\nUnlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided \"conventional storytelling,\" and would opt for showing the \"busy confusion of real life,\" observes Albert Lindauer.<ref name=Wakeman/> Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include \"a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, ... and a reliance on improvisation.\"<ref name=Wakeman/> A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:\n\n{{quote|I equate this work more with painting than with theater or literature. Stories don't interest me. Basically, I'm more interested in behavior. I don't direct, I watch. I have to be thrilled if I expect the audience to be thrilled. Because what I really want to see from an actor is something I've never seen before, so I can't tell them what it is. I try to encourage actors not to take turns. To deal with conversation as conversation. I mean, that's what the job is, I think. It's to make a comfort area so that an actor can go beyond what he thought he could do.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|page=8}}}}\n\n[[Patricia Resnick]] often wrote his screenplays.\n\n=== Realistic sound and large ensemble casts ===\nAltman was one of the few filmmakers who \"paid full attention to the possibilities of sound\" when filming.<ref name=Freer /> He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks.<ref name=Freer /> During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a \"dense audio experience\" for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, \"I like to see a lot of stuff going on.\"<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nAltman first used overlapping soundtracks in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as \"a breathtaking innovation at the time.\"<ref name=Barson>{{cite book |author=Barson, Michael |title=The Illustrated Who's-Who of Hollywood Directors |publisher=Noonday Press |year=1995 |pages=12\u201315}}</ref> He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.<ref name=Wakeman/> According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), also considered among his finest films.<ref name=Hillstrom>{{cite book |editor=Hillstrom, Laurie Collier |title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers |volume=2 |publisher=St. James Press |year=1997 |pages=12\u201317}}</ref>\n\nHowever, overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman's films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics, however, changed their mind after seeing them again. British film critic, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], gave ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, \"But going back to ''Nashville'' and some of the earlier films, ... made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful ''Nashville'' is. ... The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that [[Jean Renoir|Renoir]] might have admired.\"<ref name=Thomson>{{cite book |author=Thomson, David |title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |place=New York, N.Y. |year=2002 |pages=13\u201314}}</ref> During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star [[Ronee Blakley]] was convinced of the film's ultimate success:\n\n{{quote|Yes, I did think it was going to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was intensely competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 \"Ronee Blakley Reflects About Robert Altman's epic film 'Nashville'\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054947/http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 |date=November 17, 2013 }}, ''Indiewire'', Nov. 3, 2013</ref>}}\n\nThomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman's style, beginning with ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970): \"''MASH'' began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes ''Nashville'' so absorbing.\"<ref name=Thomson/> Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: \"If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking.\"<ref name=Stevens/> [[Pauline Kael]] writes that Altman, \"the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that ... he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman/>\n\n=== Photography ===\nAltman's distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'', he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters.<ref name=Frost>{{cite book |author=Frost, Jacqueline B. |title=Cinematography for Directors: A guide for creative collaboration |publisher=Michael Wiese Productions |year=2009 |pages=46, 221}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] told Altman that \"the camerawork was wonderful,\" and asked, \"How did you do it?\"<ref name=Rogers/>\n\nIn ''Nashville'', Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For ''The Long Goodbye'', he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects.<ref name=Hillstrom/> Zsigmond states that Altman \"wanted to do something different\" in this film, and told him he \"wanted the camera to move \u2014 all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side.\"<ref name=Rogers/> Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, \"I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along \u2013 quite a nice way of working.\"<ref name=Frost/>\n\nZsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:\n\n{{quote|We rather enjoyed doing things \"improv.\" Altman is a great improviser. During the first few days of the shoot, he would \"create\" different approaches on a moment's notice. He would show me how he wanted the camera to move \u2014 always move. Which was fun. The actors loved it, and I was always challenged to find ways to shoot what Altman came up with.<ref name=Rogers>{{cite book |author=Rogers, Pauline S. |title=More Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art |publisher=Focal Press |year=2000 |pages=178\u2013179}}</ref>}}\n\nVilmos Zsigmond's cinematography in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' received a nomination by the [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n=== Music scores ===\nWhen using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked. Director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], who worked with him, notes that \"Altman's use of music is always important,\" adding, \"Bob loved his music, didn't he? My God, he loved his music\".<ref name=Armstrong/> Since he was a \"great fan\" of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s music, for example, saying he would \"just get stoned and play that stuff\" all the time<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |editor=Thompson, David |title=Altman on Altman |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=2010 |edition=ebook}}</ref> he used three of his songs in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and another for the final scene in ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite book |author=Simmons, Sylvie |title=I'm Your Man: The life of Leonard Cohen |publisher=Random House |year=2012 |at=Chapter&nbsp;13}}</ref>\n\nFor ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), Altman had numerous new country music songs written by his cast to create a realistic atmosphere. He incorporated a \"hauntingly repeated melody\" in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), and employed [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]] to score ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980).<ref name=McGilligan/>{{rp|page=347}}\n\nA number of music experts have written about Altman's use of music, including Richard R.

Altman''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0254\u02d0|l|t|m|\u0259|n}}; February 20, 1925 \u2013 November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Altman is known as five-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and an enduring figure from the [[New Hollywood]] era with such directors as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Sidney Lumet]], and [[David Lynch]]. Altman was considered a \"maverick\" in making [[Cinema of the United States|films]] with a highly naturalistic but stylized  and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema.\n\nHis style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a \"[[subversion|subversive]]\" twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being \"anti-Hollywood\" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity.\n\nHe preferred large [[ensemble cast]]s for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], writing about his directing style, said that Altman could \"make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman /> Altman's most famous directorial achievements include, ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H*]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), ''[[Secret Honor]]'' (1984), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001). \n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognized Altman's body of work with an [[Academy Honorary Award]]. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) have been selected for the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Altman is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the [[Golden Bear]] at [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], and the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] (the other two being [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]).\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAltman was born on February 20, 1925, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Helen (n\u00e9e Matthews), a ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendant from [[Nebraska]], and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler, who came from an upper-class family. Altman's ancestry was German, English and Irish;<ref name=\"altman3\">{{cite news |last=Lemons |first=Stephen |title=Robert Altman |page=2 |work=Salon.com |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208024334/http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"altman1\">{{cite news |last=The Daily Telegraph |title=Robert Altman, 81, Mercurial Director of Masterworks and Flops |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=November 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/44018 |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref> his paternal grandfather, Frank Altman, Sr., anglicized the spelling of the family name from \"Altmann\" to \"Altman\".<ref name=\"altman1\" /> Altman had a Catholic upbringing,<ref name=\"altman2\">{{cite web |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Altman |publisher=Adherents.com |date=July 28, 2005 |url =http://www.adherents.com/people/pa/Robert_Altman.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref> but he did not continue to follow or practice the religion as an adult,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/01/features.weekend \"Interview: Robert Altman\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> although he has been referred to as \"a sort of Catholic\" and a Catholic director.<ref name=\"altman2\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholichistory.net/Spotlights/SpotlightMovies.htm |title=Spotlight: Catholics at the Movies |publisher=Catholichistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> He was educated at [[Jesuit]] schools, including [[Rockhurst High School]], in Kansas City.<ref>{{cite news |author=Butler, Robert W. |date=March 5, 2006 |title=Finally, An Attitude Adjustment: Hollywood's Establishment Now Embraces Rebel Director Altman |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]] |page=5 }}</ref> He graduated from [[Wentworth Military Academy]] in [[Lexington, Missouri]] in 1943.\n\nIn 1943, Altman joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] at the age of 18. During [[World War II]], Altman flew more than 50 bombing missions as a crewman on a [[B-24 Liberator]] with the 307th Bomb Group in [[Borneo]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"altm\">{{cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.b24bestweb.com/b24bestweb-Famous.htm|title = Famous B-24/PB4Y Crew Members |publisher=B-24 Best Web |accessdate=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nUpon his discharge in 1946, Altman moved to California. He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a [[tattoo]]ing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to [[RKO]] for the 1948 picture ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'', which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to [[New York City]], where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the [[Calvin Company]]. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, ''Modern Football'' (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/03/fan-uncovers-robert-altmans-first-film/1 |title=Fan uncovers Robert Altman's first film |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2012/03/13/robert-altmans-lost-classic-modern-football/ |title=Robert Altman's Lost Classic: 'Modern Football' |magazine=Forbes |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nAltman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries before being hired by a local businessman in 1956 to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on [[juvenile delinquency]]. The film, titled ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', made for $60,000, was purchased by [[United Artists]] for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen [[exploitation film]] contained the foundations of Altman's later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed ''[[The James Dean Story]]'' (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor's recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following.\n\n== Television work ==\nAltman's first forays into TV directing were on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] drama series ''[[Pulse of the City]]'' (1953\u20131954), and an episode of the 1956 western series ''[[The Sheriff of Cochise]]''. After [[Alfred Hitchcock]] saw Altman's early features ''The Delinquents'' and ''The James Dean Story'', he hired him as a director for his [[CBS]] anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful TV career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]]'', ''[[The Troubleshooters (1959 TV series)|The Troubleshooters]]'', ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Kraft Mystery Theater]]'',  ''[[Combat!]]'', as well as single episodes of several other notable series including ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (the fourth season episode [[List of Maverick episodes|\"Bolt From the Blue\"]] also written by Altman and starring [[Roger Moore]]), ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]]'', and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nThrough this early work on industrial films and TV series, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue. He also learned to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. Though he was frequently fired from TV projects for refusing to conform to network mandates, as well as insisting on expressing political subtexts and antiwar sentiments during the Vietnam years, Altman always was able to land new assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand \"Once Upon a Savage Night\", one of his episodes of ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', for release as a TV movie under the title ''[[Nightmare in Chicago]]''.\n\nTwo years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'', but was fired within days of the project's conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He did not direct another film until ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster.\n\n== Mainstream success ==\n\nIn 1969, Altman was offered the script for ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', an adaptation of a little-known [[Korean War]]-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, ''MASH'' was widely hailed as an immediate classic upon its 1970 release. It won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 1970 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and netted five [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was Altman's highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States. The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''MASH'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=M*A*S*H&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\nNow recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), a [[Revisionist Western]] in which the mordant songs of [[Leonard Cohen]] underscore a gritty vision of the American frontier; ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a controversial adaptation of the [[Raymond Chandler]] novel (scripted by [[Leigh Brackett]]) now ranked as a seminal influence on the [[neo-noir]] subgenre; ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by [[Nicholas Ray]] as ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949); ''[[California Split]]'' (1974), a gambling comedy-drama shot partially on location in [[Reno, Nevada]]; and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of [[country music]]. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; [[Keith Carradine]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the song \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\". Although his films were often met with divisive notices, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including [[Pauline Kael]], [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Roger Ebert]]) remained steadfastly loyal to his oeuvre throughout the decade.\n\nAudiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of ''MASH,'' he founded Lion's Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman's company is not to be confused with the current [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], a Canada/U.S. entertainment company.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |date=2000 |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970\u20131979 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23265-8 |page=97}}</ref> The films he made through his company included ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'', ''[[A Wedding]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', and ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]''.\n\n== Later career and renaissance ==\n[[File:Robert Altman - 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Altman with [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] at ''Nashville'' awards ceremony in 1976]]\nIn 1980, he directed the musical film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]''. Produced by [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]], the film was based on the comic strip / cartoon [[Popeye|of the same name]] and starred the comedian [[Robin Williams]] in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including ''3&nbsp;Women'', ''A&nbsp;Wedding'' and ''Quintet''), the production was filmed on location in [[Malta]]. It was soon beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film), and songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]] (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving [[Van Dyke Parks]] to finish the orchestrations). Although the film grossed $60&nbsp;million worldwide on a $20&nbsp;million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it failed to meet studio expectations and was considered a box office disappointment.\n\nIn 1981, the director sold Lion's Gate to producer [[Jonathan Taplin]] after his political satire ''[[Health (film)|Health]]'' (shot in early 1979 for a Christmas release) was shelved by longtime distributor [[20th Century Fox]] following tepid test and festival screenings throughout 1980. The departure of longtime Altman partisan [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] from Fox also played a decisive role in forestalling the release of the film.\n\nUnable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era because of his mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of ''Popeye'', Altman began to \"direct literate dramatic properties on shoestring budgets for stage, home video, television, and limited theatrical release,\" including the acclaimed ''[[Secret Honor]]'' and ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a critically antipodean adaptation of a play that Altman had directed on Broadway.<ref name=McGilligan>{{cite book |author=McGilligan, Patrick |title=Robert Altman: Jumping off the cliff |publisher=Macmillan |year=1989}}</ref>{{rp|115}}\n\nIn 1982, Altman staged a production of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' at the [[University of Michigan]], where he concurrently taught a course on his films. Shortly thereafter, he returned to film ''Secret Honor'' with students. In 2008, the University of Michigan Library acquired Altman's archive.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/altman/opera-and-the-university-of-mi |title=Altman at the University of Michigan |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |series=The many hats of Robert Altman: A life in cinema |type=online exhibit}}</ref> He also co-wrote [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 hit single \"[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1546370/nashville-director-robert-altman-dies.jhtml |title=Nashville director Robert Altman dies |date=21 November 2006 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[teen comedy]] ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1985), an abortive return to Hollywood filmmaking retrospectively characterized by the [[British Film Institute]] as \"probably Altman's least successful film\", received a belated limited commercial release in 1987 after being shelved by [[MGM]].\n\nAdapted by Altman and [[Sam Shepard]] for [[The Cannon Group]] from the latter's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-nominated play, ''[[Fool for Love (film)|Fool for Love]]'' (1985) featured the playwright-actor alongside [[Kim Basinger]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Randy Quaid]]; it fared better than most of his films from the era, earning $900,000 domestically on a $2&nbsp;million budget and positive reviews from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Vincent Canby]]. Still, widespread popularity with audiences continued to elude him.\n\nHe continued to regain a modicum of critical favor for his television [[mockumentary]] ''[[Tanner '88]]'' (1988), a collaboration with [[Garry Trudeau]] set in the milieu of a United States presidential campaign, for which he earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].\n\nIn 1990, Altman directed ''[[Vincent & Theo]]'', a [[biopic]] about [[Vincent van Gogh]] that was intended as a television miniseries for broadcast in the United Kingdom. A theatrical version of the film was a modest success in the United States, marking a significant turning point in the director's critical resurgence.{{efn|Powerfully realized study of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his brother Theo marks a return to the mainstream arena for director Robert Altman.

Co-produced by the influential [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[BAFTA]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].\n\nAltman then directed ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by [[Raymond Carver]], which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film's large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1993 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and another Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1996, Altman directed ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'', expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter&nbsp;A |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), a large-cast, British country house [[murder mystery]], was included on many critics' lists of the ten best films of that year. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ([[Julian Fellowes]]) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nWorking with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today's [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]), and USA Films (now [[Focus Features]]), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he always wanted to make without studio interference. A [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film version]] of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio series ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' was released in June&nbsp;2006. Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on ''[[Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=19678 |title=Robert Altman has a hard body |magazine=Empire}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Altman an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Family ===\nAltman was married three times. His first wife was LaVonne Elmer. They were married from 1947 to 1949, and had a daughter, Christine. His second wife was Lotus Corelli. They were married from 1950 to 1955, and had two sons, Michael and Stephen. At fourteen, Michael wrote the lyrics to \"[[Suicide Is Painless]]\", the theme song to Altman's movie, ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''. Steven is a [[production designer]] who often worked with his father. Altman's third wife was Kathryn Reed. They were married from 1957 until his death in 2006. They had two sons, Robert and Matthew.

He moved his family and business headquarters to New York City, but eventually moved back to Malibu, where he lived until his death. Altman despised the television series ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' which followed his 1970 film, citing it as being the antithesis of what his movie was about, and citing its anti-war messages as being \"racist\". In the 2001 DVD commentary for ''MASH'', he stated clearly the reasons for which he disapproved of the series.{{clarify|and what were they?|date=September 2019}}{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Political views ===\nIn November 2000, he claimed that he would move to Paris if [[George W.

He understood the creative limits imposed by the television genre, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as \"[[auteur]]istic attacks\" and \"idiosyncratic variations\" of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.<ref name=Wakeman>John Wakeman, ed. ''World Film Directors \u2013 Vol. 2'', H. W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 29\u201339</ref>\n\nHis films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for \"refusing to compromise his own artistic vision.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> He has been described as \"anti-Hollywood,\" often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. However, he still felt that his independence as a filmmaker did him little harm overall:\n\n{{quote|I don't think there's a filmmaker alive, or who ever lived, who's had a better shake than I've had. I've never been without a project and it's always been a project of my own choosing. So I don't know how much better it could be. I have not become a mogul, I don't build castles and I don't have a vast personal fortune, but I have been able to do what I've wanted to do and I've done it a lot.<ref name=Stevens />}}\n\n\"Altman was a genuine movie maverick,\" states author [[Ian Freer]], because he went against the commercial conformity of the movie industry: \"He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe.\"<ref name=Freer>Freer, Ian. ''Moviemakers'', Quercus, London, (2009) pp. 106\u2013109. No online access.</ref> Director [[Alan Rudolph]], during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as \"Altmanesque.\"<ref name=NYT-07>Carr, David. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/movies/21altman.html?_r=0 \"A Very Altmanesque Tribute to Altman\"], ''New York Times'', February 21, 2007</ref>\n\nWith his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, \"I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: 'Oh, he doesn't do what you write, blah blah blah.' . . . . [[Ring Lardner, Jr.|Ring Lardner]] was very pissed off with me,\" for not following his script.<ref name=Thompson />{{rp|18}} Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.<ref name=Armstrong />{{rp|9}}\n\nHis reputation among actors is quite different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. [[Cher]], for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' (1982). \"Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. . . . Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.\" Others, like [[Julianne Moore]], describes working with him:\n\n{{quote|You know, all this talk about Bob being this kind of irascible, difficult kind of person? Well, he was never that way with an actor or with a creative person that I saw. Never, never, never. He saved all that for the money people.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|431}}}}\n\nHowever, director [[Robert Dornhelm]] states, Altman \"looked at film as a pure, artistic venue.\" With ''[[Short Cuts (film)|Short Cuts]]'' (1993), for instance, the distributor \"begged him\" to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: \"Bob just thought the Antichrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art.\"<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|438}}\n\n[[Sally Kellerman]], noting Altman's willful attitude, still looks back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:\n\n{{quote|I had just finished filming ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' when Bob called me one day at home. \"Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?\" he asked. \"Only if it's a good part,\" I said. He hung up on me.<br />\nBob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.<ref>Kellerman, Sally. ''Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood Life'', Weinstein Books (2013) p. 146</ref>}}\n\n=== Themes and subjects ===\nUnlike directors whose work fits within various [[film genre]]s, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman's work has been defined as more \"anti-genre\" by various critics.<ref name=Hillstrom /> This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]], compared the humor in his films to her father's films:\n\n{{quote|They're funny in the right way. Funny in a critical way\u2014of what the world is and the world we live in. They were both geniuses in their way. They alter your experience of reality. They have their world and they have their humor. That humor is so rare.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|287}}}}\n\nAltman made it clear that he did not like \"storytelling\" in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream movies are made. According to Altman biographer [[Mitchell Zuckoff]], \"he disliked the word 'story,' believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior.\"<ref name=Zuckoff>Zuckoff, Mitchell. ''Robert Altman: the Oral Biography'', Alfred A. Knopf (2009)</ref>{{rp|xiii}} Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman's films: \"He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|xiii}} [[Julianne Moore]], after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman's style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:\n\n{{quote|I felt it really strongly. And I thought, \"I don't know who this guy is, but that's what I want to do. I want to do that kind of work.\" From then on I'd see his films whenever I could, and he was always my absolute favorite director, for what he said thematically and emotionally and how he felt about people.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|324}}}}\n\nFilm author Charles Derry writes that Altman's films \"characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> Because Altman was an astute observer of society and \"especially interested in people,\" notes Derry, many of his film characters had \"that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived.\"<ref name=Hillstrom /> As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.\n\nFor many of Altman's films, the satirical content is evident: ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) is a satire on Westerns;<ref name=Wood>Wood, Robin. [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/MASHed_marlowe_wood.pdf ''Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism''] 2, November 23, 1973</ref> author [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] states that ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) is a \"brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial\";<ref>Kennedy, Matthew. [http://brightlightsfilm.com/32/nashville.php#.UilBRNJJOSo ''The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece''], book review, April 2001</ref> ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy;<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023299-wedding/ ''A Wedding''], review by Rotten Tomatoes;</ref> Altman himself said that ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992) was \"a very mild satire\" about the Hollywood film industry, and [[Vincent Canby]] agreed, stating that \"as a satire, ''The Player'' tickles. It doesn't draw blood.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE5DE1538F933A25757C0A964958260 \"The Player\" movie review], ''New York Times'', April 10, 1992</ref> However, the satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:\n\n{{quote|When the picture opened, it was a big, big flop. . . I went to David Picker and said, \"You can't do this. No wonder the fucking picture is failing. It's giving the wrong impression. You make it look like a thriller and it's not, it's a satire.<ref name=Thompson />}}\n\nSimilarly, Altman also blames the failure of ''[[O.C. & Stiggs]]'' on its being marketed as a typical \"teenage movie,\" rather than what he filmed it as, a \"satire of a teenage movie,\" he said.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Improvisation and natural dialogue ===\nAltman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a \"blueprint\" for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an \"actor's director,\" a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because \"he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration,\" notes Derry. [[Richard Baskin]] says that \"Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him.\"<ref name=Hillstrom />\n\n<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|282}} [[Geraldine Chaplin]], who acted in ''Nashville'', recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:\n\n{{quote|He said, \"Have you brought your scripts?\" We said yes. He said, \"Well, throw them away. You don't need them. You need to know who you are and where you are and who you're with.\" . . . It was like being onstage with a full house every second. All the circus acts you had inside your body you'd do just for him.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|282}}}}\n\nAltman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming.<ref name=Armstrong>Armstrong, Rick, editor, ''Robert Altman: Critical Essays'', McFarland (2011) pp. 12, 21</ref> Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of movie production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character.<ref>Sterritt, David. ''Screening the Beats: Media Culture and the Beat Sensibility'', Southern Illinois University Press (2004) p. 70</ref> Altman said that \"once we start shooting it's a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don't just turn people loose.\"<ref name=Stevens>Stevens, George Jr. ''Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers'', Random House (2012) pp. 3\u201316</ref> Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor's every move, preferring to let them be in control:\n\n{{quote|When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give them encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work. . . . All I'm trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist. . . . I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative. . . . I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create.<ref name=Stevens />}}\n\n[[Carol Burnett]] remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. \"You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing,\" she said.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|328}} Others, such as [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], became creatively driven:\n\n{{quote|He would inspire you out of sheer necessity to come up with stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and so damn funny.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|435}}}}\n\nHe liked working with many of the same performers for other films, including [[Elliott Gould]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors \"who flourish as improvisers,\" such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, ''MASH'', ''The Long Goodbye'' and ''California Split''.<ref name=Armstrong /> Gould recalls that when filming ''MASH'', his first acting job with Altman, he and costar [[Donald Sutherland]] didn't think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, \"I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius.\"<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|174}} Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] explains:\n\n{{quote|We thought that's the way movies were. That they were that joyous an experience. If you had any kind of career, you quickly saw that most directors don't really trust actors, don't really want to see actors acting. That was the difference with Bob Altman. He loved actors and wanted to see acting.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|175}}}}\n\nUnlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided \"conventional storytelling,\" and would opt for showing the \"busy confusion of real life,\" observes Albert Lindauer.<ref name=Wakeman /> Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include \"a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, . . . and a reliance on improvisation.\"<ref name=Wakeman /> A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:\n\n{{quote|I equate this work more with painting than with theater or literature. Stories don't interest me. Basically, I'm more interested in behavior. I don't direct, I watch. I have to be thrilled if I expect the audience to be thrilled. Because what I really want to see from an actor is something I've never seen before, so I can't tell them what it is. I try to encourage actors not to take turns. To deal with conversation as conversation. I mean, that's what the job is, I think. It's to make a comfort area so that an actor can go beyond what he thought he could do.<ref name=Zuckoff />{{rp|8}}}}\n\n[[Patricia Resnick]] often wrote his screenplays.\n\n=== Realistic sound and large ensemble casts ===\nAltman was one of the few filmmakers who \"paid full attention to the possibilities of sound\" when filming.<ref name=Freer /> He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks.<ref name=Freer /> During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a \"dense audio experience\" for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, \"I like to see a lot of stuff going on.\"<ref name=Stevens />\n\nAltman first used overlapping soundtracks in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as \"a breathtaking innovation at the time.\"<ref name=Barson>Barson, Michael. ''The Illustrated Who's Who of Hollywood Directors'', Noonday Press (1995) pp.12\u201315</ref> He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.<ref name=Wakeman /> According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), also considered among his finest films.<ref name=Hillstrom>Hillstrom, Laurie Collier. ed. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers \u2013 vol. 2'', St. James Press (1997) pp. 12\u201317</ref>\n\nHowever, overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman's films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics, however, changed their mind after seeing them again. British film critic, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], gave ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, \"But going back to ''Nashville'' and some of the earlier films, . . . made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful ''Nashville'' is. . . . The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that [[Jean Renoir|Renoir]] might have admired.\"<ref name=Thomson>Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film'', Alfred A. Knopf, N.Y. (2002) pp. 13\u201314</ref> During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star [[Ronee Blakley]] was convinced of the film's ultimate success:\n\n{{quote|Yes, I did think it was going to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was intensely competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 \"Ronee Blakley Reflects About Robert Altman's epic film 'Nashville'\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054947/http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 |date=November 17, 2013 }}, ''Indiewire'', Nov. 3, 2013</ref>}}\n\nThomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman's style, beginning with ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970): \"''MASH'' began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes ''Nashville'' so absorbing.\"<ref name=Thomson /> Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: \"If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking.\"<ref name=Stevens /> [[Pauline Kael]] writes that Altman, \"the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that . . . he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing.\"<ref name=Wakeman />\n\n=== Photography ===\nAltman's distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'', he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters.<ref name=Frost>Frost, Jacqueline B. ''Cinematography for Directors: A Guide for Creative Collaboration'', Michael Wiese Productions (2009) pp. 46, 221</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] told Altman that \"the camerawork was wonderful,\" and asked, \"How did you do it?\"<ref name=Rogers />\n\nIn ''Nashville'', Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For ''The Long Goodbye'', he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects.<ref name=Hillstrom /> Zsigmond states that Altman \"wanted to do something different\" in this film, and told him he \"wanted the camera to move\u2014all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side.\"<ref name=Rogers /> Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, \"I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along \u2013 quite a nice way of working.\"<ref name=Frost />\n\nZsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:\n\n{{quote|We rather enjoyed doing things \"improv.\" Altman is a great improviser. During the first few days of the shoot, he would \"create\" different approaches on a moment's notice. He would show me how he wanted the camera to move\u2014always move. Which was fun. The actors loved it, and I was always challenged to find ways to shoot what Altman came up with.<ref name=Rogers>Rogers, Pauline S. ''More Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art'', Focal Press (2000) pp. 178\u2013179</ref>}}\n\nVilmos Zsigmond's cinematography in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' received a nomination by the [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n=== Music scores ===\nWhen using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked. Director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], who worked with him, notes that \"Altman's use of music is always important,\" adding, \"Bob loved his music, didn't he?

They are also known to cause ribosomal aggregation and delocalize membrane proteins.\n\nAdding a further layer of complexity, many natural antimicrobial peptides possess weak bactericidal activity.

In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the [[zwitterion]]ic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.\n\nIn contrast, the outer part of the membranes of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges since most of the lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes.<ref name=\"Hancock_2006\"/> Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[sphingomyelin]], even though a small portion of the membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged [[gangliosides]]. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding.<ref name = \"Tennessen_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tennessen JA | title = Molecular evolution of animal antimicrobial peptides: widespread moderate positive selection | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1387\u201394 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16313451 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00925.x }}</ref> However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Dual polarisation interferometry]] has been used ''in vitro'' to study and quantify the association to headgroup, insertion into the bilayer, pore formation and eventual disruption of the membrane.<ref name = \"Yu_2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu L, Guo L, Ding JL, Ho B, Feng SS, Popplewell J, Swann M, Wohland T | title = Interaction of an artificial antimicrobial peptide with lipid membranes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes| volume = 1788 | issue = 2 | pages = 333\u201344 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19013127 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.10.005 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid19400207\">{{cite book | vauthors = Lee TH, Hall K, Mechler A, Martin L, Popplewell J, Ronan G, Aguilar MI | title = Molecular imaging and orientational changes of antimicrobial peptides in membranes | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 611 | issue = | pages = 313\u20135 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19400207 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-73657-0_140 | isbn = 978-0-387-73656-3 | bibcode = 2009peyo.book..313L }}</ref>\n\n===Control===\nA lot of effort has been put into controlling cell selectivity.

Once inside the membrane, they are believed to cause disruption through three possible [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]]:\n\n* toroidal pore formation\n* carpet formation\n* barrel stave formation\n\nAlthough the specifics of each mechanism differ, all propose peptide-induced membrane rupture, allowing cytoplasmic leakage that ultimately leads to death.\n\nRecent work has painted a more complex picture of antimicrobial peptide activity. Antimicrobial peptides may also function as metabolic inhibitors, inhibitors of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibitors of cell wall synthesis or septum formation.

Therefore, the outmost leaflets of the bilayer which is exposed to the outside of the bacterial membranes are more attractive to the attack of the positively charged antimicrobial peptides. So the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the [[zwitterion]]ic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.\n\nIn contrast, the outer part of the membranes of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges since most of the lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes.<ref name=\"Hancock_2006\"/> Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[sphingomyelin]], even though a small portion of the membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged [[gangliosides]].

The effect that different types of inactivation have on bacterial structure and components as well as the maintenance of probiotic properties requires further research.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nThe mechanisms of action for postbiotics is less understood, though the possible mechanisms include [[Immunomodulation|immune system regulation]] and interference with pathogen attachment to host cells. Limited research hypothesises that immobilised postbiotics release key bacterial components, such as lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, or exopolysaccharides which exhibit key immunomodulating effects and antagonising properties against pathogens.<ref name=\"Pique\" />\n\n== General postbiotics applications ==\nAs postbiotics are newly emerging, so is the evidence to support the use of postbiotics.

The [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] receive an anonymous tip and arrest Farroukh Erdogan, a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrant, as the terror cell leader and mastermind of the attack. Two other members of the cell die in the bombing and the fourth is killed by police in a shoot-out during the raid to apprehend him. When Erdogan's [[Barristers in England and Wales|Defense Barrister]] commits suicide, Martin Rose is appointed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] to replace him, joining [[Special Advocate]] Claudia Simmons-Howe. Due to national security concerns, Erdogan's case follows [[Justice and Security Act 2013|closed material procedures]]; Claudia represents Erdogan during closed sessions with a judge ruling what evidence is permissible for Martin to use in the open public trial.

The [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] receive an anonymous tip and arrest Farroukh Erdogan, a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrant, as the terror cell leader and mastermind of the attack. Two other members of the cell die in the bombing and the fourth is killed by police in a shoot-out during the raid to apprehend him. When Erdogan's [[Barristers in England and Wales|Defense Barrister]] commits suicide, Martin Rose is appointed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] to replace him, joining [[Special Advocate]] Claudia Simmons-Howe. Due to national security concerns, Erdogan's case follows [[Justice and Security Act 2013|closed material procedures]]; Claudia represents Erdogan during closed sessions with a judge ruling what evidence is permissible for Martin to use in the open public trial. [[MI5]] Agent Nazrul Sharma is assigned to provide Claudia with the closed material and monitor her activities.\n\nMartin discovers that despite his extensive criminal record, Erdogan was somehow quickly approved for immigration from his previous residence in [[Germany]] to England and within six months was living well beyond his income.
