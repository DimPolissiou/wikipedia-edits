The idea for the project came from ECM president [[Manfred Eicher]].<ref name=\"zwerin\" />\n\nSta\u0144ko lost his natural teeth in the 1990s, although over time he developed a new [[embouchure]] with the help of a skilled dentist and monotonous practice.

This experience led to a second album of Sta\u0144ko's  Polish quartet ''[[Suspended Night]]''. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine noted that this album was one of the bestselling jazz albums of 2004 in the United States. Together with ''Suspended Night'' [[ECM Records|ECM]] released a collection of Sta\u0144ko's recording in its Rarum/ Selected Recordings series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecmrecords.com/catalogue|title=ECM Records|first=ECM|last=Records|website=ECM Records|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the quartet recorded the last joint album ''[[Lontano (album)|Lontano]]'', again for ECM. Having an established position on the world jazz stage, each album of the quartet as celebrated across Europe and the United States. In 2005 the band also made its first tour around Asia and Australia. In 2005 Stanko also created music for the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] titled ''Freedom in August.''<ref>[http://www.tomaszstanko.com/records/freedom-in-august/]</ref>\n\nThe second half of the first decade 2000 saw a new resurgence in Sta\u0144ko's career: a chapter of experiments, creating projects, searching for new sounds. As a result of these experiences, in 2007 a new band, a Scandinavian quintet composed of [[Alexi Tuomarila]], [[Jakob Bro]], Anders Christensen and [[Olavi Louhivuori]], was formed, with which Sta\u0144ko recorded the 2009 album ''Dark Eyes'' for ECM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomaszstanko.com/records/dark-eyes/|title=Dark Eyes - Tomasz Sta\u0144ko|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nThe end of the first decade of the 21st century marked the beginning of the [[New York City|New York]] period in  Sta\u0144ko's life. His move to [[Manhattan]] saw him give regular concerts in New York venues and clubs, such as [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland]], [[Jazz Standard]] and [[Merkin Concert Hall|Merking Hall]]. Sta\u0144ko used the opportunity to meet with local musicians and absorbed new ideas and richness of sounds. New projects were spontaneously created, including those with [[Lee Konitz]], [[Craig Taborn]], [[Thomas Morgan (bassist)|Thomas Morgan]], [[Gerald Cleaver (musician)|Gerald Cleaver]], [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]] and others. The idea of the New York Quartet was forming which, after various combinations, eventually formed in 2012.\n\n[[File:TomaszStanko20101121.jpg|thumb|280px|Performing at the \"Szakala Day\" charity concert in Warsaw, November 2010]]\nSta\u0144ko's autobiography ''Desperado'' was published in Poland in 2010, a multi-part interview conducted by [[:pl:Rafa\u0142 Ksi\u0119\u017cyk|Rafa\u0142 Ksi\u0119\u017cyk]].<ref name=forum>{{cite web |url=http://jazzforum.com.pl/main/artykul/tomasz-stako-rafa-ksiyk-desperado |title=TOMASZ STA\u0143KO, RAFA\u0141 KSI\u0118\u017bYK: Desperado - Jazz Forum|website=jazzforum.com.pl|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=znak>{{cite web|url=https://www.znak.com.pl/kartoteka,ksiazka,12770,Desperado-Autobiografia|title=Desperado!

Its beginnings date back to 2009 when [[:pl:Jerzy Illg|Jerzy Ilg]], editor-in-chief of [[Znak (publisher)|Znak Publishing House]], invited the trumpeter to one of the last poetry nights of [[Wis\u0142awa Szymborska]]. During the meeting at the [[Opera Krakowska|Krak\u00f3w Opera]], the poet read her poems, with Sta\u0144ko accompanying her on the trumpet. The CD recording from this concert was incorporated with ''Here'', the next volume of poems published by Szymborska. Meeting the poet became the key to a new stage in Sta\u0144ko's career and some of her poems provided the inspiration for new compositions and titles. He dedicated to her his album ''[[Wis\u0142awa (album)|Wis\u0142awa]]'', recorded with a new New York quartet featuring [[Thomas Morgan (bassist)|Thomas Morgan]], [[Gerald Cleaver (musician)|Gerald Cleaver]] and [[David Virelles]], and released by [[ECM Records|ECM]] in 2013.\n\nin 2014 Sta\u0144ko was invited to compose a suite on the occasion of the opening of the core exhibition of the [[POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].

The project has included other members, such as  James Harvey on drums, Marc Regueiro-McKelvie on guitar and Damian Sullivan on bass guitar and synthesiser. Teeth & Tongue released four albums, ''Monobasic'' (November 2008), ''Tambourine'' (April 2011), ''Grids'' (March 2014) and ''Give Up on Your Health'' (September 2016), before disbanding early in 2017.

The project has included other members, such as  James Harvey on drums, Marc Regueiro-McKelvie on guitar and Damian Sullivan on bass guitar and synthesiser. Teeth & Tongue released four albums, ''Monobasic'' (November 2008), ''Tambourine'' (April 2011), ''Grids'' (March 2014) and ''Give Up on Your Health'' (September 2016), before disbanding early in 2017.

It encourages people to recite Buddhist scriptures (sutras and mantras) on a daily basis, practise life liberation (that is, saving the lives of beings destined for slaughter), and make great vows to help more people. It is believed that these three \"golden practices\" lay a solid foundation for improved physical and mental well-being.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Rz2U4PrI50VU1xUi1JZkxSVEE/view |location= |publisher= |page=4 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n====Three Golden Buddhist Practices of Guan Yin Citta====\n#Reciting Buddhist sutras/mantras: Guan Yin Citta believes that reciting Buddhist sutras and mantras on a daily basis helps one benefit from the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Recitation will not only help eliminate one\u2019s negative karma; it will also bring strength, wisdom and inner peace, so that one can overcome all kinds of obstacles. The three major sutras and mantras recited by Guan Yin Citta followers are: [[N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b|the Great Compassion Mantra]], the [[Heart Sutra]], and the Eighty-eight Buddhas Repentance. A few optional sutras and mantras are Cundhi Dharani, Mantra to Untie Karmic Knots and Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Mantra<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Rz2U4PrI50VU1xUi1JZkxSVEE/view |location= |publisher= |page=7 |isbn=}}</ref>.\n#Practising life liberation: that is, Release of animals, especially those in grave danger of being killed, is a popular practice performed by all schools of [[Buddhism]]. Guan Yin Citta believes that setting animals free helps one cultivate compassion towards all beings, and deepens the understanding that all living beings are all interdependent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lujunhong2or.com/%E7%B2%BE%E5%BD%A9%E5%BC%80%E7%A4%BA%E4%B8%93%E9%A2%98%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%91%E5%BD%BC%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%91%E5%B7%B1%E5%BF%83%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%89-%E6%94%BE%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84|title=\u6551\u5f7c\u547d\uff0c\u6551\u5df1\u5fc3\u2014\u2014\u653e\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027}}</ref>\n#Making great vows: When one makes a vow, he or she will be motivated to fulfill the vow. The vow then becomes very strong energy; it can overcome countless obstacles. This is especially true when one makes a vow out of compassion.

It will be good enough as long as you have the heart and soul to create a better place for all beings. That is why I respect the Dharma. It doesn't matter which Dharma you choose; it will still be the path that you have to proceed. This is a very important point. Therefore, Chinese in Sydney will practice vegetarian during the first and the fifteenth of the Chinese calendar. There are also a lot of Chinese worshipping the Buddha during festive seasons. Some even know how to practice loving kindness. A few organizations in Sydney such as the [[Tzu Chi Foundation]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]] by Master [[Chin Kung]] and also Master [[Hsing Yun]]'s [[Nan Tien temple]] are all well established with the same priority, and that is to carry forward the Buddhism Teaching in order to unite everyone physically, mentally and soulfully. Hence, I believe that every Buddhist Chinese from all over the world should continue to practice Buddhism as it will benefit in the cultivation of One's mindset, and also to create a peaceful and harmonious world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cn.rfi.fr/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20120718-%E8%87%AA%E5%BA%A6%E5%BA%A6%E4%BA%BA-%E9%87%87%E8%AE%BF%E6%BE%B3%E6%B4%B2%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%E5%AD%A6%E4%BC%9A%E5%8D%A2%E5%86%9B%E5%AE%8F%E4%BC%9A%E9%95%BF|title=\u91c7\u8bbf\u6fb3\u6d32\u534e\u4eba\u4f5b\u6559\u5b66\u4f1a\u5362\u519b\u5b8f\u4f1a\u957f}}</ref>\n\n===World peace===\nOn 26 March 2014 in Washington, DC, Master Lu attended a global summit on world peace as a keynote speaker in the US Congress.

Recitation will not only help eliminate one\u2019s negative karma; it will also bring strength, wisdom and inner peace, so that one can overcome all kinds of obstacles. The three major sutras and mantras recited by Guan Yin Citta followers are: [[N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b|the Great Compassion Mantra]], the [[Heart Sutra]], and the Eighty-eight Buddhas Repentance.

Guan Yin Citta believes that setting animals free helps one cultivate compassion towards all beings, and deepens the understanding that all living beings are all interdependent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lujunhong2or.com/%E7%B2%BE%E5%BD%A9%E5%BC%80%E7%A4%BA%E4%B8%93%E9%A2%98%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%91%E5%BD%BC%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%91%E5%B7%B1%E5%BF%83%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%89-%E6%94%BE%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84|title=\u6551\u5f7c\u547d\uff0c\u6551\u5df1\u5fc3\u2014\u2014\u653e\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027}}</ref>\n#Making great vows: When one makes a vow, he or she will be motivated to fulfill the vow.

It will be good enough as long as you have the heart and soul to create a better place for all beings. That is why I respect the Dharma. It doesn't matter which Dharma you choose; it will still be the path that you have to proceed. This is a very important point. Therefore, Chinese in Sydney will practice vegetarian during the first and the fifteenth of the Chinese calendar. There are also a lot of Chinese worshipping the Buddha during festive seasons. Some even know how to practice loving kindness. A few organizations in Sydney such as the [[Tzu Chi Foundation]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]] by Master [[Chin Kung]] and also Master [[Hsing Yun]]'s [[Nan Tien temple]] are all well established with the same priority, and that is to carry forward the Buddhism Teaching in order to unite everyone physically, mentally and soulfully. Hence, I believe that every Buddhist Chinese from all over the world should continue to practice Buddhism as it will benefit in the cultivation of One's mindset, and also to create a peaceful and harmonious world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cn.rfi.fr/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20120718-%E8%87%AA%E5%BA%A6%E5%BA%A6%E4%BA%BA-%E9%87%87%E8%AE%BF%E6%BE%B3%E6%B4%B2%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%E5%AD%A6%E4%BC%9A%E5%8D%A2%E5%86%9B%E5%AE%8F%E4%BC%9A%E9%95%BF|title=\u91c7\u8bbf\u6fb3\u6d32\u534e\u4eba\u4f5b\u6559\u5b66\u4f1a\u5362\u519b\u5b8f\u4f1a\u957f}}</ref>\n\n===World peace===\nOn 26 March 2014 in Washington, DC, Master Lu attended a global summit on world peace as a keynote speaker in the US Congress.

The knob protruding to the right adjusts the wick, and hence the flame size.]]\n\nA '''kerosene lamp''' (also known as a '''paraffin lamp''' in some countries) is a type of [[lighting]] device that uses [[kerosene]] as a [[fuel]]. Kerosene lamps have a [[Candle wick|wick]] or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held [[lantern]]s may be used for portable lighting. Like [[oil lamp]]s, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without [[rural electrification]], in [[electrification|electrified]] areas during [[power outage]]s, at [[campsite]]s, and on [[boat]]s. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.\n\nPressurized kerosene lamps use a [[gas mantle]]; these are known as [[Petromax]], [[Tilley lamp]]s, or [[Coleman Lantern|Coleman]] lamps, among other manufacturers. They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate. A hand-pump pressurizes air, which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas chamber.

If this type of lamp is broken, it can easily start a fire. A flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank (fount), with the lamp burner attached. Attached to the fuel tank, four prongs hold the glass chimney, which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced [[Chimney#Chimney draught or draft|draft]]. The glass chimney needs a \"throat\", or slight constriction, to create the proper draft for complete [[combustion]] of the fuel; the draft carries more air (oxygen) past the flame, helping to produce a smokeless light, which is brighter than an open flame would produce.\n\nThe chimney is used for a more important duty.  The mantle/wick holder has holes around the outer edges.  When the lantern is lit and a chimney is attached, the thermally induced draft draws air thru these holes and passes over the top of the mantle, just as a chimney in your house.  This has a cooling effect and keeps the mantle from over heating.  Without a properly installed chimney, a definite safety condition exists.  This is even more important if using Aladdin  lamps.  They also have a thinner chimney to induce a faster air-flow.  This information should be adhered to regardless of the type of lantern in use. \n\nThe lamp burner has a flat wick, usually made of [[cotton]]. The lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner.  Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed metal [[sprocket]] bearing against the wick.  If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube, the lamp will produce [[smoke]] and [[soot]] (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow [[flame]].  As the kerosene burns, [[capillary action]] in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below, and hot air exits above.\n\nThis type of lamp was very widely used by railways, both on the front and rear of trains and for hand signals, due to its reliability.  At a time when there were few competing light sources at night outside major towns, the limited brightness of these lamps was adequate and could be seen at sufficient distance to serve as a warning or signal.\n\n=== Central-draft (tubular round wick) lamp<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamp</ref> ===\n{{Main article|Argand lamp}}{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}[[File:Idealbrenner.JPG|thumb|\"Central-draught\" tubular-wick kerosene lamp]]\n\nA central-draught lamp, or [[Argand lamp]], works in the same manner as the flat-wick lamp. The burner is equipped with a tall glass chimney, of around {{convert|12|in}} tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of [[cotton]], that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a \"carrier\", which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the \"central draft\" or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of [[fire]] and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Mantle lamp ===\n{{Main article|Gas mantle}}{{Refimprove section|date=February 2019}}[[File:Sumburgh Lighthouse Lamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An 85&nbsp;mm Chance Brothers ''Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation'', which produced the light for the [[Sumburgh Head Lighthouse|Sumburgh Head lighthouse]] until 1976. The lamp (made around 1914) burned vaporized [[kerosene]] (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a [[denatured alcohol]] (methylated spirit) burner to light. When lit, some of the vaporised fuel was diverted to a [[Bunsen burner]] to keep the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so.  This in turn pressurized the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The \"white sock\" is in fact an unburnt mantle, on which the vapor burned.]]\n\nA variation on the \"central-draught\" lamp is the mantle lamp. The mantle is a roughly pear-shaped mesh made of fabric placed over the burner.  The mantle typically contains [[thorium]] or other [[rare-earth]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]; on first use the cloth burns away, and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides, leaving a very fragile structure, which [[incandescence|incandesces]] (glows brightly) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame. Mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps, produce a whiter light and generate more [[heat]]. Mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp, but slower than a center-draught round-wick, as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle, rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself.\n\nMantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade, and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather. Mantle lamps, because of the higher [[temperature]] at which they operate, do not produce much odor, except when first lit or extinguished.  Like flat- and round-wick lamps, they can be adjusted for brightness; however, caution must be used, because if set too high, the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot. A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down, but if not caught soon enough, the soot itself can ignite, and a \"runaway lamp\" condition can result.\n\nOne popular model of mantle lamp uses only a wick and is unpressurized.{{clarify|date=August 2019}}\n\nLarge fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in [[lighthouse]] beacons for navigation of ships, brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before.<ref>Dennis L.

They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet-metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast. Both hot-blast and cold-blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead-flame lamps, as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tubular Oil Lanterns&nbsp;\u2014 Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.lanterns.us/faqs.htm |publisher=W. T.

This had the effect of removing side-to-side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame.\n\nLater lanterns, such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns, took this airflow control even further by partially or fully enclosing the wick in a \"deflector\" or \"burner cone\" and then channeling the air to be supplied for combustion at the wick while at the same time pre-heating the air for combustion. \n\nThe hot-blast design, also known as a \"tubular lantern\" due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John H. Irwin and was {{US patent|89770|patented on May 4, 1869}}<ref name=\"patent_US_89770_hotBlast\" />. As noted in the patent, the \"novel mode of constructing a lantern whereby the wind, instead of acting upon the flame in such a manner as to extinguish it, serves to support or sustain and prevent the extinguishment thereof.\" This improvement essentially redirected wind which might normally tend to extinguish the flame of an unprotected dead-flame lantern, instead is redirected, slowed, pre-heated, and supplied to the burner to actually suport and promote the combustion of the fuel.  \n\nLater, Irwin improved upon this design by inventing and {{US patent|138654|patenting his cold-blast design on May 6th, 1873}}<ref name=\"patent_US_138654_coldBlast\" />. This design is similar to his earlier \"hot-blast\" design, except that the oxygen-depleted hot combustion byproducts are redirected and prevented from recirculating back to the burner by redesigning the intake products so that only oxygen-rich fresh air is drawn from the atmosphere into the lamp (\"the inlets for fresh air are placed out of the ascending current of products of combustion, and said products are thereby prevented from entering [the air intake]\"<ref name=\"patent_US_138654_coldBlast\" />). The primary benefit of this design compared to the earlier \"hot-blast\" design was to maximize the amount of oxygen available for combustion by ensuring that only fresh air is supplied to the burner thereby increasing the brightness and stability of the flame. <ref name=\"note_term_hotBlastColdBlast\" />\n\n== Fuels ==\nContamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel, with potentially dangerous consequences.  Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires. Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=Joseph E.|last2=Perez|first2=Frank A.|date=April 2008|title=Kerosene lamps and cookstoves\u2014The hazards of gasoline contamination|journal=Fire Safety Journal|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=171\u2013179|doi=10.1016/j.firesaf.2007.08.001}}</ref>\n\n== Performance ==\nFlat-wick lamps have the lowest light output, center-draft round-wick lamps have 3\u20134 times the output of flat-wick lamps, and pressurized lamps have higher output yet; the range is from 8 to 100 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]].

Kerosene lamps have a [[Candle wick|wick]] or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held [[lantern]]s may be used for portable lighting. Like [[oil lamp]]s, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without [[rural electrification]], in [[electrification|electrified]] areas during [[power outage]]s, at [[campsite]]s, and on [[boat]]s. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.\n\nPressurized kerosene lamps use a [[gas mantle]]; these are known as [[Petromax]], [[Tilley lamp]]s, or [[Coleman Lantern|Coleman]] lamps, among other manufacturers. They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate. A hand-pump pressurizes air, which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas chamber. Vapor from the chamber burns, heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat.\n\nKerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of Africa and Asia, where electricity is not distributed or is too costly.

Kirkman Lanterns, Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192016/http://www.lanterns.us/faqs.htm |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest portable kerosene \"glass globe\" lanterns, of the 1850s and 1860s, were of the dead-flame type, meaning that it had an open wick, but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney.  This had the effect of removing side-to-side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame.\n\nLater lanterns, such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns, took this airflow control even further by partially or fully enclosing the wick in a \"deflector\" or \"burner cone\" and then channeling the air to be supplied for combustion at the wick while at the same time pre-heating the air for combustion. \n\nThe hot-blast design, also known as a \"tubular lantern\" due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John H. Irwin and was {{US patent|89770|patented on May 4, 1869}}<ref name=\"patent_US_89770_hotBlast\" />. As noted in the patent, the \"novel mode of constructing a lantern whereby the wind, instead of acting upon the flame in such a manner as to extinguish it, serves to support or sustain and prevent the extinguishment thereof.\" This improvement essentially redirected wind which might normally tend to extinguish the flame of an unprotected dead-flame lantern, instead is redirected, slowed, pre-heated, and supplied to the burner to actually suport and promote the combustion of the fuel.  \n\nLater, Irwin improved upon this design by inventing and {{US patent|138654|patenting his cold-blast design on May 6th, 1873}}<ref name=\"patent_US_138654_coldBlast\" />. This design is similar to his earlier \"hot-blast\" design, except that the oxygen-depleted hot combustion byproducts are redirected and prevented from recirculating back to the burner by redesigning the intake products so that only oxygen-rich fresh air is drawn from the atmosphere into the lamp (\"the inlets for fresh air are placed out of the ascending current of products of combustion, and said products are thereby prevented from entering [the air intake]\"<ref name=\"patent_US_138654_coldBlast\" />). The primary benefit of this design compared to the earlier \"hot-blast\" design was to maximize the amount of oxygen available for combustion by ensuring that only fresh air is supplied to the burner thereby increasing the brightness and stability of the flame. <ref name=\"note_term_hotBlastColdBlast\" />\n\n== Fuels ==\nContamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel, with potentially dangerous consequences.  Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires. Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=Joseph E.|last2=Perez|first2=Frank A.|date=April 2008|title=Kerosene lamps and cookstoves\u2014The hazards of gasoline contamination|journal=Fire Safety Journal|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=171\u2013179|doi=10.1016/j.firesaf.2007.08.001}}</ref>\n\n== Performance ==\nFlat-wick lamps have the lowest light output, center-draft round-wick lamps have 3\u20134 times the output of flat-wick lamps, and pressurized lamps have higher output yet; the range is from 8 to 100 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]].

Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 A.D., the structure occupied more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} of coastline along the [[Gulf of Naples]]. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone</ref>It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level in antiquity.\n\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]\nThe villa's layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian villa suburbana. One entered through the fauces and proceeded to the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nAfter passing through the [[tablinum]], one arrived at the first [[peristyle]], made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area were found the bronze [[Herma|herm]] adapted from the [[Doryphorus]] of [[Polykleitos]]<nowiki/> and the herm of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.<ref name=\"apollonius\">Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).</ref> The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Works of art==\n[[File:Resting Hermes MAN Napoli Inv5625 n02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Barker identified this sculpture as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].

Around the bowl of the atrium [[impluvium]] were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting [[Satyrs]] pouring water from a pitcher and [[Putto|Amorini]] pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n[[File:Danzatrici o danaidi, da villa dei papiri, peristilio quadrato.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of dancers from the peristyle.]]\nFive statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the [[Dorians|Doric]] [[peplos]] sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also [[hydrophorai]] drawing water from a fountain.\n\n==Epicureanism and the library==\nThe owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean [[Philodemus of G\u00e0dara]], although this conclusion is not certain.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref>See Erlend D. MacGillivray, \"The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society\", ''The Ancient World'' XLIII (2012) 151\u2013172.</ref> Followers of [[Epicurus]] studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n[[Image:Papyri.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Papyrus recovered from Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />]]\nAt the time of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a [[pyroclastic flow]]; the eruption eventually deposited some 20\u201325&nbsp;m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the [[scroll]]s but preserving them \u2013 the only surviving library of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] \u2013 as the ash hardened to form [[tuff]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Excavations==\n{{details|Herculaneum papyri}}\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] under [[King Charles VII of Naples]] issued excavations following the re-discovery of [[Herculaneum]] in 1738.<ref>The Academy of Real Navy December 10, 1735 was the first institution to be established by Charles III for cadets, followed 18 November 1787 by the Royal Military Academy (later Military School of Naples): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Goliardia a Pizzofalcone tra il 1841 ed il 1844|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo Edizione Online|date=2013| url=https://www.academia.edu/3394824|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.napoliunplugged.com/the-bourbon-dynasty.html|title=The Bourbon Dynasty in Naples|last=Zaragoza|first=Barbara|date=2013-05-02|website=Napoli Unplugged|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> Excavation work at Herculaneum was done through digging tunnels, and piercing walls, in an attempt to find treasures like paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the [[Museum Herculanense]], part of the King's [[Palace of Portici|Royal Palace in Portici]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-con-2015-3.pdf|title=Excavation and conservation at Pompeii: a conflicted history|author=Stefano De Caro|access-date=January 19, 2019|issn=2412-5229|journal=The Journal of FastiOnline: Archaeological Conservation Series|publisher=The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property}}</ref>\n\nThe Villa of the Papyri was discovered in 1750 by farmers when digging a well.

([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Letters]]''.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]].

Many of the finds are displayed in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].

Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 A.D., the structure occupied more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} of coastline along the [[Gulf of Naples]]. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone</ref>It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level in antiquity.\n\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]\nThe villa's layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian villa suburbana. One entered through the fauces and proceeded to the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nAfter passing through the [[tablinum]], one arrived at the first [[peristyle]], made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area were found the bronze [[Herma|herm]] adapted from the [[Doryphorus]] of [[Polykleitos]]<nowiki/> and the herm of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.<ref name=\"apollonius\">Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).</ref> The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Works of art==\n[[File:Resting Hermes MAN Napoli Inv5625 n02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Barker identified this sculpture as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].

The villa housed a collection of at least 80 sculptures of magnificent quality,<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/villa-of-the-papyri/catalogue-of-sculptures</ref> many now conserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" /> Among them is the bronze ''[[Seated Hermes]]'', found at the villa in 1758. Around the bowl of the atrium [[impluvium]] were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting [[Satyrs]] pouring water from a pitcher and [[Putto|Amorini]] pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n[[File:Danzatrici o danaidi, da villa dei papiri, peristilio quadrato.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of dancers from the peristyle.]]\nFive statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the [[Dorians|Doric]] [[peplos]] sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also [[hydrophorai]] drawing water from a fountain.\n\n==Epicureanism and the library==\nThe owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean [[Philodemus of G\u00e0dara]], although this conclusion is not certain.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref>See Erlend D. MacGillivray, \"The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society\", ''The Ancient World'' XLIII (2012) 151\u2013172.</ref> Followers of [[Epicurus]] studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n[[Image:Papyri.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Papyrus recovered from Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />]]\nAt the time of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a [[pyroclastic flow]]; the eruption eventually deposited some 20\u201325&nbsp;m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the [[scroll]]s but preserving them \u2013 the only surviving library of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] \u2013 as the ash hardened to form [[tuff]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Excavations==\n{{details|Herculaneum papyri}}\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] under [[King Charles VII of Naples]] issued excavations following the re-discovery of [[Herculaneum]] in 1738.<ref>The Academy of Real Navy December 10, 1735 was the first institution to be established by Charles III for cadets, followed 18 November 1787 by the Royal Military Academy (later Military School of Naples): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Goliardia a Pizzofalcone tra il 1841 ed il 1844|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo Edizione Online|date=2013| url=https://www.academia.edu/3394824|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.napoliunplugged.com/the-bourbon-dynasty.html|title=The Bourbon Dynasty in Naples|last=Zaragoza|first=Barbara|date=2013-05-02|website=Napoli Unplugged|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> Excavation work at Herculaneum was done through digging tunnels, and piercing walls, in an attempt to find treasures like paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the [[Museum Herculanense]], part of the King's [[Palace of Portici|Royal Palace in Portici]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-con-2015-3.pdf|title=Excavation and conservation at Pompeii: a conflicted history|author=Stefano De Caro|access-date=January 19, 2019|issn=2412-5229|journal=The Journal of FastiOnline: Archaeological Conservation Series|publisher=The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property}}</ref>\n\nThe Villa of the Papyri was discovered in 1750 by farmers when digging a well.

The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the earlier excavations were still remarkable in quantity and quality.\n\nExcavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\"/> with frescoes in situ.

([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Letters]]''.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library&nbsp;\u2013 which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.\n\n==Works of art==\n===Sculpture from the Villa===\nAccording to the 1908 publication ''Buried Herculaneum'' by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic [[Apollo]], Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (? Poseidon), [[Doryphorus]], Mercury, Homer, Ptolemy Alexander (Alexander the Great?), Ptolemy Philadelphus, Ptolemy Soter I (Seleucus Nicator I), and the mythological Danaids and others.<ref name=\"Barker\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/buriedherculaneu00barkuoft|title=Buried Herculaneum|author=Ethel Ross Barker|year=1908}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Satiro ebbro, da villa dei papiri, peristilio rettangolare, 01.JPG|Statue of a drunken [[satyr]] from the Villa\nFile:6018 - Eschine - Napoli.jpg|Statue of [[Aeschines]] from the Villa.
