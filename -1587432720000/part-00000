As of 2017, McAllen's population was estimated to be 143,433.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> It is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area ([[McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission metropolitan area|McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission]]) in the state of Texas, and the binational [[Reynosa\u2013McAllen metropolitan area]] counts a population of nearly 1.52 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=McAllen Overview |url=http://www.mcallen.org/Business-Community/McAllen-Overview |publisher=McAllen Chamber of Commerce |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nFrom its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character, but the latter half of the 20th century had steady growth, which has continued in the 21st century in the metropolitan area. The introduction of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' economy and the [[North American Free Trade Association]] led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bogan |first= Jesse |title= A Boom at the Border |magazine= Forbes |date= April 2, 2009 |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/01/mexico-texas-economy-business-border.html |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of McAllen, Texas}}\nIn 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (now the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached the Santa Anita Ranch. John McAllen and his son James had donated land to the railroad to guarantee it would cross this area. On December 5, 1904, the McAllen Townsite Company was formed by Uriah Lott, Leonidas C. Hill Sr., John McAllen, James Ball\u00ed McAllen, and John J. Young. The new community, which was named for John McAllen, had the depot nearest the county seat, [[Hidalgo, Texas|Hidalgo]], {{convert|8|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.\n\nBy 1911, {{convert|5000|acre|abbr=on}} were under cultivation in East McAllen: commodity crops of cotton, alfalfa, [[broom corn]], citrus fruits, grapes, and figs were raised. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen had ceased to exist. In 1911, the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|border disturbances]] related to the Mexican Civil War. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916 to 6,000 in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |last= Garza |first= Alicia A. |title= McAllen |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm01 |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen adopted a [[home rule]] charter in 1927. Canning factories, a winery, tortilla plants, wood-working plants, and some oil exploration increased the population to 9,074 by 1930. In 1936, Hiram Garner opened the Valley Distillery, Incorporated, which produced wines from citrus juices. The town was a petroleum and [[Chemurgy|farm chemurgic center]] with a population of 11,877 in 1940, by which time it had adopted the nickname \"The City of Palms\". In 1941, a [[suspension bridge]] replaced the old bridge from Hidalgo to Reynosa in [[Tamaulipas]]; the new toll bridge was purchased by McAllen and was named the [[McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. Its construction resulted in increased tourist trade, making McAllen a winter resort and port of entry to Mexico.\n\nThe discovery of oil in the Reynosa area in 1947 attracted a large migration of people from the Mexican interior to jobs the region. They both constituted a new tourist market and a cheap labor supply for McAllen. The sister cities were linked as a result of the increased traffic between them. The population of McAllen was 20,005 in 1950 and 32,728 in 1960. In 1954 the McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge was the number-two port of entry into Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |title= McAllen-Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge |publisher= Texas Department of Transportation |url= http://www.txdot.gov/project_information/projects/border_crossing/mcallen.htm |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen was an agricultural, oil, and tourist center in 1970, when the population reached 37,636. By the start of the 1970s, McAllen had a 200-bed hospital and a new air-conditioned high school, the first school in the nation featuring on-site power generated by [[natural gas]]-powered turbines. The tourism industry continued to expand as people traveled to the area from both Mexico and the northern United States. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1970s, and reached 66,281 by 1980. During the late 1980s, the McAllen Foreign Trade Zone was an important general-purpose [[foreign trade zone]].<ref>{{cite web |title= City History |publisher= City of McAllen |url= http://www.mcallen.net/info/history.aspx |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref> At the time, McAllen's main industries were retail, tourism and farming, and each was in trouble. The devaluation of the [[Mexican peso]] in the 1980s put a damper on cross-border shopping; local tourism was down because of the [[early 1980s recession|recession]]. In 1983, a freeze took out much of the valley's citrus crop.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, fueled by trade and the growth of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' (in which components are shipped to Mexico from the United States, assembled, and shipped back as finished products), the economy began to improve in Hidalgo County. McAllen sits across the border from Reynosa, a large manufacturing center. After the peso devalued, Mexico was more successful in attracting companies to run their plants in Mexico, with support operations in Texas.\n\nBorder crossing is a daily event for many and is a key component in the local economy.{{r|LAT 2019-03-21}} The city became a focal point for concerns about the border during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019]] over the [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier]].

These major additions turned a once relatively desolate area into a major agricultural center. Throughout much of the 1900s, McAllen was a rural, agriculture-based economy characterized by sporadic growth.\n\nToday, the area is transforming into a major international trade area.

It is located at the southern tip of the state in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. The city limits extend south to the [[Rio Grande]], across from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Reynosa]]. McAllen is about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As of 2017, McAllen's population was estimated to be 143,433.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> It is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area ([[McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission metropolitan area|McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission]]) in the state of Texas, and the binational [[Reynosa\u2013McAllen metropolitan area]] counts a population of nearly 1.52 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=McAllen Overview |url=http://www.mcallen.org/Business-Community/McAllen-Overview |publisher=McAllen Chamber of Commerce |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nFrom its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character, but the latter half of the 20th century had steady growth, which has continued in the 21st century in the metropolitan area. The introduction of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' economy and the [[North American Free Trade Association]] led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bogan |first= Jesse |title= A Boom at the Border |magazine= Forbes |date= April 2, 2009 |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/01/mexico-texas-economy-business-border.html |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of McAllen, Texas}}\nIn 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (now the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached the Santa Anita Ranch. John McAllen and his son James had donated land to the railroad to guarantee it would cross this area. On December 5, 1904, the McAllen Townsite Company was formed by Uriah Lott, Leonidas C. Hill Sr., John McAllen, James Ball\u00ed McAllen, and John J. Young. The new community, which was named for John McAllen, had the depot nearest the county seat, [[Hidalgo, Texas|Hidalgo]], {{convert|8|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.\n\nBy 1911, {{convert|5000|acre|abbr=on}} were under cultivation in East McAllen: commodity crops of cotton, alfalfa, [[broom corn]], citrus fruits, grapes, and figs were raised. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen had ceased to exist. In 1911, the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|border disturbances]] related to the Mexican Civil War. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916 to 6,000 in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |last= Garza |first= Alicia A. |title= McAllen |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm01 |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen adopted a [[home rule]] charter in 1927. Canning factories, a winery, tortilla plants, wood-working plants, and some oil exploration increased the population to 9,074 by 1930. In 1936, Hiram Garner opened the Valley Distillery, Incorporated, which produced wines from citrus juices. The town was a petroleum and [[Chemurgy|farm chemurgic center]] with a population of 11,877 in 1940, by which time it had adopted the nickname \"The City of Palms\". In 1941, a [[suspension bridge]] replaced the old bridge from Hidalgo to Reynosa in [[Tamaulipas]]; the new toll bridge was purchased by McAllen and was named the [[McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. Its construction resulted in increased tourist trade, making McAllen a winter resort and port of entry to Mexico.\n\nThe discovery of oil in the Reynosa area in 1947 attracted a large migration of people from the Mexican interior to jobs the region. They both constituted a new tourist market and a cheap labor supply for McAllen. The sister cities were linked as a result of the increased traffic between them. The population of McAllen was 20,005 in 1950 and 32,728 in 1960. In 1954 the McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge was the number-two port of entry into Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |title= McAllen-Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge |publisher= Texas Department of Transportation |url= http://www.txdot.gov/project_information/projects/border_crossing/mcallen.htm |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen was an agricultural, oil, and tourist center in 1970, when the population reached 37,636. By the start of the 1970s, McAllen had a 200-bed hospital and a new air-conditioned high school, the first school in the nation featuring on-site power generated by [[natural gas]]-powered turbines. The tourism industry continued to expand as people traveled to the area from both Mexico and the northern United States. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1970s, and reached 66,281 by 1980. During the late 1980s, the McAllen Foreign Trade Zone was an important general-purpose [[foreign trade zone]].<ref>{{cite web |title= City History |publisher= City of McAllen |url= http://www.mcallen.net/info/history.aspx |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref> At the time, McAllen's main industries were retail, tourism and farming, and each was in trouble. The devaluation of the [[Mexican peso]] in the 1980s put a damper on cross-border shopping; local tourism was down because of the [[early 1980s recession|recession]]. In 1983, a freeze took out much of the valley's citrus crop.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, fueled by trade and the growth of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' (in which components are shipped to Mexico from the United States, assembled, and shipped back as finished products), the economy began to improve in Hidalgo County. McAllen sits across the border from Reynosa, a large manufacturing center. After the peso devalued, Mexico was more successful in attracting companies to run their plants in Mexico, with support operations in Texas.\n\nBorder crossing is a daily event for many and is a key component in the local economy.{{r|LAT 2019-03-21}} The city became a focal point for concerns about the border during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019]] over the [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier]].

In the show, the overweight participant visits morbidly obese McAllen residents to find motivation for lifestyle and diet changes.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Rio Grande Valley]] began its rapid development with the introduction of [[irrigation]] in 1898 and the construction of the railroad in 1904. These major additions turned a once relatively desolate area into a major agricultural center. Throughout much of the 1900s, McAllen was a rural, agriculture-based economy characterized by sporadic growth.\n\nToday, the area is transforming into a major international trade area. As recently as 1990, McAllen's unemployment rate was at 22.6%. By the end of 2005, that figure had dropped to 7.7%.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Beaches which have aircraft named after them include [[Cable Beach]], [[Cottesloe Beach]] and [[Bondi Beach]].

The Live2Air system was only available on selected Boeing 737 aircraft, and was phased out beginning in 2012.\n\nVirgin Australia's Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A330-200 aircraft's in-flight entertainment ''RED'' is based on the [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation|Panasonic eX2]] system. RED is fully touch-screen and handset controlled. There is no fee for use. RED features an extensive video on demand library that includes new release film, TV series and TV programmes. Destination guides are available. Other functions available through RED include music on demand (approx 200+ CD library) and video games. Seat-to-seat chat is available as well as in flight map and flight information.\n\nIn December 2012, Virgin Australia introduced an in-flight [[Wi-Fi]] system to provide music, movies and TV shows to tablets, smartphones, laptops and similar devices. The system, which does not offer internet access, is estimated to be fitted on all the airline's planes within 2 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.domesticflightaustralia.com/news/virgin-australia-to-provide-inflight-movies-music-via-on-board-wifi-20121224.php |title=Virgin Australia to Provide Inflight Movies, Music via On-Board WiFi |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Virgin Australia began upgrading the in-flight Wi-Fi system in order to offer wireless internet access.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.
