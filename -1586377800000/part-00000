{"title_page": "Charles Stanton", "text_new": "{{about||the US Army officer|Charles E. Stanton|the Adjutant General of Connecticut|Charles T. Stanton}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Charles-Butt-Stanton.jpg|thumb|Charles Butt Stanton]]\n'''Charles Butt Stanton''' (7 April 1873 \u2013 6 December 1946) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[politician]], who served as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] from 1915\u201322. He entered Parliament by winning one of the two seats for [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] at a by-election on 25 November 1915 caused by the death of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] founder, [[Keir Hardie]]. After the two-member [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] seat was divided into two single member seats, Stanton focused on the [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdare division]], which he won at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], but lost at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]].\n\n== Political career ==\n\n===Miner's Agent and District Councillor, Aberdare===\n\nStanton began his political career as a miners' agent at [[Aberdare]] where he was a prominent member of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. In 1904 he was elected to the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]] as a member for the [[Aberaman]] Ward.   A militant, he was critical of the more moderate approach adopted by the local [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP, [[Keir Hardie]].\n\n===The General Election of December 1910 - East Glamorganshire===\n\nAt the General Election of December 1910, Stanton unsuccessfully fought the [[East Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Glamorganshire]] seat as a Labour candidate.\n\nFor 25 years, since its creation in 1886, East Glamorganshire had been represented by the Liberal [[Alfred Thomas, 1st Baron Pontypridd|Alfred Thomas]], a prominent Baptist and former Mayor of Cardiff, who stood as candidate of 'The Liberal and Labour Association' in the constituency. For the 1910 General Election, the East Glamorganshire Liberal and Labour Association selected [[Clement Edwards]]. Edwards had solid [[Lib-Lab]] credentials - a barrister who had represented trade unions in major cases, he was also personally active in organising trade unions and industrial action. But Edwards was not a socialist, and he was opposed to a separate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>Duncan Tanner, ''(Allen) Clement Edwards'' in Dictionary of National Biography online, OUP 2004\u201310</ref>\n\nIn February 1910, Stanton comfortably won a poll organised by the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] to select a candidate for East Glamorganshire should Alfred Thomas retire (C. B. Stanton 6,297; [[Alfred Onions]] 3,214; Thomas Andrews 3,156; [[Thomas Mardy Jones|T. I. Mardy Jones]] 2,257).<ref>''The Aberdare Leader'', 12 February 1910, p 7; ''Weekly Mail'', 12 February 1910, p 11</ref> In May 1910, Stanton was selected as the Labour candidate for the seat by a trade union delegates meeting<ref>''Evening Express'', 23 May 1910, p3</ref> and by July 1910 he was described as the 'accepted Labour candidate for East Glamorgan'.<ref>''Evening Express'', 5 July 1910, p 3</ref> However, Stanton was not universally popular among the leadership of the South Wales Miners Federation and the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], in part because of his militant position on industrial disputes. In November 1910, the Executive Committee of the M.F.G.B. at first refused to put Stanton's name on the Federation Parliamentary List for East Glamorgan, a decision which was reversed the following day.<ref>''The Aberdare Leader'', 26 November 1910, p 5</ref>\n\nAt the General Election on December 1910, Clement Edwards comfortably won the seat, the Conservative candidate took second place, while Stanton finished third : Edwards (Lib-Lab) 9,088; Gaskell (Con) 5,603; Stanton (Lab) 4,675. In his speech at the declaration, Stanton said that \"Although defeated, he was by no means downhearted, as he realised that he was preaching a new gospel for which the electors were evidently not prepared, but the day would come when his views would be much more acceptable.<ref>''The Aberdare Leader'', 17 December 1910, p 8; ''The Cardiff Times'', 17 December 1910, p 8</ref>\n\n===The Merthyr By-election of November 1915===\n\nWhen the United Kingdom entered the First World War, Stanton became a strong supporter of the national war effort, and publicly opposed Keir Hardie's stance opposed to the war.\n\nHardie's death, on 2 September 1915, a year after the outbreak of the war, caused a vacancy in one of the two Merthyr Tydfil parliamentary seats. The by-election to fill the vacancy was called for 25 November 1915.\n\nThe official Labour choice to succeed Keir Hardie was [[James Winstone]]. Winstone was a leader of the miners' union - a miner's agent since 1906, he had served as Vice-President of the South Wales Miners Federation since 1912, and had recently been elected President of the South Wales Federation. He had also been a County Councillor in neighbouring Monmouthshire since 1906, and was a former chairman of the [[Urban District Council]]s of both Risca and Abersychan.\n\nIn the four by-elections held in Wales since the outbreak of war, the candidate of the former member's party had been returned unopposed, in accordance with an electoral truce agreed between the parties. It was assumed therefore that the Labour Party candidate to succeed Keir Hardie would also be returned unopposed. [[Arthur Henderson]], the Secretary of the Labour Party, wrote to the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' on 17 November stating that Winstone's candidature was supported and approved by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, the South Wales Miners' Federation, the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Merthyr constituency conference \"representative practically of every organisation in the constituency\", and \"Accordingly, other parties have intimated their intention of observing the obligations of the party truce.\"\n\nStanton announced that he would stand against Winstone on a patriotic, win-the-war platform. Stanton's campaign focused its attack on the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Stanton presented himself as a 'National' candidate - \"... standing on a National platform, and respecting, as I am, the political truce, I am considering not only the opinion of Labour men but of all sections of the community. And hence I do not hesitate to say that my candidature is national in the truest sense of the term. Surely, it is obvious that the success of Mr. Winstone, which is unthinkable, would be a message of discouragement to our soldiers in the field ...\"\n\nIn fact, unlike Hardie, Winstone was not a pacifist : he was a supporter of the war effort. One of his sons was already serving in France and another had just volunteered. Winstone himself addressed recruiting meetings. However, Winstone did not support conscription.\n\nOfficially the national [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties were not involved in the by-election. But their members actively supported the Stanton campaign on the ground. On 23 November, the ''Western Mail'' carried a letter to Stanton's election agent from [[Thomas Artemus Jones|T. Artemus Jones]], who had been adopted as the prospective [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate before the outbreak of war, stating that there \"was no foundation [for] the rumour ... that the 'official' candidate [i.e. Winstone] must receive the support of all the great parties ... Such a contest as is being waged in Merthyr is outside the terms of the party truce because it is essentially a domestic difference among the members of one party and neither of the other parties in the State has any sort of right to interfere either with the one section or the other.\" Jones added that members of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties were free to support Stanton : \"There is only one issue, one duty before the people. So long as the war lasts and the party truce continues, there are neither Tories nor Radicals nor Socialists in the party sense. That issue is the war and that duty is the vigorous prosecution of the war. ...  neither the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] nor the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] are concerned in their political organisations with the dispute between Mr. Stanton and the [[Independent Labour Party]]. In their capacity as citizens, however, they have the right to form their own judgement at this supreme hour in the fortunes of the country with regard to the support they must give the government.\"\n\nStanton was also endorsed by the [[Socialist National Defence Committee]].<ref>A nationalist grouping which split from the [[British Socialist Party]] in April 1915. A precursor of the [[British Workers National League]] (1916) (later shortened to the [[British Workers League]]).

(Stanton: 10,286 votes; Winstone: 6,080 votes).\n\nA few weeks after Stanton's election, on 6 January 1916, the government introduced its first conscription bill. Stanton's by-election victory in Keir Hardie's old seat has been seen as facilitating the introduction of conscription.<ref>See for example: ''The Conscription Controversy in Great Britain, 1900\u201318'', by [[R. J. Q. Adams]], Philip P. Poirier (1987), at p. 132; ''Margot Asquith's Great War Diary 1914-1916: The View from Downing Street'', edited by [[Michael Brock]], Eleanor Brock (Oxford, OUP, 2016), Introduction to Part VII</ref>\n\nStanton supported the [[Lloyd George Coalition Government]] throughout the war.\n\n===The 'Khaki' General Election of December 1918===\n\nUnder the Representation of the People Act 1918, the existing parliamentary borough of Merthyr Tydfil (with its two parliamentary seats) was divided into two single-member constituencies. One of these was [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil, Aberdare Division]], which consisted of the two urban districts of Aberdare and Mountain Ash.\n\nStanton fought the \"Coupon\" general election of December 1918 for the Aberdare Division, as a [[National Democratic and Labour Party]] candidate, with the support of the Coalition National Government \"[[Coalition Coupon|coupon]]\". He comfortably defeated the Labour candidate, [[Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais)]]. (Stanton: 22,824 votes; Nicholas: 6,229 votes)\n\nStanton and Nicholas had taken opposite positions during the War - Nicholas, like Hardie, was a pacifist, and had opposed both the War and conscription. They were also opposed in their policies for the peace, Stanton supporting the policy of imposing heavy reparations obligations on the defeated nations : his manifesto demanded that \"the filthy, murderous Huns\" be made to pay for the war. Stanton also called for the expulsion of \"all aliens\".\n\n(In the Merthyr Division, at the 1918 general election, Sir Edgar Rees Jones, standing as a [[Coalition Liberal]], defeated [[James Winstone]], standing again as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, by 1,445 votes. Sir Edgar Rees Jones had first been elected to Parliament at the January 1910 general election as one of the two MPs for Merthyr Tydfil).\n\n===The General Election of November 1922===\n\nStanton again fought the [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdare division]] at the general election of November 1922, this time as a Lloyd George [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal]] candidate. He was defeated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, [[George Henry Hall, 1st Viscount Hall|George Hall]]. (Hall: 20,704 votes; Stanton: 15,487 votes). Hall went on to hold the Aberdare seat for the Labour Party for the next twenty years, and the Labour Party continued to hold the Aberdare seat until the constituency was abolished in 1983.\n\nIn 1928 Stanton joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\nStanton's failure at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] was shared by the nine other MPs seeking to hold seats they had won in the \"khaki\" election of 1918 under the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]] banner. Among the nine was Clement Edwards, who had defeated Stanton in East Glamorganshire in 1910 : Edwards won [[East Ham South (UK Parliament constituency)|East Ham South]] as the NDLP candidate in 1918 ; he defended that seat as a National Liberal supporter of Lloyd George in 1922, but was defeated by the Labour candidate.\n\n(In 1922, [[R. C. Wallhead]] won the single-seat Merthyr division for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. Like [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais)]], Wallhead had been a committed opponent of [[World War I]]. Wallhead held the Merthyr Division until his death in 1934, when [[S. O. Davies]] won the seat for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. Davies held the seat for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] until the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1970]], when he was deselected by the Labour Party, but won the seat as an Independent Socialist. Upon Davies' death in 1972, [[Ted Rowlands]] regained the seat for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://biography.wales/article/s2-STAN-BUT-1873 'STANTON , CHARLES BUTT (1873-1946), M.P. for the Merthyr and Aberdare constituency, 1915-1922'] by Professor Huw Morris-Jones (2001), ''Dictionary of Welsh Biography (Welsh Biography Online)'', National Library of Wales; retrieved 26 August 2017\n* [https://www.parliament.uk/documents/heritage/Charles%20Butt%20Stanton.pdf 'Charles Butt Stanton MP (1873-1946)'], on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|U.K. Parliament]] website; retrieved 26 August 2017\n* [https://www.llgc.org.uk/fileadmin/fileadmin/docs_gwefan/amdanom_ni/cylchgrawn_llgc/cgr_erth_XXXVrhif3_2012_5.pdf 'Charles Butt Stanton 1873-1946'] by Ivor T Rees, ''The National Library of Wales Journal'', Vol XXXV No 3 (2010), retrieved 2 May 2017\n* 'The Merthyr Boroughs Election, November 1915', by Anthony M\u00f4r-O'Brien, ''[[Welsh History Review]]'', Vol. 12, no. 4 (1985) pp 538\u2013566, online at [https://journals.library.wales/home ''Welsh Journals Online''] (National Library of Wales) (retrieved 26 August 2017)\n* [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/new-history-wales-dr-louise-1889456 'Remembering 1910'], 'A new history of Wales' by Dr Louise Miskill, ''WalesOnline'' (5 Oct 2010; updated 28 Mar 2013; retrieved 2 Aug 2017) (includes an account of Stanton's radical leadership in the 1910 Powell Duffryn coal strike)\n* {{hansard-contribs | mr-charles-stanton | Charles Stanton}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  = [[Keir Hardie]]\n | before2 = [[Edgar Jones (politician)|Edgar Jones]]\n}}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]]\n | years = [[1915 Merthyr Tydfil by-election|1915]]\u2013[[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n | with  = [[Edgar Jones (politician)|Edgar Jones]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished }}\n\n{{s-new | constituency}}\n{{s-ttl\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdare]]\n | years  = [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\u2013[[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[George Henry Hall, 1st Viscount Hall|George Hall]] }}\n{{s-npo|union}}\n{{succession box|title=Agent of the Aberdare District of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]]|years=1900\u20131916|before=[[David Morgan (trade unionist)|David Morgan]]|after=Owen Powell}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stanton, Charles}}\n[[Category:1873 births]]\n[[Category:1946 deaths]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922]]\n[[Category:National Democratic and Labour Party MPs]]\n[[Category:People from Aberdare]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) politicians]]\n[[Category:National Liberal Party (UK< 1922) politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the US Army officer|Charles E.

He entered Parliament by winning one of the two seats for [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] at a by-election on 25 November 1915 caused by the death of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] founder, [[Keir Hardie]]. After the two-member [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] seat was divided into two single member seats, Stanton focused on the [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdare division]], which he won at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], but lost at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]].\n\n== Political career ==\n\n===Miner's Agent and District Councillor, Aberdare===\n\nStanton began his political career as a miners' agent at [[Aberdare]] where he was a prominent member of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. In 1904 he was elected to the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]] as a member for the [[Aberaman]] Ward.   A militant, he was critical of the more moderate approach adopted by the local [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP, [[Keir Hardie]].\n\n===The General Election of December 1910 - East Glamorganshire===\n\nAt the General Election of December 1910, Stanton unsuccessfully fought the [[East Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Glamorganshire]] seat as a Labour candidate.\n\nFor 25 years, since its creation in 1886, East Glamorganshire had been represented by the Liberal [[Alfred Thomas, 1st Baron Pontypridd|Alfred Thomas]], a prominent Baptist and former Mayor of Cardiff, who stood as candidate of 'The Liberal and Labour Association' in the constituency. For the 1910 General Election, the East Glamorganshire Liberal and Labour Association selected [[Clement Edwards]]. Edwards had solid [[Lib-Lab]] credentials - a barrister who had represented trade unions in major cases, he was also personally active in organising trade unions and industrial action. But Edwards was not a socialist, and he was opposed to a separate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>Duncan Tanner, ''(Allen) Clement Edwards'' in Dictionary of National Biography online, OUP 2004\u201310</ref>\n\nIn February 1910, Stanton comfortably won a poll organised by the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] to select a candidate for East Glamorganshire should Alfred Thomas retire (C. B. Stanton 6,297; [[Alfred Onions]] 3,214; Thomas Andrews 3,156; [[Thomas Mardy Jones|T. I. Mardy Jones]] 2,257).<ref>''The Aberdare Leader'', 12 February 1910, p 7; ''Weekly Mail'', 12 February 1910, p 11</ref> In May 1910, Stanton was selected as the Labour candidate for the seat by a trade union delegates meeting<ref>''Evening Express'', 23 May 1910, p3</ref> and by July 1910 he was described as the 'accepted Labour candidate for East Glamorgan'.<ref>''Evening Express'', 5 July 1910, p 3</ref> However, Stanton was not universally popular among the leadership of the South Wales Miners Federation and the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], in part because of his militant position on industrial disputes. In November 1910, the Executive Committee of the M.F.G.B. at first refused to put Stanton's name on the Federation Parliamentary List for East Glamorgan, a decision which was reversed the following day.<ref>''The Aberdare Leader'', 26 November 1910, p 5</ref>\n\nAt the General Election on December 1910, Clement Edwards comfortably won the seat, the Conservative candidate took second place, while Stanton finished third : Edwards (Lib-Lab) 9,088; Gaskell (Con) 5,603; Stanton (Lab) 4,675. In his speech at the declaration, Stanton said that \"Although defeated, he was by no means downhearted, as he realised that he was preaching a new gospel for which the electors were evidently not prepared, but the day would come when his views would be much more acceptable.<ref>''The Aberdare Leader'', 17 December 1910, p 8; ''The Cardiff Times'', 17 December 1910, p 8</ref>\n\n===The Merthyr By-election of November 1915===\n\nWhen the United Kingdom entered the First World War, Stanton became a strong supporter of the national war effort, and publicly opposed Keir Hardie's stance opposed to the war.\n\nHardie's death, on 2 September 1915, a year after the outbreak of the war, caused a vacancy in one of the two Merthyr Tydfil parliamentary seats. The by-election to fill the vacancy was called for 25 November 1915.\n\nThe official Labour choice to succeed Keir Hardie was [[James Winstone]]. Winstone was a leader of the miners' union - a miner's agent since 1906, he had served as Vice-President of the South Wales Miners Federation since 1912, and had recently been elected President of the South Wales Federation. He had also been a County Councillor in neighbouring Monmouthshire since 1906, and was a former chairman of the [[Urban District Council]]s of both Risca and Abersychan.\n\nIn the four by-elections held in Wales since the outbreak of war, the candidate of the former member's party had been returned unopposed, in accordance with an electoral truce agreed between the parties. It was assumed therefore that the Labour Party candidate to succeed Keir Hardie would also be returned unopposed. [[Arthur Henderson]], the Secretary of the Labour Party, wrote to the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' on 17 November stating that Winstone's candidature was supported and approved by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, the South Wales Miners' Federation, the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Merthyr constituency conference \"representative practically of every organisation in the constituency\", and \"Accordingly, other parties have intimated their intention of observing the obligations of the party truce.\"\n\nStanton announced that he would stand against Winstone on a patriotic, win-the-war platform. Stanton's campaign focused its attack on the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Stanton presented himself as a 'National' candidate - \"... standing on a National platform, and respecting, as I am, the political truce, I am considering not only the opinion of Labour men but of all sections of the community. And hence I do not hesitate to say that my candidature is national in the truest sense of the term. Surely, it is obvious that the success of Mr. Winstone, which is unthinkable, would be a message of discouragement to our soldiers in the field ...\"\n\nIn fact, unlike Hardie, Winstone was not a pacifist : he was a supporter of the war effort. One of his sons was already serving in France and another had just volunteered. Winstone himself addressed recruiting meetings. However, Winstone did not support conscription.\n\nOfficially the national [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties were not involved in the by-election. But their members actively supported the Stanton campaign on the ground. On 23 November, the ''Western Mail'' carried a letter to Stanton's election agent from [[Thomas Artemus Jones|T. Artemus Jones]], who had been adopted as the prospective [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate before the outbreak of war, stating that there \"was no foundation [for] the rumour ... that the 'official' candidate [i.e. Winstone] must receive the support of all the great parties ... Such a contest as is being waged in Merthyr is outside the terms of the party truce because it is essentially a domestic difference among the members of one party and neither of the other parties in the State has any sort of right to interfere either with the one section or the other.\" Jones added that members of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties were free to support Stanton : \"There is only one issue, one duty before the people.

In conversation with Carnegie at his home, [[Skibo Castle]] in [[Sutherland]], Smith celebrated the success of Keighley's students but lamented the need for a public library in the town to support them. Carnegie promised \u00a310,000 to create such a library on the understanding that Keighley was also willing to help itself and invoke the [[Public Libraries Act 1850|Public Libraries Act of 1850]].

In many ways he was typical of the public-spirited, self-made Victorian. Of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] lineage, he believed in social and intellectual improvement, the virtues of hard work and thrift and the role of the Liberal Party in the encouragement and promotion of this ethic.\n\n==Family and education==\nSwire Smith was born in [[Keighley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the eldest son of George Smith and his wife Mary (n\u00e9e Swire).<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\">''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> He was educated at the local [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] in Keighley and at [[Wesley College, Sheffield]].<ref>Asa Briggs, ''Sir Swire Smith'' in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', OUP 2004-09</ref> He never married.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''Serious Pursuits: Communications and Education, The Collected Essays of Asa Briggs, Volume 3''; Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991 p419</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nOn leaving school Smith served an [[apprenticeship]] with a Keighley [[worsted]] manufacturer. He soon began to develop his interest in education however and at the age of 24, was appointed honorary secretary to the building committee of the Keighley Institute, a society the object of which was \"Mutual Instruction in Mechanics, Experimental Philosophy and Mathematics\u201d which later became the Keighley Boy\u2019s Grammar School.<ref>http://www.kbgs.com/khist2.htm</ref> He was prominent in the reorganisation of the institute and was largely responsible for the school\u2019s gaining in notability.<ref name=\"The Times, 18 March 1918 p5\">The Times, 18 March 1918 p5</ref>\n\n===Technical education===\n\nSmith became an expert in the area of [[Vocational education|technical education]].

He was duly elected [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for Keighley, his election being remarkable for his advanced age at the time of the contest, and he entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at the age of 73.<ref>The Times, 6 July 1915 p6</ref>\n\n==Other appointments and honours==\nSmith was [[knighted]] in the [[Queen Victoria|Queen\u2019s]] birthday honours list of May 1898.<ref>The Times, 21 May 1898 p12</ref> He was a [[Justice of the Peace]] for the West Riding and for Keighley,<ref>H H Bassett (ed.), ''Men of Note in Finance and Commerce''; 1900 p201</ref> Vice Chairman of the Royal Commission on International Exhibitions,<ref>The Times, 24 March 1909 p6</ref> a member of the Standing Committee of Advice for Education in Art <ref>The Times, 12 July 1912 p9</ref> and in 1912 he was granted the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Laws]] by [[Leeds University]].<ref>The Times, 24 September 1912 p8</ref> He was made a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of Keighley in 1914 <ref name=\"The Times, 18 March 1918 p5\"/> and in 1967, Eastwood School in Keighley was renamed the Swire Smith [[List of middle schools in England|Middle School]] in his honour and memory.<ref>http://www.swiresm.legend.yorks.com/</ref>\n\n==Keighley Library==\nThrough his friendship with the Scottish-American philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], Smith was instrumental in the founding of Keighley\u2019s first public library. In conversation with Carnegie at his home, [[Skibo Castle]] in [[Sutherland]], Smith celebrated the success of Keighley\u2019s students but lamented the need for a public library in the town to support them. Carnegie promised \u00a310,000 to create such a library on the understanding that Keighley was also willing to help itself and invoke the [[Public Libraries Act 1850|Public Libraries Act of 1850]]. The Borough Council provided the site and held a competition to design the building in Edwardian Free Style with [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] influence.

It was later described and named ''Chelonia multiscutata'' by [[Heinrich Kuhl]] in 1820. Still later, it was described and named ''Chelonia olivacea'' by [[Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz]] in 1829. The species was placed in the [[subgenus]] ''Lepidochelys'' by [[Leopold Fitzinger]] in 1843.<ref name=EOL/> After ''Lepidochelys'' was elevated to full [[genus]] status, the species was called ''Lepidochelys olivacea'' by [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard]] in 1858. Because Eschscholtz was the first to propose the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''olivacea'', he is credited as the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial authority]] or [[taxon]] author in the valid name ''Lepidochelys olivacea'' (Eschscholtz, 1829). The parentheses indicate that the species was \noriginally described in a different genus.\n\nThe [[genus|generic name]], ''Lepidochelys'', is derived from the Greek words ''lepidos'', meaning scale, and ''chelys'', which translates to turtle. This could possibly be a reference to the supernumerary costal scute counts characteristic of this genus.<ref name=NMFS/> The [[etymology]] of the English vernacular name \"olive\" is somewhat easier to resolve, as its carapace is olive green in color.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Richard|title=The Empty Ocean: Plundering the World's Marine Life|url=https://archive.org/details/emptyoceanplunde00elli|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington|isbn=1597265993}}</ref> However, the origin of \"ridley\" is still somewhat unclear, perhaps derived from \"riddle\".<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Males and females grow to the same size; however, females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to males.<ref name=\"wwfindia.org\" /> The heart-shaped carapace is characterized by four pairs of pore-bearing inframarginal [[scutes]] on the bridge, two pairs of prefrontals, and up to nine lateral scutes per side. ''L. olivacea'' is unique in that it can have variable and asymmetrical lateral scute counts, ranging from five to nine plates on each side, with six to eight being most commonly observed.<ref name=NMFS>{{cite web|title=Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the Olive Ridley Turtle (''Lepidochelys olivacea'')|url=https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15966|publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service|accessdate=16 April 2013|location=Silver Spring, MD|year=1998}}</ref> Each side of the carapace has 12\u201314 marginal scutes.\n\nThe carapace is flattened dorsally and highest anterior to the bridge. it has a medium-sized, broad head that appears triangular from above. The head's concave sides are most obvious on the upper part of the short snout. It has paddle-like fore limbs, each having two anterior claws. The upper parts are grayish green to olive in color, but sometimes appear reddish due to [[algae]] growing on the carapace. The bridge and hingeless [[plastron]] of an adult varies from greenish white in younger individuals to a creamy yellow in older specimens (maximum age is up to 50 years).<ref name=NMFS/><ref name=Ernst>{{cite book|last=Ernst|first=Carl H.|title=Turtles of the United States and Canada |year=1994 |publisher=Smithsonian Inst.

A thin, white line borders the carapace, as well as the trailing edge of the fore and hind flippers.<ref name=Ernst/> Both hatchlings and juveniles have serrated posterior marginal scutes, which become smooth with age. Juveniles also have three dorsal keels; the central longitudinal keel gives younger turtles a serrated profile, which remains until sexual maturity is reached.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\nThe olive ridley sea turtle rarely weighs over 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb). Adults studied in [[Oaxaca City|Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]],<ref name=NMFS/> ranged from {{convert|25|to|46|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; adult females weighed an average of {{convert|35.45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (n=58), while adult males weighed significantly less, averaging {{convert|33.00|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (n=17). Hatchlings usually weigh between {{convert|12.0|and|23.3|g|oz|abbr=on}}.\n\nAdults are sexually dimorphic. The mature male has a longer and thicker tail, which is used for [[Animal sexual behavior|copulation]],<ref name=NMFS/> and the presence of enlarged and hooked claws on the male's front flippers allows it to grasp the female's carapace during copulation. The male also has a longer, more tapered carapace than the female, which has a rounded, dome-like carapace.<ref name=NMFS/> The male also has a more concave plastron, believed to be another adaptation for mating. The plastron of the male may also be softer than that of the female.<ref name=Ernst/>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[Image:Lieux pontes tortue olivatre.png|thumb|660px|right|''Lepidochelys olivacea'' distribution map: red circles are major nesting grounds; yellow circles are minor nesting beaches.]]\n\nThe olive ridley turtle has a circumtropical distribution, living in [[tropical]] and warm waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans from [[India]], [[Arabia]], [[Japan]], and Micronesia south to southern Africa, Australia, and [[New Zealand]]. In the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it has been observed off the western coast of Africa and the coasts of northern [[Brazil]], [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Venezuela]]. Additionally, the olive ridley has been recorded in the Caribbean Sea as far north as Puerto Rico.

They lay their eggs in conical nests about one and a half feet deep, which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers.<ref name=\"wwfindia.org\">[http://www.wwfindia.org/about_wwf/priority_species/lesser_known_species/olive_ridley_turtle/ \"Olive ridley Turtle\"]. ''wwfindia.org''.</ref> In the Indian Ocean, the majority of olive ridleys nest in two or three large groups near Gahirmatha in [[Odisha]]. The coast of Odisha in India is one the largest mass nesting site for the olive ridley, along with the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica.<ref name=\"wwfindia.org\"/> In 1991, over 600,000 turtles nested along the coast of Odisha in one week. Nesting occurs elsewhere along the [[Coromandel Coast]] and [[Sri Lanka]], but in scattered locations. However, olive ridleys are considered a rarity in most areas of the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Plotkin/>\n\nThey are also rare in the western and central Pacific, with known ''arribadas'' occurring only within the tropical eastern Pacific, in Central America and Mexico. In Costa Rica, they occur at Nancite and [[Ostional Wildlife Refuge|Ostional]] beaches. Two active ''arribadas'' are in Nicaragua, Chacocente and La Flor, with a small nesting ground in Pacific Panama. Historically, several ''arribadas'' were in Mexico, Playa Escobilla and Morro Ayuda in Oaxaca, and Ixtapilla in Michoacan are the three ''arribada'' beaches in the present .<ref name=Plotkin/>\n\nAlthough olive ridleys are famed for their ''arribadas'', many of the nesting grounds can only support relatively small to moderate-sized aggregations (about 1,000 nesting females). The overall contribution and importance of these nesting beaches to the population may be underestimated by the scientific community.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n===Foraging grounds===\nSome of the olive ridley's foraging grounds near southern California are contaminated due to sewage, agricultural runoff, pesticides, solvents, and industrial discharges. These contaminants have been shown to decrease the productivity of the benthic community, which negatively affects these turtles, which feed from these communities.<ref name=NMFS/> The increasing demand to build marinas and docks near Baja California and southern California are also negatively affecting the olive ridleys in these areas, where more oil and gasoline will be released into these sensitive habitats. Another threat to these turtles is power plants, which have documented juvenile and subadult turtles becoming entrained and entrapped within the saltwater cooling intake systems.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\n[[Image:Olive ridley sea turtle laying eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An olive ridley sea turtle laying eggs|alt=Photo of rear of turtle on beach with three white, round eggs lying behind it in a small hole in the sand]]\n\n===Reproduction===\nMating is often assumed to occur in the vicinity of nesting beaches, but [[copulation (zoology)|copulating]] pairs have been reported over 1,000&nbsp;km from the nearest beach. Research from Costa Rica revealed the number of copulating pairs observed near the beach could not be responsible for the fertilization of the tens of thousands of [[gravid]] females, so a significant amount of mating is believed to have occurred elsewhere at other times of the year.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\nThe Gahirmatha Beach in Kendrapara district of Odisha (India), which is now a part of the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, is the largest breeding ground for these turtles. The Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, which bounds the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary to the east, was created in September 1997, and encompasses Gahirmatha Beach and an adjacent portion of the Bay of Bengal. Bhitarkanika mangroves were designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2002. It is the world's largest known rookery of olive ridley sea turtles. Apart from Gahirmatha rookery, two other mass nesting beaches have been located, which are on the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi. The spectacular site of mass congregation of olive ridley sea turtles for mating and nesting enthralls both the scientists and the nature lovers throughout the world.\n\nOlive ridley sea turtles migrate in huge numbers from the beginning of November, every year, for mating and nesting along the coast of Orissa. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between 100,000 and 500,000 each year. A decline in the population of these turtles has occurred in the recent past due to mass mortality. The olive ridley sea turtle has been listed on Schedule \u2013 I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991). The species is listed as vulnerable under IUCN.<ref name=IUCN/> The sea turtles are protected under the 'Migratory Species Convention' and Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna (CITES). India is a signatory nation to all these conventions. The homing characteristics of the ridley sea turtles make them more prone to mass casualty. The voyage to the natal nesting beaches is the dooming factor for them. Since Gahirmatha coast serves as the natal nesting beach for millions of turtles, it has immense importance on turtle conservation.\n\nOlive ridleys generally begin to aggregate near nesting beaches about two months before nesting season, although this may vary throughout their range. In the eastern Pacific, nesting occurs throughout the year, with peak nesting events (''arribadas'') occurring between September and December. Nesting beaches can be characterized as relatively flat, midbeach zone, and free of debris.<ref name=EOL>{{EOL|1056177|Lepidochelys olivacea}}. Retrieved 16 April 2013.</ref> Beach [[fidelity]] is common, but not absolute. Nesting events are usually nocturnal, but diurnal nesting has been reported, especially during large ''arribadas''.<ref name=NMFS/> Exact age of sexual maturity is unknown, but this can be somewhat inferred from data on minimum breeding size. For example, the average carapace length of nesting females (n = 251) at Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, was determined to be 63.3&nbsp;cm, with the smallest recorded at 54.0&nbsp;cm.<ref name=NMFS /> Females can lay up to three [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]es per season, but most only lay one or two clutches.<ref name=Ernst/> The female remains near shore for the internesting period, which is about one month. Mean clutch size varies throughout its range and decreases with each nesting attempt.<ref name=Plotkin/>\n\nA mean clutch size of 116 (30\u2013168 eggs) was observed in [[Surinam]], while nesting females from the eastern Pacific were found to have an average of 105 (74\u2013126 eggs).<ref name=Ernst/> The incubation period is usually between 45 and 51 days under natural conditions, but may extend to 70 days in poor weather conditions. Eggs incubated at temperatures of 31 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C produce only females; eggs incubated at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C or less produce solely males; and incubation temperatures of 29 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C produce a mixed-sex clutch.<ref name=Ernst/> Hatching success can vary by beach and year, due to changing environmental conditions and rates of nest predation.\n\n===Habitat===\nMost observations are typically within 15&nbsp;km of mainland shores in protected, relatively shallow marine waters (22\u201355 m deep).<ref name=Ernst/> Olive ridleys are occasionally found in open waters. The multiple habitats and geographical localities used by this species vary throughout its lifecycle.<ref name=EOL/> More research is needed to acquire data on and use of [[pelagic]] habitats.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe olive ridley is predominantly [[carnivorous]], especially in immature stages of the lifecycle. Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or [[estuarine]] habitats. Common prey items include [[jellyfish]], [[tunicates]], [[sea urchins]], [[bryozoans]], [[bivalves]], snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and [[sipunculid]] worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. ''Sphoeroides'') and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding.<ref name=Ernst/> The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources. Captive studies have indicated some level of [[cannibalistic]] behavior in this species.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n===Threats===\n[[File:Mart new.jpg|thumb|Olive ridley entangled in a [[ghost net]] within the Maldives]]\n[[File:Lepidochelys olivacea Landaa.JPG|thumb|Taken in a drifting net in the [[Maldives]]]]\n[[File:Turtlekill1.jpg|right|thumb|Floating in the [[Arabian Sea]], possibly killed by a boat propeller]]\n[[File:Olive Ridley hatchlings in Chennai.jpg|right|thumb|Hatchlings in [[Chennai]]]]\nKnown predators of olive ridley eggs include raccoons, coyotes, feral dogs and pigs, [[opossums]], coatimundi, [[caimans]], [[ghost crabs]], and the [[sunbeam snake]].<ref name=Ernst /> Hatchlings are preyed upon as they travel across the beach to the water by vultures, [[frigate bird]]s, crabs, [[raccoon]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[iguana]]s, and snakes. In the water, hatchling [[predator]]s most likely include [[oceanic fish]]es, [[shark]]s, and crocodiles. Adults have relatively few known predators, other than sharks, and [[killer whale]]s are responsible for occasional attacks. On land, nesting females may be attacked by [[jaguar]]s. Notably, the jaguar is the only cat with a strong enough bite to penetrate a sea turtle's shell, thought to be an evolutionary adaption from the [[Holocene extinction]] event. In observations of jaguar attacks, the cats consumed the neck muscles of the turtle and occasionally the flippers, but left the remainder of the turtle carcass for scavengers as most likely, despite the strength of its jaws, a jaguar still cannot easily penetrate an adult turtle's shell to reach the internal organs or other muscles. In recent years, increased predation on turtles by jaguars has been noted, perhaps due to habitat loss and fewer alternative food sources. Sea turtles are comparatively defenseless in this situation, as they cannot pull their heads into their shells like freshwater and terrestrial turtles.<ref name=NMFS/><ref>[https://news.mongabay.com/2012/05/jaguar-v-sea-turtle-when-land-and-marine-conservation-icons-collide/ \"Jaguar v. sea turtle: when land and marine conservation icons collide\"]. ''news.mongabay.com''.</ref> Females are often plagued by [[mosquito]]s during nesting. Humans are still listed as the leading threat to ''L. olivacea'', responsible for unsustainable egg collection, slaughtering nesting females on the beach, and direct harvesting adults at sea for commercial sale of both the meat and hides.<ref name=Ernst/>\n\nOther major threats include mortality associated with boat collisions, and incidental takes in fisheries. [[Trawling]], [[gill net]]s, ghost nests, [[longline fishing]], and pot fishing have significantly affected olive ridley populations, as well as other species of marine turtles.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=NMFS /> Between 1993 and 2003, more than 100,000 olive ridley turtles were reported dead in Odisha, India from fishery-related practices.<ref name=Shanker>{{cite journal|last=Shanker|first=K.|author2=Ramadevi, J. |author3=Choudhury, B.

For example, in Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, only 0.2% of the 11.5 million eggs produced in a single ''arribada'' successfully hatched. Although some of this loss resulted from [[predation]] and high tides, the majority was attributed to [[conspecifics]] unintentionally destroying existing nests. The extent to which ''arribadas'' contribute to the population status of olive ridleys has created debate among scientists. Many believe the massive reproductive output of these nesting events is critical to maintaining populations, while others maintain the traditional ''arribada'' beaches fall far short of their reproductive potential and are most likely not sustaining population levels.<ref name=NMFS/> In some areas, this debate eventually led to legalizing egg collection.\n\n==Economic importance==\nHistorically, the olive ridley has been exploited for food, bait, oil, leather, and [[fertilizer]]. The meat is not considered a delicacy; the egg, however, is esteemed everywhere. Egg collection is illegal in most of the countries where olive ridleys nest, but these laws are rarely enforced. Harvesting eggs has the potential to contribute to local economies, so the unique practice of allowing a sustainable (legal) egg harvest has been attempted in several localities.<ref name=Plotkin/> Numerous case studies have been conducted in regions of ''arribadas'' [[beach]]es to investigate and understand the socioeconomic, cultural, and political issues of egg collection. Of these, the legal egg harvest at Ostional, Costa Rica, has been viewed by many as both biologically sustainable and economically viable. Since egg collection became legal in 1987, local villagers have been able to harvest and sell around three million eggs annually. They are permitted to collect eggs during the first 36 hours of the nesting period, as many of these eggs would be destroyed by later nesting females. Over 27 million eggs are left unharvested, and villagers have played a large role in protecting these nests from predators, thereby increasing hatching success.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\nMost participating households reported egg harvesting as their most important activity, and profits earned were superior to other forms of available employment, other than tourism. The price of Ostional eggs was intentionally kept low to discourage illegal collection of eggs from other beaches. The Ostional project retained more local profits than similar egg collection projects in Nicaragua,<ref name=Plotkin/> but evaluating egg-harvesting projects such as this suffers from the short timeline and site specificity of findings. In most regions, illegal poaching of eggs is considered a major threat to olive ridley populations, thus the practice of allowing legal egg harvests continues to attract criticism from conservationists and sea turtle biologists. Plotkin's ''Biology and Conservation of Ridley Sea Turtles'', particularly the chapter by Lisa Campbell titled \"Understanding Human Use of Olive Ridleys\", provides further research on the Ostional harvest (as well as other harvesting projects). Scott Drucker's documentary, ''Between the Harvest'', offers a glimpse into this world and the debate surrounding it.\n\n==Conservation status==\n[[File:Olive ridley turtles.JPG|thumb|left|Two olive ridley hatchlings moving into the ocean after being released from a conservation site in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.|alt=Photo of two small turtles crawling on beach]]\n\nThe olive ridley is classified as vulnerable according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN), and is listed in Appendix I of [[CITES]]. These listings were largely responsible for halting the large-scale commercial exploitation and trade of olive ridley skins.<ref name=IUCN/> The [[Convention on Migratory Species]] and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles have also provided olive ridleys with protection, leading to increased conservation and management for this marine turtle. National listings for this species range from [[endangered]] to [[threatened]], yet enforcing these sanctions on a global scale has been unsuccessful for the most part. Conservation successes for the olive ridley have relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local communities and nongovernment organizations, which focused primarily on public outreach and education. ''Arribada'' management has also played a critical role in conserving olive ridleys.<ref name=Plotkin/> Lastly, enforcing the use of turtle excluder devices in the shrimp-trawling industry has also proved effective in some areas.<ref name=IUCN/> Globally, the olive ridley continues to receive less conservation attention than its close relative, the Kemp's ridley (''L. kempii''). Also, many schools arrange trips for students to carry out the conservation project, especially in India.\n\nSeveral projects worldwide seek to preserve the olive ridley sea turtle population. For example, in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, when the turtles come to the beach to lay their eggs, some of them are relocated to a hatchery, where they have a much better chance to survive. If the eggs were left on the beach, they would face many threats such as getting washed away with the tide or getting poached. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are carried to the beach and released.\n\nAnother major project, in India involved in preserving the olive ridley sea turtle population was carried out in Chennai, where the Chennai wildlife team collected close to 10,000  eggs along the Marina coast, of which 8,834 hatchlings were successfully released into the sea in a phased manner.<ref>[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140523/nation-current-affairs/article/over-8000-turtle-hatchlings-released \"Over 8000 turtle hatchlings released\"], ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', Chennai, 23 May 2014.

It was later described and named ''Chelonia multiscutata'' by [[Heinrich Kuhl]] in 1820. Still later, it was described and named ''Chelonia olivacea'' by [[Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz]] in 1829. The species was placed in the [[subgenus]] ''Lepidochelys'' by [[Leopold Fitzinger]] in 1843.<ref name=EOL/> After ''Lepidochelys'' was elevated to full [[genus]] status, the species was called ''Lepidochelys olivacea'' by [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard]] in 1858. Because Eschscholtz was the first to propose the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''olivacea'', he is credited as the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial authority]] or [[taxon]] author in the valid name ''Lepidochelys olivacea'' (Eschscholtz, 1829). The parentheses indicate that the species was \noriginally described in a different genus.\n\nThe [[genus|generic name]], ''Lepidochelys'', is derived from the Greek words ''lepidos'', meaning scale, and ''chelys'', which translates to turtle. This could possibly be a reference to the supernumerary costal scute counts characteristic of this genus.<ref name=NMFS/> The [[etymology]] of the English vernacular name \"olive\" is somewhat easier to resolve, as its carapace is olive green in color.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Richard|title=The Empty Ocean: Plundering the World's Marine Life|url=https://archive.org/details/emptyoceanplunde00elli|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington|isbn=1597265993}}</ref> However, the origin of \"ridley\" is still somewhat unclear, perhaps derived from \"riddle\".<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Males and females grow to the same size; however, females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to males.<ref name=\"wwfindia.org\" /> The heart-shaped carapace is characterized by four pairs of pore-bearing inframarginal [[scutes]] on the bridge, two pairs of prefrontals, and up to nine lateral scutes per side. ''L. olivacea'' is unique in that it can have variable and asymmetrical lateral scute counts, ranging from five to nine plates on each side, with six to eight being most commonly observed.<ref name=NMFS>{{cite web|title=Recovery Plan for U.S. Pacific Populations of the Olive Ridley Turtle (''Lepidochelys olivacea'')|url=https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15966|publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service|accessdate=16 April 2013|location=Silver Spring, MD|year=1998}}</ref> Each side of the carapace has 12\u201314 marginal scutes.\n\nThe carapace is flattened dorsally and highest anterior to the bridge. it has a medium-sized, broad head that appears triangular from above. The head's concave sides are most obvious on the upper part of the short snout. It has paddle-like fore limbs, each having two anterior claws. The upper parts are grayish green to olive in color, but sometimes appear reddish due to [[algae]] growing on the carapace. The bridge and hingeless [[plastron]] of an adult varies from greenish white in younger individuals to a creamy yellow in older specimens (maximum age is up to 50 years).<ref name=NMFS/><ref name=Ernst>{{cite book|last=Ernst|first=Carl H.|title=Turtles of the United States and Canada |year=1994 |publisher=Smithsonian Inst.

A thin, white line borders the carapace, as well as the trailing edge of the fore and hind flippers.<ref name=Ernst/> Both hatchlings and juveniles have serrated posterior marginal scutes, which become smooth with age. Juveniles also have three dorsal keels; the central longitudinal keel gives younger turtles a serrated profile, which remains until sexual maturity is reached.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\nThe olive ridley sea turtle rarely weighs over 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb). Adults studied in [[Oaxaca City|Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]],<ref name=NMFS/> ranged from {{convert|25|to|46|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; adult females weighed an average of {{convert|35.45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (n=58), while adult males weighed significantly less, averaging {{convert|33.00|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (n=17).

The mature male has a longer and thicker tail, which is used for [[Animal sexual behavior|copulation]],<ref name=NMFS/> and the presence of enlarged and hooked claws on the male's front flippers allows it to grasp the female's carapace during copulation. The male also has a longer, more tapered carapace than the female, which has a rounded, dome-like carapace.<ref name=NMFS/> The male also has a more concave plastron, believed to be another adaptation for mating.

The eastern Pacific turtles have been found to range from [[Baja California]], Mexico, to Chile. Pacific olive ridleys nest around [[Costa Rica]], Mexico, [[Nicaragua]], and the northern Indian Ocean; the breeding colony in Mexico was listed as endangered in the US on July 28, 1978.<ref name=Oceana>{{cite web |title=Forging a Future for Pacific Sea Turtles |url=http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Forging20a20Future20for20Pacific20Sea20Turtles1.pdf|publisher=Oceana|accessdate=16 April 2013 |page=6 |year=2007}}</ref>\n\n===Nesting grounds===\n[[File:Olive ridley hatchling in Mexico (8218893828).jpg|thumb|left|Olive ridley hatchling]]\n[[File:Turles nesting escobilla oxaca mexico claudio giovenzana 2010.jpg|thumb|Nesting]]\nOlive ridley turtles are best known for their behavior of synchronized nesting in mass numbers, termed ''arribadas''.<ref name=Ernst/> Females return to the same beach from where they hatched, to lay their eggs. They lay their eggs in conical nests about one and a half feet deep, which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers.<ref name=\"wwfindia.org\">[http://www.wwfindia.org/about_wwf/priority_species/lesser_known_species/olive_ridley_turtle/ \"Olive ridley Turtle\"]. ''wwfindia.org''.</ref> In the Indian Ocean, the majority of olive ridleys nest in two or three large groups near Gahirmatha in [[Odisha]]. The coast of Odisha in India is one the largest mass nesting site for the olive ridley, along with the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica.<ref name=\"wwfindia.org\"/> In 1991, over 600,000 turtles nested along the coast of Odisha in one week. Nesting occurs elsewhere along the [[Coromandel Coast]] and [[Sri Lanka]], but in scattered locations. However, olive ridleys are considered a rarity in most areas of the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Plotkin/>\n\nThey are also rare in the western and central Pacific, with known ''arribadas'' occurring only within the tropical eastern Pacific, in Central America and Mexico. In Costa Rica, they occur at Nancite and [[Ostional Wildlife Refuge|Ostional]] beaches. Two active ''arribadas'' are in Nicaragua, Chacocente and La Flor, with a small nesting ground in Pacific Panama. Historically, several ''arribadas'' were in Mexico, Playa Escobilla and Morro Ayuda in Oaxaca, and Ixtapilla in Michoacan are the three ''arribada'' beaches in the present .<ref name=Plotkin/>\n\nAlthough olive ridleys are famed for their ''arribadas'', many of the nesting grounds can only support relatively small to moderate-sized aggregations (about 1,000 nesting females). The overall contribution and importance of these nesting beaches to the population may be underestimated by the scientific community.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n===Foraging grounds===\nSome of the olive ridley's foraging grounds near southern California are contaminated due to sewage, agricultural runoff, pesticides, solvents, and industrial discharges. These contaminants have been shown to decrease the productivity of the benthic community, which negatively affects these turtles, which feed from these communities.<ref name=NMFS/> The increasing demand to build marinas and docks near Baja California and southern California are also negatively affecting the olive ridleys in these areas, where more oil and gasoline will be released into these sensitive habitats. Another threat to these turtles is power plants, which have documented juvenile and subadult turtles becoming entrained and entrapped within the saltwater cooling intake systems.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\n[[Image:Olive ridley sea turtle laying eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An olive ridley sea turtle laying eggs|alt=Photo of rear of turtle on beach with three white, round eggs lying behind it in a small hole in the sand]]\n\n===Reproduction===\nMating is often assumed to occur in the vicinity of nesting beaches, but [[copulation (zoology)|copulating]] pairs have been reported over 1,000&nbsp;km from the nearest beach. Research from Costa Rica revealed the number of copulating pairs observed near the beach could not be responsible for the fertilization of the tens of thousands of [[gravid]] females, so a significant amount of mating is believed to have occurred elsewhere at other times of the year.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\nThe Gahirmatha Beach in Kendrapara district of Odisha (India), which is now a part of the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, is the largest breeding ground for these turtles. The Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, which bounds the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary to the east, was created in September 1997, and encompasses Gahirmatha Beach and an adjacent portion of the Bay of Bengal. Bhitarkanika mangroves were designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2002. It is the world's largest known rookery of olive ridley sea turtles. Apart from Gahirmatha rookery, two other mass nesting beaches have been located, which are on the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi. The spectacular site of mass congregation of olive ridley sea turtles for mating and nesting enthralls both the scientists and the nature lovers throughout the world.\n\nOlive ridley sea turtles migrate in huge numbers from the beginning of November, every year, for mating and nesting along the coast of Orissa. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between 100,000 and 500,000 each year. A decline in the population of these turtles has occurred in the recent past due to mass mortality. The olive ridley sea turtle has been listed on Schedule \u2013 I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991). The species is listed as vulnerable under IUCN.<ref name=IUCN/> The sea turtles are protected under the 'Migratory Species Convention' and Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna (CITES). India is a signatory nation to all these conventions. The homing characteristics of the ridley sea turtles make them more prone to mass casualty. The voyage to the natal nesting beaches is the dooming factor for them. Since Gahirmatha coast serves as the natal nesting beach for millions of turtles, it has immense importance on turtle conservation.\n\nOlive ridleys generally begin to aggregate near nesting beaches about two months before nesting season, although this may vary throughout their range. In the eastern Pacific, nesting occurs throughout the year, with peak nesting events (''arribadas'') occurring between September and December. Nesting beaches can be characterized as relatively flat, midbeach zone, and free of debris.<ref name=EOL>{{EOL|1056177|Lepidochelys olivacea}}. Retrieved 16 April 2013.</ref> Beach [[fidelity]] is common, but not absolute. Nesting events are usually nocturnal, but diurnal nesting has been reported, especially during large ''arribadas''.<ref name=NMFS/> Exact age of sexual maturity is unknown, but this can be somewhat inferred from data on minimum breeding size. For example, the average carapace length of nesting females (n = 251) at Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, was determined to be 63.3&nbsp;cm, with the smallest recorded at 54.0&nbsp;cm.<ref name=NMFS /> Females can lay up to three [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]es per season, but most only lay one or two clutches.<ref name=Ernst/> The female remains near shore for the internesting period, which is about one month. Mean clutch size varies throughout its range and decreases with each nesting attempt.<ref name=Plotkin/>\n\nA mean clutch size of 116 (30\u2013168 eggs) was observed in [[Surinam]], while nesting females from the eastern Pacific were found to have an average of 105 (74\u2013126 eggs).<ref name=Ernst/> The incubation period is usually between 45 and 51 days under natural conditions, but may extend to 70 days in poor weather conditions. Eggs incubated at temperatures of 31 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C produce only females; eggs incubated at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C or less produce solely males; and incubation temperatures of 29 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C produce a mixed-sex clutch.<ref name=Ernst/> Hatching success can vary by beach and year, due to changing environmental conditions and rates of nest predation.\n\n===Habitat===\nMost observations are typically within 15&nbsp;km of mainland shores in protected, relatively shallow marine waters (22\u201355 m deep).<ref name=Ernst/> Olive ridleys are occasionally found in open waters. The multiple habitats and geographical localities used by this species vary throughout its lifecycle.<ref name=EOL/> More research is needed to acquire data on and use of [[pelagic]] habitats.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe olive ridley is predominantly [[carnivorous]], especially in immature stages of the lifecycle. Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or [[estuarine]] habitats. Common prey items include [[jellyfish]], [[tunicates]], [[sea urchins]], [[bryozoans]], [[bivalves]], snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and [[sipunculid]] worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. ''Sphoeroides'') and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding.<ref name=Ernst/> The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources. Captive studies have indicated some level of [[cannibalistic]] behavior in this species.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\n===Threats===\n[[File:Mart new.jpg|thumb|Olive ridley entangled in a [[ghost net]] within the Maldives]]\n[[File:Lepidochelys olivacea Landaa.JPG|thumb|Taken in a drifting net in the [[Maldives]]]]\n[[File:Turtlekill1.jpg|right|thumb|Floating in the [[Arabian Sea]], possibly killed by a boat propeller]]\n[[File:Olive Ridley hatchlings in Chennai.jpg|right|thumb|Hatchlings in [[Chennai]]]]\nKnown predators of olive ridley eggs include raccoons, coyotes, feral dogs and pigs, [[opossums]], coatimundi, [[caimans]], [[ghost crabs]], and the [[sunbeam snake]].<ref name=Ernst /> Hatchlings are preyed upon as they travel across the beach to the water by vultures, [[frigate bird]]s, crabs, [[raccoon]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[iguana]]s, and snakes. In the water, hatchling [[predator]]s most likely include [[oceanic fish]]es, [[shark]]s, and crocodiles. Adults have relatively few known predators, other than sharks, and [[killer whale]]s are responsible for occasional attacks. On land, nesting females may be attacked by [[jaguar]]s. Notably, the jaguar is the only cat with a strong enough bite to penetrate a sea turtle's shell, thought to be an evolutionary adaption from the [[Holocene extinction]] event. In observations of jaguar attacks, the cats consumed the neck muscles of the turtle and occasionally the flippers, but left the remainder of the turtle carcass for scavengers as most likely, despite the strength of its jaws, a jaguar still cannot easily penetrate an adult turtle's shell to reach the internal organs or other muscles. In recent years, increased predation on turtles by jaguars has been noted, perhaps due to habitat loss and fewer alternative food sources. Sea turtles are comparatively defenseless in this situation, as they cannot pull their heads into their shells like freshwater and terrestrial turtles.<ref name=NMFS/><ref>[https://news.mongabay.com/2012/05/jaguar-v-sea-turtle-when-land-and-marine-conservation-icons-collide/ \"Jaguar v. sea turtle: when land and marine conservation icons collide\"]. ''news.mongabay.com''.</ref> Females are often plagued by [[mosquito]]s during nesting. Humans are still listed as the leading threat to ''L. olivacea'', responsible for unsustainable egg collection, slaughtering nesting females on the beach, and direct harvesting adults at sea for commercial sale of both the meat and hides.<ref name=Ernst/>\n\nOther major threats include mortality associated with boat collisions, and incidental takes in fisheries. [[Trawling]], [[gill net]]s, ghost nests, [[longline fishing]], and pot fishing have significantly affected olive ridley populations, as well as other species of marine turtles.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=NMFS /> Between 1993 and 2003, more than 100,000 olive ridley turtles were reported dead in Odisha, India from fishery-related practices.<ref name=Shanker>{{cite journal|last=Shanker|first=K.|author2=Ramadevi, J. |author3=Choudhury, B.

Coastal development, natural disasters, [[climate change]], and other sources of [[beach erosion]] have also been cited as potential threats to nesting grounds.<ref name=NMFS/> Additionally, coastal development also threatens newly hatched turtles through the effects of light pollution.<ref name=Karnad2009>{{cite journal |last=Karnad |first=Divya |author2=Isvaran, Kavita |author3=Kar, Chandrasekhar S. |author4= Shanker, Kartik  |title=Lighting the way: Towards reducing misorientation of olive ridley hatchlings due to artificial lighting at Rushikulya, India |journal=Biological Conservation |date=1 October 2009 |volume=142 |issue=10 |pages=2083\u20132088 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2009.04.004}}</ref> Hatchlings which use light cues to orient themselves to the sea are now misled into moving towards land, and die from dehydration or exhaustion, or are killed on roads.\n\nHowever, the greatest single cause of olive ridley egg loss results from ''arribadas'', in which the density of nesting females is so high, previously laid nests are inadvertently dug up and destroyed by other nesting females.<ref name=NMFS/> In some cases, [[nest]]s become cross-contaminated by [[bacteria]] or pathogens of rotting nests. For example, in Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, only 0.2% of the 11.5 million eggs produced in a single ''arribada'' successfully hatched. Although some of this loss resulted from [[predation]] and high tides, the majority was attributed to [[conspecifics]] unintentionally destroying existing nests. The extent to which ''arribadas'' contribute to the population status of olive ridleys has created debate among scientists. Many believe the massive reproductive output of these nesting events is critical to maintaining populations, while others maintain the traditional ''arribada'' beaches fall far short of their reproductive potential and are most likely not sustaining population levels.<ref name=NMFS/> In some areas, this debate eventually led to legalizing egg collection.\n\n==Economic importance==\nHistorically, the olive ridley has been exploited for food, bait, oil, leather, and [[fertilizer]]. The meat is not considered a delicacy; the egg, however, is esteemed everywhere. Egg collection is illegal in most of the countries where olive ridleys nest, but these laws are rarely enforced. Harvesting eggs has the potential to contribute to local economies, so the unique practice of allowing a sustainable (legal) egg harvest has been attempted in several localities.<ref name=Plotkin/> Numerous case studies have been conducted in regions of ''arribadas'' [[beach]]es to investigate and understand the socioeconomic, cultural, and political issues of egg collection. Of these, the legal egg harvest at Ostional, Costa Rica, has been viewed by many as both biologically sustainable and economically viable. Since egg collection became legal in 1987, local villagers have been able to harvest and sell around three million eggs annually. They are permitted to collect eggs during the first 36 hours of the nesting period, as many of these eggs would be destroyed by later nesting females. Over 27 million eggs are left unharvested, and villagers have played a large role in protecting these nests from predators, thereby increasing hatching success.<ref name=NMFS/>\n\nMost participating households reported egg harvesting as their most important activity, and profits earned were superior to other forms of available employment, other than tourism. The price of Ostional eggs was intentionally kept low to discourage illegal collection of eggs from other beaches. The Ostional project retained more local profits than similar egg collection projects in Nicaragua,<ref name=Plotkin/> but evaluating egg-harvesting projects such as this suffers from the short timeline and site specificity of findings. In most regions, illegal poaching of eggs is considered a major threat to olive ridley populations, thus the practice of allowing legal egg harvests continues to attract criticism from conservationists and sea turtle biologists. Plotkin's ''Biology and Conservation of Ridley Sea Turtles'', particularly the chapter by Lisa Campbell titled \"Understanding Human Use of Olive Ridleys\", provides further research on the Ostional harvest (as well as other harvesting projects). Scott Drucker's documentary, ''Between the Harvest'', offers a glimpse into this world and the debate surrounding it.\n\n==Conservation status==\n[[File:Olive ridley turtles.JPG|thumb|left|Two olive ridley hatchlings moving into the ocean after being released from a conservation site in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.|alt=Photo of two small turtles crawling on beach]]\n\nThe olive ridley is classified as vulnerable according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN), and is listed in Appendix I of [[CITES]]. These listings were largely responsible for halting the large-scale commercial exploitation and trade of olive ridley skins.<ref name=IUCN/> The [[Convention on Migratory Species]] and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles have also provided olive ridleys with protection, leading to increased conservation and management for this marine turtle. National listings for this species range from [[endangered]] to [[threatened]], yet enforcing these sanctions on a global scale has been unsuccessful for the most part. Conservation successes for the olive ridley have relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local communities and nongovernment organizations, which focused primarily on public outreach and education. ''Arribada'' management has also played a critical role in conserving olive ridleys.<ref name=Plotkin/> Lastly, enforcing the use of turtle excluder devices in the shrimp-trawling industry has also proved effective in some areas.<ref name=IUCN/> Globally, the olive ridley continues to receive less conservation attention than its close relative, the Kemp's ridley (''L. kempii''). Also, many schools arrange trips for students to carry out the conservation project, especially in India.\n\nSeveral projects worldwide seek to preserve the olive ridley sea turtle population. For example, in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, when the turtles come to the beach to lay their eggs, some of them are relocated to a hatchery, where they have a much better chance to survive. If the eggs were left on the beach, they would face many threats such as getting washed away with the tide or getting poached. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are carried to the beach and released.\n\nAnother major project, in India involved in preserving the olive ridley sea turtle population was carried out in Chennai, where the Chennai wildlife team collected close to 10,000  eggs along the Marina coast, of which 8,834 hatchlings were successfully released into the sea in a phased manner.<ref>[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140523/nation-current-affairs/article/over-8000-turtle-hatchlings-released \"Over 8000 turtle hatchlings released\"], ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', Chennai, 23 May 2014.
