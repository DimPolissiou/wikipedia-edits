It is named for [[Manhattan]], the principal [[Borough (New York City)|borough of the City of New York]]. Currently offering a purse of $1,000,000, the [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] Manhattan Handicap is open to 4-year-olds & up, and is run on [[grass|turf]] over the classic distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles.\n\nInaugurated in 1867 at the now defunct [[Jerome Park Racetrack]] it was there through 1894 when the racetrack closed. Moved in 1895 to [[Morris Park Racecourse]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] it remained there through 1904 when that racetrack also closed down. In 1905 the race was moved to [[Belmont Park]]. It was contested on dirt from inception through 1970, and again in 1977, 1979 and 1988. The race was hosted by [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in 1959 and 1961, plus between 1963 and 1967.\n\nThere was no race held in 1897 and 1909 to 1913. Large fields in 1971, 1972, 1975 and 1977 saw the race divided into two divisions.\n\nSince 1994, the race has been run on the undercard of the final leg of the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|U.S. Triple Crown]], the [[Belmont Stakes]].\n\nOver the years, the Manhattan Handicap has been set at a variety of distances:\n* 1867-1896, 1978 to present : {{convert|1+1/4|mi|furlong}}\n* 1898-1908 : six furlongs\n* 1914-1915 : seven furlongs\n* 1916-1932 : 1 mile\n* 1933-1958, 1960, 1962, 1963\u20131964, 1968\u20131969, 1977 : {{convert|1+1/2|mi|furlong}}\n* 1961 : {{convert|1+5/16|mi|furlong}}\n* 1959, 1965-1967 : {{convert|1+5/8|mi|furlong}}\n* 1970 to 1976 : {{convert|1+3/8|mi|furlong}}\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed  record:'''\n*1:57.79 - [[Paradise Creek (horse)|Paradise Creek]] (1994)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 3 - [[Bolingbroke (horse)|Bolingbroke]] (1940, 1942, 1943)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]:'''\n* 5 - [[Jerry D.

It is named for [[Manhattan]], the principal [[Borough (New York City)|borough of the City of New York]]. Currently offering a purse of $1,000,000, the [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] Manhattan Handicap is open to 4-year-olds & up, and is run on [[grass|turf]] over the classic distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles.\n\nInaugurated in 1867 at the now defunct [[Jerome Park Racetrack]] it was there through 1894 when the racetrack closed. Moved in 1895 to [[Morris Park Racecourse]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] it remained there through 1904 when that racetrack also closed down. In 1905 the race was moved to [[Belmont Park]]. It was contested on dirt from inception through 1970, and again in 1977, 1979 and 1988. The race was hosted by [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in 1959 and 1961, plus between 1963 and 1967.\n\nThere was no race held in 1897 and 1909 to 1913. Large fields in 1971, 1972, 1975 and 1977 saw the race divided into two divisions.\n\nSince 1994, the race has been run on the undercard of the final leg of the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|U.S. Triple Crown]], the [[Belmont Stakes]].\n\nOver the years, the Manhattan Handicap has been set at a variety of distances:\n* 1867-1896, 1978 to present : {{convert|1+1/4|mi|furlong}}\n* 1898-1908 : six furlongs\n* 1914-1915 : seven furlongs\n* 1916-1932 : 1 mile\n* 1933-1958, 1960, 1962, 1963\u20131964, 1968\u20131969, 1977 : {{convert|1+1/2|mi|furlong}}\n* 1961 : {{convert|1+5/16|mi|furlong}}\n* 1959, 1965-1967 : {{convert|1+5/8|mi|furlong}}\n* 1970 to 1976 : {{convert|1+3/8|mi|furlong}}\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed  record:'''\n*1:57.79 - [[Paradise Creek (horse)|Paradise Creek]] (1994)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 3 - [[Bolingbroke (horse)|Bolingbroke]] (1940, 1942, 1943)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]:'''\n* 5 - [[Jerry D.

He earned two Test caps against Wales and England on the tour and was a member of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal winning Wallabies at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London games]]. On his return to Australia he joined the fledgling code of rugby league along with 13 of his Olympic teammates.\n[[File:Postcard - Wallabies 1908.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Hickey front row 2nd from right, with the 1908 Wallaby tour squad]] \n[[File:Olympic Rugby 1908.jpg|thumb|right|200px| 1908 Olympic Gold Final Wallabies v Cornwall.]]\n\n==Rugby league career==\nHickey made his international league debut in the First Test in Sydney on 18 June 1910. Four of his former [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallaby]] team mates also debuted that day [[John Barnett (rugby)|John Barnett]], [[Bob Craig (footballer)|Bob Craig]], [[Charles Russell (footballer)|Charles Russell]] and [[Chris McKivat]] - making them collectively Australia's 11th to 15th dual code internationals. This mirrored a similar occurrence two years earlier when five former Wallabies in [[Micky Dore]], [[Dally Messenger]], [[Denis Lutge]], [[Doug McLean snr]] and \n[[John Rosewell]] all debuted for the [[Australian national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] in the first ever Test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].\n\nHe played in both rugby league Tests of the [[1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia]], the first ever, and scored the first ever try for Australia in a rugby league Test Match. Darb Hickey played 4 seasons with [[Glebe (rugby league team)]] and one season at [[Balmain Tigers]] during his club career.\n\n==Death==\n\"Darb' Hickey died of cancer on 15 May 1950 at the Sacred Heart Hospice, St. Vincent's Hospital.

Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs. Form was given a more prominent role than function.<ref name=\"Worboys 2019\">{{cite web | last=Worboys | first=Michael | title=The history of dog breeds | website=The Week | date=2019-04-13 | url=https://theweek.com/articles/832600/history-dog-breeds | access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"KC-Standard\">{{cite web | title=About Breed Standards | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/activities/dog-showing/breed-standards/about-breed-standards/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> Different types or breeds of dog were being developed by breeders who wanted to define specific characteristics and desirable features in their dogs.<ref name=\"KC-Standard\"/> Driven by dog shows and the groups that hosted them, the term dog breed took on an entirely new meaning. Dog show competitions included best in breed winners, and the purebreds were winning.<ref name=\"Worboys 2019\"/> Breed standards are the reason the breed came to be, and with those standards are key features, including form, function and fitness for purpose. [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK was founded in 1873, and was the world's first national kennel club and breed registry.<ref name=\"KC-founding\">{{cite web | title=History of the Kennel Club | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/about-the-kennel-club/history-of-the-kennel-club/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> They became the guardians of their country's breed standards. Over time, other breed registries followed suit.      \n\n==First dog breeds==\n[[File:Engag\u00e9 mit einem indianischen Hundeschlitten by Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sled dog]] types, sketched in 1833]]\n[[File:Tesem2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Tesem]], an ancient Egyptian sighthound]]\n\nThe domestic dog is the first species, and the only large [[carnivore]], to have been domesticated. Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog\u2013wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard.

Strong [[artificial selection]] has developed around 450 globally recognized breeds. These breeds possess distinct [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] traits including body size, skull shape, tail [[phenotype]], fur colour and fur type. They also possess behavioral traits including herding, guarding, and hunting, in addition to personality traits such as aggression, boldness, or hypersocial behavior. Most of these breeds were developed within the last 200 years using only small numbers of [[Founder effect|founders]]. As a result, the large phenotypic variation across dog breeds can be studied through the analysis with only a small number of [[genetic markers]].<ref name=Ostrander2019/>\n\n{{cladogram\n|caption=[[Cladogram]] of nine breeds that are genetically divergent from others<ref name=parker2004/>|\n|cladogram=\n{{clade|style=font-size:75%; line-height:75%;width:300px;\n  |1=[[Wolf]]\n  |2={{clade\n       |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Shar Pei]]\n            |2={{clade\n                 |1=[[Shiba Inu]]\n                 |2={{clade\n                     |1=[[Chow Chow]]\n                     |2=[[Akita Inu]]\n                   }}\n               }}\n          }}\n       |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Basenji]]\n            |2={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                     |1=[[Siberian Husky]]\n                     |2=[[Alaskan Malamute]]\n                   }}\n                |2={{clade\n                     |1={{clade\n                          |1=[[Afghan Hound]]\n                          |2=[[Saluki]]\n                        }}\n                     |2=other breeds in the study\n                   }}\n               }}\n          }}\n     }}\n}}\n}}\n\n===Ancient dog breeds===\n\"Ancient breed\" is a term formerly, but no longer, used for a particular group of dog breeds by the American Kennel Club.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club 2006\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=American Kennel Club|title=Dog breed groups|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/}}</ref> These breeds were referred to as \"ancient\", as opposed to modern, breeds because historically it was believed their origins dated back more than 500 years. \n\nIn 2004, a study looked at the [[Microsatellite#Analysis of microsatellites|microsatellite]]s of 414 purebred dogs representing 85 breeds. The study found that dog breeds were so genetically distinct that 99% of individual dogs could be correctly assigned to their breed based on their [[genotype]], indicating that breeding barriers (pure-bred breeding) have led to distinct genetic units. The study identified 9 breeds that could be represented on the branches of a [[phylogenetic tree]] which grouped together with strong statistical support and could be separated from the other breeds with a modern European origin. These 9 breeds had been referred to as \"ancient breeds\". The study found that the [[Pharaoh Hound]] and [[Ibizan Hound]] were not as old as once believed; rather, they had been recreated from combinations of other breeds, and that the [[Norwegian Elkhound]] grouped with the other European dogs despite reports of direct Scandinavian origins dating back 5,000 years.<ref name=parker2004/>\n\nThe dog which accompanied the ancestors of Native Americans from Siberia is extinct.<ref name=\"Science7618\">{{cite journal |author1=M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Leathlobhair and about 50 others |title=The evolutionary history of dogs in the Americas |journal=Science |date=July 6, 2018 |volume=361 |issue=6397 |pages=81\u201385 |doi=10.1126/science.aao4776 |pmid=29976825 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"UI7518\">{{cite web |author1=Diana Yates |title=First dogs in the Americas arrived from Siberia, disappeared after European contact |url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/668925 |website=news.illinois.edu |publisher=University of Illinois |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |date=July 5, 2018 |quote=These dogs persisted for thousands of years in the Americas, but almost completely vanished after European contact, the researchers found.}}</ref>\n\n===Dog types===\n[[File:Five different types of dogs, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029217.jpg|thumb|\"Five different types of dogs\", c. 1547.]]\n\n{{further|Dog type}}\n\n[[Dog types]] are broad categories of dogs based on form, function or style of work, lineage, or appearance. In contrast, modern dog breeds are particular breed standards, sharing a common set of heritable characteristics, determined by the kennel club that recognizes the breed. \n\nThe spread of modern dog breeds has been difficult to resolve because many are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830\u20131900).<ref name=\"Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World\"/><ref name=\"American Kennel Club 2006\"/> In 2010, a study looked at 48,000&nbsp;[[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 912&nbsp;dogs representing 85&nbsp;breeds.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\">{{cite journal |first=Bridgett |last=vonHoldt |date=2010-03-17 |title=Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature08837 |pmid=20237475 |volume=464 |issue=7290 |pages=898\u2013902 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..898V |pmc=3494089 |last2=Lohmueller |first2=Kirk E. |last3=Han |first3=Eunjung |last4=Parker |first4=Heidi G. |last5=Quignon |first5=Pascale |last6=Degenhardt |first6=Jeremiah D. |last7=Boyko |first7=Adam R. |last8=Earl |first8=Dent A. |last9=Auton |first9=Adam |last10=Reynolds |first10=Andy |last11=Bryc |first11=Kasia |last12=Brisbin |first12=Abra |last13=Knowles |first13=James C. |last14=Mosher |first14=Dana S. |last15=Spady |first15=Tyrone C. |last16=Elkahloun |first16=Abdel |last17=Geffen |first17=Eli |last18=Pilot |first18=Malgorzata |last19=Jedrzejewski |first19=Wlodzimierz |last20=Greco |first20=Claudia |last21=Randi |first21=Ettore |last22=Bannasch |first22=Danika |last23=Wilton |first23=Alan |last24=Shearman |first24=Jeremy |last25=Musiani |first25=Marco |last26=Cargill |first26=Michelle |last27=Jones |first27=Paul G. |last28=Qian |first28=Zuwei |last29=Huang |first29=Wei |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe study found distinct genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to [[phenotype]] or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;\u2018ancient breeds\u2019 to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\nThe study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. \n*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,\n*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])\n*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\n===Basal breeds===\nIn 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]]. The study referred to these 16 as [[Basal (phylogenetics)|Basal]] breeds, as opposed to ancient breeds, as they exhibited genetic divergence but not all of them were historically considered to be \"ancient breeds\".<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nThe 2012 study found that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no historical or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nOf the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\n===Medical research===\nAs dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181\u20132183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Breed temperament===\nIn 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations.

Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs. Form was given a more prominent role than function.<ref name=\"Worboys 2019\">{{cite web | last=Worboys | first=Michael | title=The history of dog breeds | website=The Week | date=2019-04-13 | url=https://theweek.com/articles/832600/history-dog-breeds | access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"KC-Standard\">{{cite web | title=About Breed Standards | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/activities/dog-showing/breed-standards/about-breed-standards/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> Different types or breeds of dog were being developed by breeders who wanted to define specific characteristics and desirable features in their dogs.<ref name=\"KC-Standard\"/> Driven by dog shows and the groups that hosted them, the term dog breed took on an entirely new meaning.

Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog\u2013wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>\n\nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia. Mastiff-type dogs were kept for guarding and hunting, and short-legged dogs were also bred.<ref>Clutton-Brock, J., 1995.

In contrast, modern dog breeds are particular breed standards, sharing a common set of heritable characteristics, determined by the kennel club that recognizes the breed. \n\nThe spread of modern dog breeds has been difficult to resolve because many are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830\u20131900).<ref name=\"Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World\"/><ref name=\"American Kennel Club 2006\"/> In 2010, a study looked at 48,000&nbsp;[[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 912&nbsp;dogs representing 85&nbsp;breeds.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\">{{cite journal |first=Bridgett |last=vonHoldt |date=2010-03-17 |title=Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature08837 |pmid=20237475 |volume=464 |issue=7290 |pages=898\u2013902 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..898V |pmc=3494089 |last2=Lohmueller |first2=Kirk E. |last3=Han |first3=Eunjung |last4=Parker |first4=Heidi G. |last5=Quignon |first5=Pascale |last6=Degenhardt |first6=Jeremiah D. |last7=Boyko |first7=Adam R. |last8=Earl |first8=Dent A. |last9=Auton |first9=Adam |last10=Reynolds |first10=Andy |last11=Bryc |first11=Kasia |last12=Brisbin |first12=Abra |last13=Knowles |first13=James C. |last14=Mosher |first14=Dana S. |last15=Spady |first15=Tyrone C. |last16=Elkahloun |first16=Abdel |last17=Geffen |first17=Eli |last18=Pilot |first18=Malgorzata |last19=Jedrzejewski |first19=Wlodzimierz |last20=Greco |first20=Claudia |last21=Randi |first21=Ettore |last22=Bannasch |first22=Danika |last23=Wilton |first23=Alan |last24=Shearman |first24=Jeremy |last25=Musiani |first25=Marco |last26=Cargill |first26=Michelle |last27=Jones |first27=Paul G. |last28=Qian |first28=Zuwei |last29=Huang |first29=Wei |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe study found distinct genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to [[phenotype]] or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;\u2018ancient breeds\u2019 to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\nThe study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. \n*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,\n*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])\n*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\n===Basal breeds===\nIn 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]]. The study referred to these 16 as [[Basal (phylogenetics)|Basal]] breeds, as opposed to ancient breeds, as they exhibited genetic divergence but not all of them were historically considered to be \"ancient breeds\".<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nThe 2012 study found that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no historical or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nOf the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\n===Medical research===\nAs dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181\u20132183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Breed temperament===\nIn 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations.

Kennel Clubs maintain [[breed standard]]s, record [[Pedigree (dog)|pedigree]]s in a [[breed registry]] (or studbook), and issue the rules for [[conformation dog show]]s and trials and accreditation of judges. They often serve as [[breed registry|registries]], which are lists of adult [[purebred]] dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to purebred parents.\n\nA dog breed is represented by a sufficient number of individuals to stably transfer its specific characteristics over generations.

Four varieties of the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog]] are recognised as four distinct breeds by the [[New Zealand Kennel Club]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/pdf/breed_groups/working_standard.pdf | title=Standards of the Breeds: Group 5 \u2013 Working | publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club}}</ref> Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the [[Feist (dog)|feist]] is a hunting dog raised in the [[Southern United States]] for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other [[dog type]]s and breeds. However, the [[United Kennel Club]] recognizes one breed of feist, the [[Treeing Feist]], while the [[American Kennel Club]] does not recognize any feist breed.\n\nA dog is said to be [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed. Purebred dog breeders of today \"have inherited a breeding paradigm that is, at the very least, a bit anachronistic in light of modern genetic knowledge, and that first arose out of a pretty blatant misinterpretation of Darwin and an enthusiasm for social theories that have long been discredited as scientifically insupportable and morally questionable.\"<ref name=\"Budiansky\">{{Cite book | last =Budiansky\" | first =Stephen | publication-date =2000 | title =The Truth About Dogs; an Inquiry into the Ancestry, Social Conventions, Mental Habits, and Moral Fiber of Canis familiaris | location =New York, U.S.A. | place = | publisher =Viking Penguin | page =[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 35] | isbn =978-0-670-89272-3 | year =2000 | url =https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 }}</ref> The American Kennel Club allows [[mixed-breed dog]]s to be shown but under the condition the animals have been spayed or neutered, are not a wolf hybrid, and not eligible for the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program or an AKC Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL).<ref name=\"AKC-Mixed\">{{cite web | title=Get Started - Register Your Mixed Breed Dog With AKC Canine Partners | website=American Kennel Club | date=2019-07-28 | url=https://www.akc.org/register/information/canine-partners/get-started/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> California Assembly Act AB 1634 was a bill introduced in 2007 that would require all non-working dogs of mixed breed over the age of 6 months to be neutered or spayed.<ref name=\"ab1634\">{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025165548/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> The bill was morally controversial, leading the American Kennel Club to fight the bill.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222300/http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian department of agriculture has strict standards for the documenting of what it calls \"evolving breeds\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-11.2/FullText.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726205721/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.2/FullText.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2012 |title=Animal Pedigree Act 1985 |accessdate=9 April 2008 |work=Department of Justice, Canada }}</ref>\n\n====Breed standards====\nThe [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standard]] for each breed of dog is a detailed description of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that breed.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/about/glossary.cfm American Kennel Club Glossary]</ref> Included in the breed standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour that are considered by the breed club to be the most important for the breed, and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the breed club to be unacceptable (called ''[[Fault (dog)|faults]]'').

In both models the disks were stacked vertically on a shaft rotating at 1200 rpm.\n\nEach side of each disk has 200 tracks divided into 5 sectors. Sectors 0\u20134 were on the top surface and 5\u20139 were on the bottom surface. Each sector held either 178 or 200 characters. One to three forked-shaped access arms each contained two read/write heads, one for the top of the disk and the other for the bottom of the same disk. The access arms were mounted on a carriage alongside the disk array. During a seek operation an access arm moved, under electronic control, vertically to seek a disk 00\u201349 and then horizontally to seek a track 000\u2013199.

The 1301 stored 28 million characters (168,000,000 bits) on a single module (25 million characters with the 1410). Each module has 20 large disks and 40 recording surfaces, with 250 tracks per surface. The 1301 Model 1 has one module, the Model 2 has two modules, stacked vertically. The disks spun at 1800 rpm. Data was transferred at 90,000 characters per second.\n\nA major advance over the IBM 350 and IBM 1405 was the use of a separate arm and [[disk read-and-write head|head]] for each recording surface, with all the arms moving in and out together like a big comb. This eliminated the time needed for the arm to pull the head out of one disk and move up or down to a new disk. Seeking the desired track is also faster since, with the new design, the head will usually be somewhere in the middle of the disk, not starting on the outer edge. Maximum access time was reduced to 180 milliseconds.\n\nThe 1301 is the first disk drive to use heads that are aerodynamically designed to fly over the surface of the disk on a thin layer of air.<ref name=\"DTFirsts\" /> This allows them to be much closer to the recording surface, which greatly improves performance.\n\nThe 1301 connects to the computer via the IBM 7631 File Control. Different models of the 7631 allow the 1301 to be used with a 1410 or 7000 series computer or shared between a 7000 and a 1410 or between two 7000's.\n\nThe IBM 1301 Model 1 leased for $2,100 per month or could be purchased for $115,500. Prices for the Model 2 were $3,500 per month or $185,000 to purchase. The IBM 7631 controller cost an additional $1,185 per month or $56,000 to purchase.

The 10 individual read/write heads are mounted on a common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack is covered with a clear plastic shell and a bottom cover when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the bottom cover. Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the plastic shell lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the plastic shell, which is then removed and the drive cover closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.\n\nThere were seven models of the 1311 disk drive:\n\n# Has to be drive 1 on an [[IBM 1440]], [[IBM 1460]], or [[IBM 1240]] system.

They were used in this way on 3155/65, 3158/68, 3033, 4341, and 3081 (with special feature microcode.) The 2305 was also used for high activity small data sets such as catalogs and job queues.\n\nThe 2305-1 runs at 3.0 MB/second when attached using the 2-byte channel interface, and the larger 2305-2 runs at 1.5 MB/second.<ref name=\"IBM2305\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_2305.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 2305 fixed head storage |publisher=IBM|date= |access-date=2011-07-20}}</ref>\n\nThe 2305 provides large-scale IBM computers with fast, continuous access to small-sized quantities of information. Its capacity and high data rate make it ideal for some systems residence functions, work files, job queues, indices and data sets that are used repeatedly.<ref name=\"IBM2305\" /> Its fast response time make it attractive as a paging device in a heavily loaded systems, where there are 1.5 or more transactions per second.<ref>T.

The drive also directly attaches to the [[IBM System/360 Model 20]] and the [[IBM System/360 Model 25]].  All drives used the [[Disk pack|IBM 1316 Disk Pack]] introduced with the IBM 1311.\n\nThe 2311 Model 1 attaches to most IBM mainframes through a [[IBM 2841|2841 Control Unit]]; it attaches to the System/360 Model 25 thru a Disk Attachment Control which provides the function of the control unit. Disk packs are written in these attachments in IBM's [[Count Key Data]] variable record length format. \n\nThe [[IBM System/360 Model 20#2311 Disk Storage|2311 models 11 or 12]] are used when attached to an integrated control of the System/360 Model 20 and the disk packs are written with a fixed sector format. The disk packs are not interchangeable between those written on the Model 1 and those written on the Models 11 or 12.\n\nThe 2311 mechanism is largely identical to the 1311, but recording improvements allow higher data density. The 2311 stores 7.25&nbsp;[[megabyte]]s on a single removable IBM 1316 disk pack (the same type used on the IBM 1311) consisting of six platters that rotate as a single unit. The 2311 has ten individual read/write (R/W) heads mounted on a common actuator which moves in and out hydraulically and is mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks plus three optional tracks which could be used as alternatives in case faulty tracks were discovered. Average seek time was 85&nbsp;ms. Data transfer rate was 156&nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]/s.\n\nBecause the 2311 was to be used with a wide variety of computers within the 360 product line, its electrical interconnection was standardized. This created an opportunity for other manufacturers to sell [[plug compatible]] disk drives for use with IBM computers and an entire industry was born.\n\n===IBM 2314/2319===\n[[File:IBM2314DiskDrivesAndIBM2540CardReaderPunch.jpg|thumb|left|IBM 2314s at the University of Michigan. Note removable [[disk pack]]s and empty covers on top of the drives]]\n\n====IBM 2314====\nThe IBM 2314 Disk Access Storage Facility was introduced on April 22, 1965, one year after the [[System/360]] introduction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_2314.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 2314 direct access storage facility |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> It was used with the System/360 and the [[System/370]] lines. With the Two Channel Switch feature it could interface with two 360/370 channels. The 2314 Disk access mechanism was similar to the 2311, but further recording improvements allowed higher data density. The 2314 stored 29,176,000 characters (200\u00d720\u00d77294 bytes per track) on a single removable IBM 2316 disk pack which was similar in design to the 1316 but was taller as a result of increasing the number of disks from six to eleven. The 2316 disk pack containing the eleven {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter disks yielded 20 recording surfaces. The drive access consisted of 20 individual R/W heads mounted on a common actuator which was moved in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks. Access time was initially the same as the 2311, but later models were faster as a result of improvements made in the hydraulic actuator. Data transfer rate was doubled to 310&nbsp;kB/s.\n\nThe original Model 1 consists of the 2314 control unit, a 2312 single drive module, and two 2313 four drive modules for a total of nine disk drives bundled together with one price. The drives are mounted in individual drawers that are unlatched and pulled out to access the disk pack. Because of their appearance they acquired the nickname of \"Pizza Ovens\".  Only eight drives of the nine are available to the computer at any one time. The ninth drive is there for a spare for the user and can also be worked on \"offline\" by a Field Engineer while the other drives are in use by the customer. Each drive's system address is determined in part by a user-swappable plug, one such plug denoting a spare drive not system accessible. This permits physically changing the address of a drive by changing the plug.\n\nA 2844 Control Unit can be added to the 2314 Control Unit which allows two S/360 Channels simultaneous access to two separate disk drives in the Storage Facility.\n\nOther 2314 models came later:\n\n====IBM 2318====\n* A 2318 two drive module was announced as part of unbundling the original product allowing attachment of one to nine drives to an unbundled 2314 Model A Storage Control Unit.\n\n====IBM 2319====\n* In a response to competition from [[Plug compatible|plug compatible manufacturers]] of 2314 equivalent storage subsystems, IBM beginning 1970 introduced a series of low priced three drive module 2319s which were manufactured by removing one module from the four drive module 2313, rebranding it as a 2319 A1 and offering it at a substantially reduced rental price.  This had the effect of lowering the rental price to new customers while keeping the high rental price on existing customers.  The 2319-A1 attaches to integrated controllers for only the System/370 Models 135 and 145. Conventional 2314 DASD such as the 2312 or 2318 can attach to the 2319-A1 \n* 2319 B series of three disk drives modules allow three, six or nine drive attachment to a new 2314 Model B Storage Control Unit.\n\n===IBM 3310===\nIBM introduced the IBM 3310 Direct Access Storage Device on January 30, 1979 for [[IBM 4300|IBM 4331]] [[midrange computer]]s.<ref name=h3310>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3310.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3310 direct access storage |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Each drive has a capacity of 64.5MB.    The 3310 was a [[fixed block architecture]] device, used on [[VSE (operating system)|DOS/VSE]] and [[VM (operating system)|VM]], the only S/370 operating systems that supports FBA devices.\n\n===IBM 3330===\n[[File:IBM magnetic disk drives 3330+3333.png|thumb|300px|right|3D artist's concept of an IBM 3330 Direct Access Storage Facility.

Its removable disk packs hold 100&nbsp;MB (404\u00d719\u00d713,030 bytes) (the 1973 Model 11 featured IBM 3336-11 Disk Packs that hold 200&nbsp;MB (808x19x13,030 bytes)). Access time is 30&nbsp;ms and data transfers at 806&nbsp;kB/s. A major advance introduced with the 3330 is the use of [[error correction]], which makes the drives more reliable and reduced costs because small imperfections in the disk surface can be tolerated. The circuitry can correct error bursts up to 11 bits long through use of [[Burst error-correcting code#Fire codes|Fire codes]].\n\n====IBM 3333====\nThe 3333-1 and the 3333-11 contain two 3330 type drives and a controller that attach to a [[History of IBM CKD Controllers#Director type storage controls|director type storage control]]  Up to three additional 3330 type DASD (six drives) can then be attached to a 3333.\n\nThe 3330 was withdrawn in 1983.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3330.html\n | title = IBM 3330 data storage\n | accessdate = 2014-01-02\n | publisher = [[IBM]]\n}}</ref>\n\n===IBM 3340===\nThe IBM 3340 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named ''Winchester'', was introduced in March 1973 for use with IBM [[System/370]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3340.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3340 direct access storage facility |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> Three models were announced, the 3340-A2 with two drives and a controller, the models B2 (two drives) and B1 (one drive). B-units can connect to the model A2 to a maximum of eight drives.\n\nIt uses removable data modules that included the head and arm assembly; an access door of the data module opens or closes during a mechanical load/unload process to connect the data module to the drive; unlike previous disk packs and cartridges there is no cover to remove during the insertion process. Access time is 25 millisecond and data transfers at 885&nbsp;kB/s. Three versions of the removable IBM 3348 Data Module were sold, one with 35 megabyte capacity, another with 70 megabytes, the third also has 70 megabytes, of which 500 kilobytes were accessible with fixed heads for faster access. The 3340 also uses [[error correction]]. It was withdrawn in 1984.\n\nThe 3340 was developed in San Jose under the leadership of Ken Haughton. Early on the design was focused on two removable 30 megabyte modules. Because of this 30/30 configuration, the code name ''Winchester'' was selected after the famous [[Winchester Model 1894|Winchester .30-30 rifle]];<ref>{{cite web\n |url= https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3340.html\n |title= IBM 3340 direct access storage facility\n |accessdate=2017-06-12\n |work = IBM Archives\n |publisher = IBM\n |quote = Kenneth E. Haughton, who led the 3340 development effort, is reported to have said: 'If it's a 30-30, then it must be a Winchester.'}}</ref> subsequently the capacities were increased, but the code name stuck.\n\nThe most significant aspect of this product, and the reason that disk drives in general became known as \"Winchester technology\", was that this was IBM's first drive to not unload the heads from the media. The Winchester technology allowed the head to land and take off from the disk media as the disk spun up and down. This resulted in very significant savings and a large reduction of complexity of the head and arm actuating mechanism. This rapidly became a standard design within the disk manufacturing community.\n\nUp into the early 1990s the term ''Winchester'' or ''Winnie'' was used for hard disk drives in general long after the introduction of the 3340, but is no longer in common use in most parts of the world.\n\n===IBM 3350===\nThe IBM 3350 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named ''Madrid'', was introduced in 1975 for use with [[IBM System/370]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3350.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3350 direct access storage |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> Its non-removable head-disk assemblies (HDAs) are sealed and included the head and arm assembly. The 3350 disk geometry is 555 cylinders, 30 heads, and 19,069 bytes per track, which give each HDA a storage capacity of 317,498,850 bytes. Sealed HDAs were standard practice on all IBM DASD hereafter.\n\nDisk units are identified as Models A2, A2F, B2, B2F, C2, and C2F with each model containing two HDAs. The models are installed in strings of units with an A2 or A2F unit required and attached to a storage control such as the IBM 3830 Model 2 or the equivalent integrated storage control of a system unit. After the A2 can be up to 3 B2 units or up to 2 B2s and a C2. The C2 unit also connects to a storage control and serves as a secondary path to itself and the A2 and B2 units. When using a C2 two I/O operations could simultaneously take place on the string, one via an A2 and a second via the C2. The valid 3350 strings are: -A, -AB, -ABB, -ABBB, -AC-, -ABC-, or -ABBC- configurations.\n\nThe \"x2F\", as in Model A2F, unit is a normal x2 unit, but its two HDAs also have a Fixed Head area over the first five cylinders, thereby reducing{{Efn|Note, however, that the I/O to the fixed-head area can be delayed by a seek in progress to one of the remaining cylinders; there is no equivalent to the multiple exposures of the [[IBM 2305|2305]] fixed-head disk.}} seek time to zero for these five cylinders. This fixed head area is intended to be allocated to the frequently accessed [[Houston Automatic Spooling Priority|HASP]] or [[Job Entry Subsystem 2/3|JES2]] checkpoint area and thus greatly reduce head motion on the SPOOL device. The fixed head area can also be utilized for [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]] swap data ([[OS/360 and successors#MVT|MVT]] and [[OS/VS2 (SVS)|SVS]]) and system swap data ([[MVS]]) wherein the swap data for SVS and MVS consist of blocks of pages that have been in memory when an address space is selected for swap-out; those pages need not be contiguous and in general do not include pages that have not been modified since their last page-in. This system architecture greatly improves context switches between TSO users or batch regions.\n\nThe IBM 3350 family was withdrawn in September 1994.\n\n===IBM 3370 and 3375===\n\n====IBM 3370====\nIBM introduced the IBM 3370 Direct Access Storage Device in January 1979 for [[IBM 4300|IBM 4331]], 4341, and [[System/38]] [[midrange computer]]s.<ref name=h3370>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3370.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3370 direct access storage device |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>  It has seven fixed {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} disks, and each unit has a capacity of 571 MB.

In both models the disks were stacked vertically on a shaft rotating at 1200 rpm.\n\nEach side of each disk has 200 tracks divided into 5 sectors. Sectors 0-4 were on the top surface and 5-9 were on the bottom surface.  Each sector held either 178 or 200 characters. \nOne to three forked-shaped access arms each contained two read-write heads, one for the top of the disk and the other for the bottom of the same disk.

The 1301 stored 28 million characters (168,000,000 bits) on a single module (25 million characters with the 1410). Each module has 20 large disks and 40 recording surfaces, with 250 tracks per surface. The 1301 Model 1 has one module, the Model 2 has two modules, stacked vertically. The disks spun at 1800 rpm. Data was transferred at 90,000 characters per second.\n\nA major advance over the IBM 350 and IBM 1405 was the use of a separate arm and [[disk read-and-write head|head]] for each recording surface, with all the arms moving in and out together like a big comb. This eliminated the time needed for the arm to pull the head out of one disk and move up or down to a new disk. Seeking the desired track is also faster since, with the new design, the head will usually be somewhere in the middle of the disk, not starting on the outer edge. Maximum access time was reduced to 180 milliseconds.\n\nThe 1301 is the first disk drive to use heads that are aerodynamically designed to fly over the surface of the disk on a thin layer of air.<ref name=\"DTFirsts\" /> This allows them to be much closer to the recording surface, which greatly improves performance.\n\nThe 1301 connects to the computer via the IBM 7631 File Control. Different models of the 7631 allow the 1301 to be used with a 1410 or 7000 series computer or shared between a 7000 and a 1410 or between two 7000's.\n\nThe IBM 1301 Model 1 leased for $2,100 per month or could be purchased for $115,500. Prices for the Model 2 were $3,500 per month or $185,000 to purchase. The IBM 7631 controller cost an additional $1,185 per month or $56,000 to purchase.

They were withdrawn during the early 1970s.\n\nEach IBM 1316 Disk Pack is {{convert|4|in|mm}} high, weighs 10 pounds (4.5&nbsp;kg) and contains six {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter disks, yielding 10 recording surfaces (the outer surfaces are not used). The 10 individual read/write heads are mounted on a common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack is covered with a clear plastic shell and a bottom cover when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the bottom cover. Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the plastic shell lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the plastic shell, which is then removed and the drive cover closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.\n\nThere were seven models of the 1311 disk drive:\n\n# Has to be drive 1 on an [[IBM 1440]], [[IBM 1460]], or [[IBM 1240]] system.

It attaches to IBM mainframes via a [[IBM 2841|2841 Storage Control Unit]].\n\n=== IBM 2305 ===\nThe IBM 2305 fixed head storage (a fixed-head disk drive sometimes incorrectly called a [[Drum memory|drum]]) and associated IBM 2835 Storage Control were announced in 1970,<ref name=\"IBM2305\"/> initially to connect to the 360/85 and 360/195 using the [[IBM 2880]] [[Block Multiplexor Channel]].\n\nThe 2305 Drive was in much demand when the System 370 offered Virtual Storage, and these 2305s were often used for paging devices.  They were used in this way on 3155/65, 3158/68, 3033, 4341, and 3081 (with special feature microcode.) The 2305 was also used for high activity small data sets such as catalogs and job queues.\n\nThe 2305-1 runs at 3.0 MB/second when attached using the 2-byte channel interface, and the larger 2305-2 runs at 1.5 MB/second.<ref name=\"IBM2305\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_2305.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 2305 fixed head storage |publisher=IBM|date= |access-date=2011-07-20}}</ref>\n\nThe 2305 provides large-scale IBM computers with fast, continuous access to small-sized quantities of information. Its capacity and high data rate make it ideal for some systems residence functions, work files, job queues, indices and data sets that are used repeatedly.<ref name=\"IBM2305\" /> Its fast response time make it attractive as a paging device in a heavily loaded systems, where there are 1.5 or more transactions per second.<ref>T. Beretvas, Performance tuning in OS/VS2 MVS, IBM SYST J., Vol. 17 No. 3, 1978, p. 290-313</ref>\n\n===IBM 2311===\n[[File:IBM 2311 memory unit.JPG|thumb|right|IBM 2311 memory unit, with its six platters]]\n\nThe IBM 2311 Disk Storage Drive was introduced with the [[IBM 2841|2841 Control Unit]] in 1964 for use throughout the IBM [[System/360]]; the combination was also available on the [[IBM 1130]] and the [[IBM 1800]].  The drive also directly attaches to the [[IBM System/360 Model 20]] and the [[IBM System/360 Model 25]].  All drives used the [[Disk pack|IBM 1316 Disk Pack]] introduced with the IBM 1311.\n\nThe 2311 Model 1 attaches to most IBM mainframes through a [[IBM 2841|2841 Control Unit]]; it attaches to the System/360 Model 25 thru a Disk Attachment Control which provides the function of the control unit. Disk packs are written in these attachments in IBM's [[Count Key Data]] variable record length format. \n\nThe [[IBM System/360 Model 20#2311 Disk Storage|2311 models 11 or 12]] are used when attached to an integrated control of the System/360 Model 20 and the disk packs are written with a fixed sector format.  The disk packs are not interchangeable between those written on the Model 1 and those written on the Models 11 or 12.\n\nThe 2311 mechanism is largely identical to the 1311, but recording improvements allow higher data density. The 2311 stores 7.25&nbsp;[[megabyte]]s on a single removable IBM 1316 disk pack (the same type used on the IBM 1311) consisting of six platters that rotate as a single unit. The 2311 has ten individual read/write (R/W) heads mounted on a common actuator which moves in and out hydraulically and is mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks plus three optional tracks which could be used as alternatives in case faulty tracks were discovered. Average seek time was 85&nbsp;ms. Data transfer rate was 156&nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]/s.\n\nBecause the 2311 was to be used with a wide variety of computers within the 360 product line, its electrical interconnection was standardized. This created an opportunity for other manufacturers to sell [[plug compatible]] disk drives for use with IBM computers and an entire industry was born.\n\n===IBM 2314/2319===\n[[File:IBM2314DiskDrivesAndIBM2540CardReaderPunch.jpg|thumb|left|IBM 2314s at the University of Michigan. Note removable [[disk pack]]s and empty covers on top of the drives]]\n\n====IBM 2314====\nThe IBM 2314 Disk Access Storage Facility was introduced on April 22, 1965, one year after the [[System/360]] introduction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_2314.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 2314 direct access storage facility |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> It was used with the System/360 and the [[System/370]] lines. With the Two Channel Switch feature it could interface with two 360/370 channels. The 2314 Disk access mechanism was similar to the 2311, but further recording improvements allowed higher data density. The 2314 stored 29,176,000 characters (200\u00d720\u00d77294 bytes per track) on a single removable IBM 2316 disk pack which was similar in design to the 1316 but was taller as a result of increasing the number of disks from six to eleven. The 2316 disk pack containing the eleven {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter disks yielded 20 recording surfaces. The drive access consisted of 20 individual R/W heads mounted on a common actuator which was moved in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks. Access time was initially the same as the 2311, but later models were faster as a result of improvements made in the hydraulic actuator. Data transfer rate was doubled to 310&nbsp;kB/s.\n\nThe original Model 1 consists of the 2314 control unit, a 2312 single drive module, and two 2313 four drive modules for a total of nine disk drives bundled together with one price. The drives are mounted in individual drawers that are unlatched and pulled out to access the disk pack. Because of their appearance they acquired the nickname of \"Pizza Ovens\".  Only eight drives of the nine are available to the computer at any one time. The ninth drive is there for a spare for the user and can also be worked on \"offline\" by a Field Engineer while the other drives are in use by the customer. Each drive's system address is determined in part by a user-swappable plug, one such plug denoting a spare drive not system accessible. This permits physically changing the address of a drive by changing the plug.\n\nA 2844 Control Unit can be added to the 2314 Control Unit which allows two S/360 Channels simultaneous access to two separate disk drives in the Storage Facility.\n\nOther 2314 models came later:\n\n====IBM 2318====\n* A 2318 two drive module was announced as part of unbundling the original product allowing attachment of one to nine drives to an unbundled 2314 Model A Storage Control Unit.\n\n====IBM 2319====\n* In a response to competition from [[Plug compatible|plug compatible manufacturers]] of 2314 equivalent storage subsystems, IBM beginning 1970 introduced a series of low priced three drive module 2319s which were manufactured by removing one module from the four drive module 2313, rebranding it as a 2319 A1 and offering it at a substantially reduced rental price.  This had the effect of lowering the rental price to new customers while keeping the high rental price on existing customers.  The 2319-A1 attaches to integrated controllers for only the System/370 Models 135 and 145. Conventional 2314 DASD such as the 2312 or 2318 can attach to the 2319-A1 \n* 2319 B series of three disk drives modules allow three, six or nine drive attachment to a new 2314 Model B Storage Control Unit.\n\n===IBM 3310===\nIBM introduced the IBM 3310 Direct Access Storage Device on January 30, 1979 for [[IBM 4300|IBM 4331]] [[midrange computer]]s.<ref name=h3310>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3310.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3310 direct access storage |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Each drive has a capacity of 64.5MB.    The 3310 was a [[fixed block architecture]] device, used on [[VSE (operating system)|DOS/VSE]] and [[VM (operating system)|VM]], the only S/370 operating systems that supports FBA devices.\n\n===IBM 3330===\n[[File:IBM magnetic disk drives 3330+3333.png|thumb|300px|right|3D artist's concept of an IBM 3330 Direct Access Storage Facility.

Its removable disk packs hold 100&nbsp;MB (404\u00d719\u00d713,030 bytes) (the 1973 Model 11 featured IBM 3336-11 Disk Packs that hold 200&nbsp;MB (808x19x13,030 bytes)). Access time is 30&nbsp;ms and data transfers at 806&nbsp;kB/s. A major advance introduced with the 3330 is the use of [[error correction]], which makes the drives more reliable and reduced costs because small imperfections in the disk surface can be tolerated. The circuitry can correct error bursts up to 11 bits long through use of [[Burst error-correcting code#Fire codes|Fire codes]].\n\n====IBM 3333====\nThe 3333-1 and the 3333-11 contain two 3330 type drives and a controller that attach to a [[History of IBM CKD Controllers#Director type storage controls|director type storage control]]  Up to three additional 3330 type DASD (six drives) can then be attached to a 3333.\n\nThe 3330 was withdrawn in 1983.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3330.html\n | title = IBM 3330 data storage\n | accessdate = 2014-01-02\n | publisher = [[IBM]]\n}}</ref>\n\n===IBM 3340===\nThe IBM 3340 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named ''Winchester'', was introduced in March 1973 for use with IBM [[System/370]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3340.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3340 direct access storage facility |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>  Three models were announced, the 3340-A2 with two drives and a controller, the models B2 (two drives) and B1 (one drive). B-units can connect to the model A2 to a maximum of eight drives.\n\nIt uses removable data modules that included the head and arm assembly; an access door of the data module opens or closes during a mechanical load/unload process to connect the data module to the drive; unlike previous disk packs and cartridges there is no cover to remove during the insertion process. Access time is 25 millisecond and data transfers at 885&nbsp;kB/s. Three versions of the removable IBM 3348 Data Module were sold, one with 35 megabyte capacity, another with 70 megabytes, the third also has 70 megabytes, of which 500 kilobytes were accessible with fixed heads for faster access. The 3340 also uses [[error correction]]. It was withdrawn in 1984.\n\nThe 3340 was developed in San Jose under the leadership of Ken Haughton. Early on the design was focused on two removable 30 megabyte modules. Because of this 30/30 configuration, the code name ''Winchester'' was selected after the famous [[Winchester Model 1894|Winchester .30-30 rifle]];<ref>{{cite web\n |url= https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3340.html\n |title= IBM 3340 direct access storage facility\n |accessdate=2017-06-12\n |work = IBM Archives\n |publisher = IBM\n |quote = Kenneth E. Haughton, who led the 3340 development effort, is reported to have said: 'If it's a 30-30, then it must be a Winchester.'}}</ref> subsequently the capacities were increased, but the code name stuck.\n\nThe most significant aspect of this product, and the reason that disk drives in general became known as \"Winchester technology\", was that this was IBM's first drive to not unload the heads from the media. The Winchester technology allowed the head to land and take off from the disk media as the disk spun up and down. This resulted in very significant savings and a large reduction of complexity of the head and arm actuating mechanism. This rapidly became a standard design within the disk manufacturing community.\n\nUp into the early 1990s the term ''Winchester'' or ''Winnie'' was used for hard disk drives in general long after the introduction of the 3340, but is no longer in common use in most parts of the world.\n\n===IBM 3350===\nThe IBM 3350 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named ''Madrid'', was introduced in 1975 for use with [[IBM System/370]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3350.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3350 direct access storage |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> Its non-removable head-disk assemblies (HDAs) are sealed and included the head and arm assembly. The 3350 disk geometry is 555 cylinders, 30 heads, and 19,069 bytes per track, which give each HDA a storage capacity of 317,498,850 bytes. Sealed HDAs were standard practice on all IBM DASD hereafter.\n\nDisk units are identified as Models A2, A2F, B2, B2F, C2, and C2F with each model containing two HDAs. The models are installed in strings of units with an A2 or A2F unit required and attached to a storage control such as the IBM 3830 Model 2 or the equivalent integrated storage control of a system unit. After the A2 can be up to 3 B2 units or up to 2 B2s and a C2. The C2 unit also connects to a storage control and serves as a secondary path to itself and the A2 and B2 units. When using a C2 two I/O operations could simultaneously take place on the string, one via an A2 and a second via the C2. The valid 3350 strings are: -A, -AB, -ABB, -ABBB, -AC-, -ABC-, or -ABBC- configurations.\n\nThe \"x2F\", as in Model A2F, unit is a normal x2 unit, but its two HDAs also have a Fixed Head area over the first five cylinders, thereby reducing{{Efn|Note, however, that the I/O to the fixed-head area can be delayed by a seek in progress to one of the remaining cylinders; there is no equivalent to the multiple exposures of the [[IBM 2305|2305]] fixed-head disk.}} seek time to zero for these five cylinders. This fixed head area is intended to be allocated to the frequently accessed [[Houston Automatic Spooling Priority|HASP]] or [[Job Entry Subsystem 2/3|JES2]] checkpoint area and thus greatly reduce head motion on the SPOOL device. The fixed head area can also be utilized for [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]] swap data ([[OS/360 and successors#MVT|MVT]] and [[OS/VS2 (SVS)|SVS]]) and system swap data ([[MVS]]) wherein the swap data for SVS and MVS consist of blocks of pages that have been in memory when an address space is selected for swap-out; those pages need not be contiguous and in general do not include pages that have not been modified since their last page-in. This system architecture greatly improves context switches between TSO users or batch regions.\n\nThe IBM 3350 family was withdrawn in September 1994.\n\n===IBM 3370 and 3375===\n\n====IBM 3370====\nIBM introduced the IBM 3370 Direct Access Storage Device in January 1979 for [[IBM 4300|IBM 4331]], 4341, and [[System/38]] [[midrange computer]]s.<ref name=h3370>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3370.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 3370 direct access storage device |publisher=IBM|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>  It has seven fixed {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} disks, and each unit has a capacity of 571 MB.

The initializer, therefore, assigned a different device type than the 3990/3390.\n\n===9330 family of disk drives===\n[[File:IBM Kestrel drive (9335).jpg|thumb|right|9335 drive]]\n# 9331 Diskette Unit models 1 and 11 contained one 8-inch FDD while the models 2 and 12 contained one 5\u00bc-inch FDD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dhart.no-ip.info/iseries/9402-436%20ibm%20as400%20advanced%2036%20model%20436.htm |title=9402-436 IBM AS/400 Advanced 36 Model 436 |publisher=Dhart.no-ip.info |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>\n# 9332 Direct Access Storage Device used the IBM 0667 HDD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blingcheese.com/video-4/dasd.htm |title=IBM 9332 DASD startup and shutdown Video |publisher=Blingcheese.com |accessdate=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918005148/http://www.blingcheese.com/video-4/dasd.htm |archivedate=2011-09-18 }}</ref>\n# 9333 High Performance Disk Drive Subsystem used the IBM 0664 or IBM 0681 HDDs depending upon subsystem model\n# 9334 Disk Expansion Unit [To be determined]\n# 9335 Direct Access Storage Subsystem This HDD used in this subsystem was developed under the code name \"Kestrel\" at IBM Hursley, UK, and was an 850 MB HDD using three 14-inch disks with dual rotary actuators, each actuator accessing three surfaces with two heads per surface.<ref name=\"Case1\" /> The HDD was in the rack mountable 9335 announced as a part of the October 1986 [[IBM 9370]] Information System announcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS186-178&open&cm_mmc=5733-_-n-_-vrm_newsletter-_-10207_134134&cmibm_em=dm:0:12046832 |title=IBM 9370 INFORMATION SYSTEM OVERVIEW |publisher=01.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> There is no known OEM version of this HDD.\n# 9336 Disk Unit used the IBM 0681 HDD (Redwing)<ref name=\"DTRDD1993\">1993 Disk/Trend Report-Rigid Disk Drives, p.

Howard]]'s  [[sword and sorcery]] hero [[Conan the Barbarian]]. It was first published in trade paperback by [[Tor Books]] in December 1982, followed by a regular paperback edition in December 1983. The book was reprinted by Tor in February 1991 and September 2009. The first British edition was published by Legend in September 1996. It was later gathered together with ''[[Conan the Invincible]]'' and ''[[Conan the Unconquered]]'' into the omnibus collection ''[[The Conan Chronicles (Robert Jordan)|The Conan Chronicles]]'' (Tor Books, 1995).<ref>{{isfdb title|id=9277|title=Conan the Defender}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{long plot|date=September 2013}}\nThe book opens around noon in the mansion of Albanus the wizard, Vegentius the Commander of the Golden Leopards (the bodyguard regiment of Nemedia's Kings), Demetrio Amarianus (a landowner), \n\nThey are gathered to plot the usurping of the Dragon Throne of the kingdom of Nemedia. During their meeting, Albanus demonstrates magic to placate and wow his guests by summoning a fire elemental to destroy one of his servants. The conspirators are impressed by this and desire to have some magical devices of their own: \"As a token that [they] are all equals.\" Melius chooses a sword imbued with the skills of six master swordsmen. The sword grants its wielder sword mastery.\n\nMoving the focus of the novel to Conan, it describes how the city of Belverus in Nemedia is unsafe, the tariffs exorbitantly high, starvation rampant, sedition brewing, and King Garian's ineffectiveness as a ruler. In reality, Albanus is busy funding and controlling all the unrest in Nemedia as a means of focusing hatred on King Garian. Conan is attacked in Belverus by Melius, who it later turns out was driven insane and \"possessed\" in a fashion by the tortured spirits in the magical sword which Albania gave him. Albanus didn't know that the blade could cause such madness.\n\nConan is rescued by the town guard who find, to their horror, that they have just slain a noble.\n\nConan picks up the blade and wraps it with the hopes of selling his weapon for a few pieces of silver. Shortly thereafter, Conan meets up with Hordo, a friend of his from several previous and mostly unsuccessful quests who is now a smuggler. Hordo tries to get Conan a job as a smuggler as well, but is punished by his boss for not being cautious enough (exposing a smuggler fetches a high bounty). Hordo decides to quit his job and join Conan in his mercenary venture.\n\nHordo is often used as a foil to Conan, contrasting the intelligence of Conan to Hordo's less sophisticated thought process and abilities of perception. The pair visit a tavern where Conan's fortune is foretold by an old man. The same fortune appears on the first page of the first mass market printing. The first part of the prophecy comes true, as Conan thwarts an attempt by a lady patron of the tavern from pick pocketing him.\n\nLeaving the tavern, Conan and Hordo noticed they are being followed by what turns out to Ariane, a poet and patron at an inn called the '''Sign of Thestis'''. Suddenly, the three are attacked by an army of foot soldiers. Soon, all of the foot soldiers are slain. both Hordo and Conan spend the night at the Sign of Thestis, telling stories of their adventures. Conan learns that the patrons (including Ariane and Sephano, a sculptor) are plotting an uprising against the king along with Taras, and the mercenaries which he's hiring, to aid in his coup.\n\nConan and Hordo are soon attacked by more armed murderers. Conan realizes someone is out to kill him, though he knows not who. It turns out later to be Albanus trying to recover the magic sword and cover up all traces of it. Upon returning to the inn, Conan sells his mystical sword to Demetrio, an agent of Albanus, for fifty gold marks. Conan uses the money from his sword to start his own free-company of mercenaries and teaches them [[horse archer]] techniques unknown to the Nemedian forces.\n\nThe next time he returns to Belverus, Conan receives a message that he should meet Hordo at the '''Sign of the Full Moon'''. The patrons are worried that they may be betrayed, but Conan removes their fears by vowing he'll never betray them. At the Sign of the Full Moon, Conan is ambushed and attacked by [[assassination|assassin]]s. He is also pursued by the Belverus town guard who have also been paid off by Albanus. The message was fake.\n\nThe next day, Ariane sets up a meeting for Conan with Taras to see if Conan can be hired for the uprising. It turns out Taras is not hiring mercenaries and intends to kill Conan as per Albanus'brequest. Their attempt is thwarted and the assassins are all killed by Conan. Ariane, having followed Conan, sees the butchery and believes that Conan has betrayed them. The horse archer skills get Conan's company a job in the Nemedian [[military]] and Conan a room within the palace, much to the dismay of Vegentius the conspirator. Conan winds up practicing his sword skills with King Garian and besting Garian each time.\n\nMeanwhile, Albanus has captured Stephano the sculptor and forced him to create a likeness of King Garian. Conan is asked by the king to deliver a letter to Albanus. While at the palace, Conan sees Stephano and later tells Ariane where Stephano has gone. Ariane goes to find Stephano at the wizard's mansion, but is captured and hypnotized by Albanus. During a walk through the palace grounds, Conan and Hordo come across Vegentius wrestling with his men in tests of strength. Seeing Conan, he challenges him. Conan defeats him after long battle where the two giants trade blows that would fell a normal man. Conan now recognizes Vegentius as one of the men who plotted against the king and attempted to kill Conan in an ambush the other evening.\n\nShortly afterward, King Garian summons Conan to his throneroom. The king wants Conan to deliver a message to Lord Albanus because he must borrow money from him because the kingdom is running out of money. Conan takes this opportunity to tell him of Valentius's plans to see the king detroned. King Garian, listens to him then assures Conan how Valentius has been loyal to him and not to worry. As Conan and his free company ride through the city to leave, Hordo tells him of strange changes where people have been clearing the streets as if afraid of something or given orders to do so.\n\nConan arrives at Albanus' mansion. where he's questioned at sword point by the lord's guards of his intent. Conan grows suspicious when the guards and staff don't treat a royal messenger with hospitality. While waiting, Conan sees a drunken Stephano in the courtyard below. Furious that the gods would send Conan, the man he wanted dead, to deliver a message and taunting him, Albanus sets his plan in motion. Fortunately, Ariane breaks free from her enchantment and warns Conan about the wizard's true motives.\n\n==Reception==\nReviewer Ryan Harvey considers this, Jordan's second Conan story, \"a lesser novel\" than the first, ''[[Conan the Invincible]]'', but \"can recommend [it] as a satisfying if flawed\" entry in the series.

In these systems, the head of government is usually called prime minister, chancellor or premier. In mixed republican systems and directorial republican systems, the head of government also serves as head of state and is usually titled president.\n\n==== Full parliamentary republican systems====\nIn some full parliamentary systems, the head of state is directly elected by voters.

In these systems, the head of government is usually called prime minister, chancellor or premier. In mixed republican systems and directorial republican systems, the head of government also serves as head of state and is usually titled president.\n\n==== Full parliamentary republican systems====\nIn some full parliamentary systems, the head of state is directly elected by voters.

She is the leader in fighting Covid-19 and coming up with innovative ways to prevent the spreading. Gloves usually have separate sheaths or openings for each [[finger]] and the [[thumb]].\n\nIf there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called '''fingerless gloves'''. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]]s, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless.\n\nGloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called '''mittens'''. Mittens are warmer than other styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other; reduced surface area reduces [[heat]] loss.\n\nA hybrid of glove and mitten contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers (as in a fingerless glove, but not the thumb) and an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers. This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only, allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by [[Velcro]] or a button) to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. These hybrids are called convertible mittens or glittens, a combination of \"glove\" and \"mittens\".\n\nGloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, abrasion or chemicals, and disease; or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. [[Latex]], [[nitrile rubber]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] disposable gloves are often worn by [[health profession|health care professionals]] as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying [[evidence]] in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving [[fingerprint]]s, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting [[glove prints]], law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3740688/Police-use-glove-prints-to-catch-criminals.html|title=Police use glove prints to catch criminals|first=Patrick|last=Sawer|date=Dec 13, 2008|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> In many [[jurisdictions]] the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an [[inchoate offense]].<ref name=McCord>James W.H. McCord and Sandra L. McCord, ''Criminal Law and Procedure for the paralegal: a systems approach'', ''supra'', p. 127.</ref>\n\nFingerless gloves are useful where [[dexterity]] is required that gloves would restrict. [[Cigarette]] [[Tobacco smoking|smoker]]s and [[church building|church]] [[organist]]s often use fingerless gloves. Some gloves include a [[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]] that extends partway up the arm. [[Cycling glove]]s for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. Guitar players often use fingerless gloves in circumstances where it is too cold to play with an uncovered hand.\n\nGloves are made of materials including cloth, knitted or [[felt]]ed wool, leather, rubber, [[latex]], [[neoprene]], silk, and metal (as in [[mail (armour)|mail]]). Gloves of [[kevlar]] protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of [[pressure suit]]s and [[spacesuits]] such as the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L]] which went to the moon. Spacesuit gloves combine toughness and environmental protection with a degree of sensitivity and flexibility.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Young boxers fresco, Akrotiri, Greece.jpg|thumb|[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] youths boxing, [[Knossos]] fresco.

Strong, ''Portraits of Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I'' (Oxford) 1963:18f.</ref> The 1592 \"Ditchley\" portrait of her features her holding leather gloves in her left hand.

Makers of knitted gloves, which did not retain perfume and had less social cachet, were organised in a separate guild, of ''bonnetiers''<ref>In the earliest usage, ''bonnet'' was the woolen thread worked by hand with the needle or a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] (Boyle 1996:174).</ref> who might knit [[silk]] as well as [[wool]].

Knitted gloves were a refined handiwork that required five years of apprenticeship; defective work was subject to confiscation and burning.<ref>Boyle 1996:174</ref> In the 17th century, gloves made of soft chicken skin became fashionable. The craze for gloves called \"limericks\" took hold.

Talese/Doubleday, p. 85</ref>\n\nEmbroidered and jeweled gloves formed part of the insignia of emperors and kings.

Work-oriented white gloves are worn for activities such as gardening and cleanup; \"dress\" white gloves are worn by professionals who want a clean public appearance, such as taxi drivers, police, politicians and elevator operators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/03/19/reference/white-gloves/|title=White gloves|first=Alice|last=Gordenker|date=Mar 19, 2013|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref> However white gloves are not recommended for touching old books and similar antiquities.<ref>http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/collectioncare/publications/videos/whitegloves.pdf</ref><ref>http://content.lib.utah.edu/utils/getfile/collection/uspace/id/5214/filename/3997.pdf</ref>\n\n==Fingerless gloves==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Leather fingerless gloves.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Leather fingerless gloves]]\nFingerless gloves or \"glovelettes\" are garments worn on the hands which resemble regular gloves in most ways, except that the finger columns are half-length and opened, allowing the top-half of the wearer's fingers to be shown.\n\nFingerless gloves are often padded in the palm area, to provide protection to the hand, and the exposed fingers do not interfere with sensation or gripping. In contrast to traditional full gloves, often worn for warmth, fingerless gloves will often have a ventilated back to allow the hands to cool; this is commonly seen in [[weightlifting gloves]].\n\nFingerless gloves are worn by [[motorcyclist]]s to better grip the handlebars, as well as by [[skateboard]]ers and [[rollerblade]]rs, to protect the palms of the hands and add grip in the event of a fall. Some [[angling|angler]]s, particularly fly fishermen, favour fingerless gloves to allow manipulation of line and tackle in cooler conditions. Fingerless gloves are common among marching band members, particularly those who play the clarinet or open-hole flute, due to the difficulty of covering small holes whilst wearing gloves. The lack of fabric on the fingertips allows for better use of [[Touchscreen#Capacitive|touchscreen]]s, as on [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. Professional MMA fighters are required to wear fingerless gloves in fights.\n\n==Leather gloves==\n[[File:Gloves2.jpg|thumb|Lined black leather gloves with red leather fourchettes]]\nA '''leather glove''' is a fitted covering for the hand with a separate sheath for each [[finger]] and the [[thumb]].  This covering is composed of the tanned [[Rawhide (textile)|hide]] of an animal (with the hair removed), though in recent years it is more common for the [[leather]] to be synthetic.\n\n===Common uses===\nLeather gloves have been worn by people for thousands of years. The unique properties of leather allow for both a comfortable fit and useful grip for the wearer. The grain present on the leather and the pores present in the leather gives the gloves the unique ability to assist the wearer as they grip an object. As soft as a leather glove may be, its pores and grain provide a level of friction when \"gripped\" against an item or surface.\n\nA common use for leather gloves is sporting events.  In [[baseball]], a baseball glove is an oversized leather glove with a web used for fielding the ball.  Leather gloves are also used in [[American handball|handball]], [[cycling]], and [[American football]].\n\nEarly Formula One racing drivers used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood, necessitating the use of [[#Driving gloves|driving gloves]].<ref name=\"formula1.com\"/>\n\nLeather gloves provide protection from occupational hazards.  For example, beekeepers use leather gloves to avoid being stung by bees.  Construction workers might use leather gloves for added grip and for protecting their hands. [[Welders]] use gloves too for protection against [[electrical shocks]], extreme heat, [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]].\n\nCriminals have been known to wear leather gloves during the commission of crimes. Gloves are worn by criminals because the tactile properties of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties are the result of a grain present on the surface of the leather. The grain makes the surface of the leather unique to each glove. Investigators are able to dust for the [[glove prints]] left behind from the leather the same way in which they dust for [[fingerprint]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mitchpileggi.net/Deep_Background/resources/forensics/analysis.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713043157/http://www.mitchpileggi.net/Deep_Background/resources/forensics/analysis.htm|url-status=dead|title=Crime Labs|archivedate=Jul 13, 2012|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scienceman.org/Archives/forensics/perident.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522102440/http://scienceman.org/Archives/forensics/perident.html|url-status=dead|title=Personal Identification: Fingerprints|archivedate=May 22, 2009|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Leather dress gloves===\n\n====Main types of gloving leather====\nLeather is a natural product with special characteristics that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it is a natural product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on certain parts of the palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the [[hinge joint]]s of the wearer's hands, including the [[interphalangeal articulations of hand]], [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s, [[intercarpal articulations]], and [[wrist]]s.\n\nBecause the leather is natural as well as delicate, the wearer must take precaution as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet door knob or wiping a running nose with a gloved hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sobiloff.typepad.com/blakeblog/2006/10/held_phantom_gl.html|title=Held Phantom Glove: Initial Impressions|website=BlakeBlog|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLeather dress gloves that are worn very tight and possess very short, elasticized wrists, are most often referred to as ''cop gloves'' or ''law enforcement gloves'' because of their prevalence as issued duty gloves for many law enforcement agencies. It is common attire in [[leather subculture]] and [[BDSM]] communities.\n* Lambskin is widely used for fashion gloves and it is casual and country gloves. It is the most used material for gloves made in Europe in the known as French style..{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n* [[Cowhide]] is often used for lower-priced gloves. This leather is generally considered too thick and bulky for the majority of glove styles, particularly finer dress gloves. It is, however, used for some casual styles of glove.\n* [[Deerskin]] has the benefit of great strength and elasticity, but has a more rugged appearance, with more grain on the surface, than \"hairsheep\". It is very hard-wearing and heavier in weight.\n* [[Goatskin (material)|Goatskin]] is occasionally used for gloves. It is hard-wearing but coarser than other leathers and is normally used for cheaper gloves.\n* Hairsheep originates from sheep that grow hair, not wool. Hairsheep leather is finer and less bulky than other leathers.  Its major benefits are softness of touch, suppleness, strength, and lasting comfort. It is very durable and is particularly suited for the manufacture of dress gloves.\n* [[Peccary]] is the world\u2019s rarest and most luxurious gloving leather.  Peccary leather is very soft,  difficult to sew, and hard-wearing.<ref>Chambers, Helen G., and Verna Moulton. Clothing Selection: Fashions, Figures, Fabrics. Page 349.

It is very warm in cold weather, and as a leather reversed, it has still attached wool on the inside.\n* Slink lamb is used only in the most expensive lambskin gloves. Some of the finest lambskin comes from [[New Zealand]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Leather glove linings===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n* Cashmere is warm, light in weight, and very comfortable to wear. Cashmere yarn comes from the hair of mountain goats, whose fleece allows them to survive the extreme weather conditions they are exposed to.\n* Silk is warm in winter and cool in summer and is used both in men's and women's gloves, but is more popular in women's.\n* Wool is well known for its natural warmth and comfort, as well as having a natural elasticity.\n* Other linings, which include wool mixtures and acrylics.\n\n====Component parts====\nThe component parts that may be found in a leather dress glove are one pair of tranks, one pair of thumbs, four whole fourchettes, four half fourchettes, two gussets, and six quirks. Depending on the style of the glove there may also be roller pieces, straps, rollers, eyelets, studs, sockets and domes. Finally, linings will themselves consist of tranks, thumbs and fourchettes.\n\n====Stitching====\nThe most popular types of leather glove sewing stitches used today are:\n* Hand stitched, which is most popular in men's gloves and some women's styles. Hand stitching is a very time-consuming and skilled process.\n* Inseam, which is mainly used on women's gloves, but occasionally on men's dress gloves.\n\n====Some glove terms====\n* ''Button length'' is the measurement in inches that is used to determine the length/measurement from the base of the glove thumb to the cuff of the glove.\n* ''Fourchettes'' are the inside panels on the fingers of some glove styles.\n* ''Perforations'' are small holes that are punched in the leather. They are often added for better ventilation, grip, or aesthetics and can be as fine as a pin hole.\n* ''Points'' are the three, or sometimes single, line of decorative stitching on the back of the glove.\n* ''Quirks'' are found on only the most expensive hand sewn gloves. They are small diamond shaped pieces of leather sewn at the base of the fingers, where they are attached to the hand of the glove to improve the fit.\n* A ''strap and roller'' is used to adjust the closeness of the fit around the wrist.\n* A ''Vent'' is the 'V' shaped cut out of the glove, sometimes at the back, but more often on the palm, to give the glove an easier fit around the wrist.\n\n===Driving gloves===\n[[File:STS-118 glove damage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rick Mastracchio]]'s damaged glove during [[STS-118]]]]\n'''Driving gloves''' are designed for holding a [[steering wheel]] and transmitting the feeling of the road to the driver.

Gloves usually have separate sheaths or openings for each [[finger]] and the [[thumb]].\n\nIf there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called '''fingerless gloves'''. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]]s, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless.\n\nGloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called '''mittens'''. Mittens are warmer than other styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other; reduced surface area reduces [[heat]] loss.\n\nA hybrid of glove and mitten contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers (as in a fingerless glove, but not the thumb) and an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers. This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only, allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by [[Velcro]] or a button) to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. These hybrids are called convertible mittens or glittens, a combination of \"glove\" and \"mittens\".\n\nGloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, abrasion or chemicals, and disease; or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. [[Latex]], [[nitrile rubber]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] disposable gloves are often worn by [[health profession|health care professionals]] as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying [[evidence]] in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving [[fingerprint]]s, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting [[glove prints]], law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3740688/Police-use-glove-prints-to-catch-criminals.html|title=Police use glove prints to catch criminals|first=Patrick|last=Sawer|date=Dec 13, 2008|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> In many [[jurisdictions]] the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an [[inchoate offense]].<ref name=McCord>James W.H.

[[Cigarette]] [[Tobacco smoking|smoker]]s and [[church building|church]] [[organist]]s often use fingerless gloves. Some gloves include a [[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]] that extends partway up the arm. [[Cycling glove]]s for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. Guitar players often use fingerless gloves in circumstances where it is too cold to play with an uncovered hand.\n\nGloves are made of materials including cloth, knitted or [[felt]]ed wool, leather, rubber, [[latex]], [[neoprene]], silk, and metal (as in [[mail (armour)|mail]]). Gloves of [[kevlar]] protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of [[pressure suit]]s and [[spacesuits]] such as the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L]] which went to the moon.

Knitted gloves were a refined handiwork that required five years of apprenticeship; defective work was subject to confiscation and burning.<ref>Boyle 1996:174</ref> In the 17th century, gloves made of soft chicken skin became fashionable. The craze for gloves called \"limericks\" took hold.

In contrast to traditional full gloves, often worn for warmth, fingerless gloves will often have a ventilated back to allow the hands to cool; this is commonly seen in [[weightlifting gloves]].\n\nFingerless gloves are worn by [[motorcyclist]]s to better grip the handlebars, as well as by [[skateboard]]ers and [[rollerblade]]rs, to protect the palms of the hands and add grip in the event of a fall. Some [[angling|angler]]s, particularly fly fishermen, favour fingerless gloves to allow manipulation of line and tackle in cooler conditions. Fingerless gloves are common among marching band members, particularly those who play the clarinet or open-hole flute, due to the difficulty of covering small holes whilst wearing gloves. The lack of fabric on the fingertips allows for better use of [[Touchscreen#Capacitive|touchscreen]]s, as on [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. Professional MMA fighters are required to wear fingerless gloves in fights.\n\n==Leather gloves==\n[[File:Gloves2.jpg|thumb|Lined black leather gloves with red leather fourchettes]]\nA '''leather glove''' is a fitted covering for the hand with a separate sheath for each [[finger]] and the [[thumb]].  This covering is composed of the tanned [[Rawhide (textile)|hide]] of an animal (with the hair removed), though in recent years it is more common for the [[leather]] to be synthetic.\n\n===Common uses===\nLeather gloves have been worn by people for thousands of years. The unique properties of leather allow for both a comfortable fit and useful grip for the wearer. The grain present on the leather and the pores present in the leather gives the gloves the unique ability to assist the wearer as they grip an object. As soft as a leather glove may be, its pores and grain provide a level of friction when \"gripped\" against an item or surface.\n\nA common use for leather gloves is sporting events.  In [[baseball]], a baseball glove is an oversized leather glove with a web used for fielding the ball.  Leather gloves are also used in [[American handball|handball]], [[cycling]], and [[American football]].\n\nEarly Formula One racing drivers used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood, necessitating the use of [[#Driving gloves|driving gloves]].<ref name=\"formula1.com\"/>\n\nLeather gloves provide protection from occupational hazards.  For example, beekeepers use leather gloves to avoid being stung by bees.  Construction workers might use leather gloves for added grip and for protecting their hands. [[Welders]] use gloves too for protection against [[electrical shocks]], extreme heat, [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]].\n\nCriminals have been known to wear leather gloves during the commission of crimes. Gloves are worn by criminals because the tactile properties of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties are the result of a grain present on the surface of the leather. The grain makes the surface of the leather unique to each glove. Investigators are able to dust for the [[glove prints]] left behind from the leather the same way in which they dust for [[fingerprint]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mitchpileggi.net/Deep_Background/resources/forensics/analysis.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713043157/http://www.mitchpileggi.net/Deep_Background/resources/forensics/analysis.htm|url-status=dead|title=Crime Labs|archivedate=Jul 13, 2012|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scienceman.org/Archives/forensics/perident.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522102440/http://scienceman.org/Archives/forensics/perident.html|url-status=dead|title=Personal Identification: Fingerprints|archivedate=May 22, 2009|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Leather dress gloves===\n\n====Main types of gloving leather====\nLeather is a natural product with special characteristics that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it is a natural product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on certain parts of the palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the [[hinge joint]]s of the wearer's hands, including the [[interphalangeal articulations of hand]], [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s, [[intercarpal articulations]], and [[wrist]]s.\n\nBecause the leather is natural as well as delicate, the wearer must take precaution as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet door knob or wiping a running nose with a gloved hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sobiloff.typepad.com/blakeblog/2006/10/held_phantom_gl.html|title=Held Phantom Glove: Initial Impressions|website=BlakeBlog|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLeather dress gloves that are worn very tight and possess very short, elasticized wrists, are most often referred to as ''cop gloves'' or ''law enforcement gloves'' because of their prevalence as issued duty gloves for many law enforcement agencies. It is common attire in [[leather subculture]] and [[BDSM]] communities.\n* Lambskin is widely used for fashion gloves and it is casual and country gloves. It is the most used material for gloves made in Europe in the known as French style..{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n* [[Cowhide]] is often used for lower-priced gloves. This leather is generally considered too thick and bulky for the majority of glove styles, particularly finer dress gloves. It is, however, used for some casual styles of glove.\n* [[Deerskin]] has the benefit of great strength and elasticity, but has a more rugged appearance, with more grain on the surface, than \"hairsheep\". It is very hard-wearing and heavier in weight.\n* [[Goatskin (material)|Goatskin]] is occasionally used for gloves. It is hard-wearing but coarser than other leathers and is normally used for cheaper gloves.\n* Hairsheep originates from sheep that grow hair, not wool. Hairsheep leather is finer and less bulky than other leathers.  Its major benefits are softness of touch, suppleness, strength, and lasting comfort. It is very durable and is particularly suited for the manufacture of dress gloves.\n* [[Peccary]] is the world\u2019s rarest and most luxurious gloving leather.  Peccary leather is very soft,  difficult to sew, and hard-wearing.<ref>Chambers, Helen G., and Verna Moulton. Clothing Selection: Fashions, Figures, Fabrics. Page 349.

It is very warm in cold weather, and as a leather reversed, it has still attached wool on the inside.\n* Slink lamb is used only in the most expensive lambskin gloves. Some of the finest lambskin comes from [[New Zealand]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Leather glove linings===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n* Cashmere is warm, light in weight, and very comfortable to wear. Cashmere yarn comes from the hair of mountain goats, whose fleece allows them to survive the extreme weather conditions they are exposed to.\n* Silk is warm in winter and cool in summer and is used both in men's and women's gloves, but is more popular in women's.\n* Wool is well known for its natural warmth and comfort, as well as having a natural elasticity.\n* Other linings, which include wool mixtures and acrylics.\n\n====Component parts====\nThe component parts that may be found in a leather dress glove are one pair of tranks, one pair of thumbs, four whole fourchettes, four half fourchettes, two gussets, and six quirks. Depending on the style of the glove there may also be roller pieces, straps, rollers, eyelets, studs, sockets and domes. Finally, linings will themselves consist of tranks, thumbs and fourchettes.\n\n====Stitching====\nThe most popular types of leather glove sewing stitches used today are:\n* Hand stitched, which is most popular in men's gloves and some women's styles. Hand stitching is a very time-consuming and skilled process.\n* Inseam, which is mainly used on women's gloves, but occasionally on men's dress gloves.\n\n====Some glove terms====\n* ''Button length'' is the measurement in inches that is used to determine the length/measurement from the base of the glove thumb to the cuff of the glove.\n* ''Fourchettes'' are the inside panels on the fingers of some glove styles.\n* ''Perforations'' are small holes that are punched in the leather. They are often added for better ventilation, grip, or aesthetics and can be as fine as a pin hole.\n* ''Points'' are the three, or sometimes single, line of decorative stitching on the back of the glove.\n* ''Quirks'' are found on only the most expensive hand sewn gloves. They are small diamond shaped pieces of leather sewn at the base of the fingers, where they are attached to the hand of the glove to improve the fit.\n* A ''strap and roller'' is used to adjust the closeness of the fit around the wrist.\n* A ''Vent'' is the 'V' shaped cut out of the glove, sometimes at the back, but more often on the palm, to give the glove an easier fit around the wrist.\n\n===Driving gloves===\n[[File:STS-118 glove damage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rick Mastracchio]]'s damaged glove during [[STS-118]]]]\n'''Driving gloves''' are designed for holding a [[steering wheel]] and transmitting the feeling of the road to the driver.

Records''' is an American [[jazz]] record company and [[record label|label]] established by [[Creed Taylor]] in 1960. [[John Coltrane]] was among Impulse!'s earliest signings. Thanks to consistent sales and positive critiques of his recordings, the label came to be known as \"the house that Trane built\".<ref>Ashley Kahn (2006) ''The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records'', W.W. Norton, {{ISBN|0-393-05879-4}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nImpulse!'s parent company, [[ABC-Paramount Records]], was established in 1955 as the recording division of the American Broadcasting Company ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]). In the 1940s and 1950s, ABC benefitted from the U.S. government's [[antitrust]] actions against broadcasters and film studios who were forced to divest parts of their companies. In the early 1950s, ABC acquired the [[Blue Network]] of radio stations from [[NBC]] and later merged with the newly independent Paramount Theaters chain, formerly owned by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nThe new recording division was located at [[1501 Broadway]], above the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Times Square]].<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.15-16</ref> Under the leadership of [[Leonard Goldenson]], the former head of Paramount Pictures, the company \"sought to establish itself as a cross-media force in television, theaters and sound recordings\".<ref>Kahn, p.&nbsp;16</ref> It enjoyed early success in TV with ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', a joint venture with the [[Disney]] corporation.\n\nTo market music from the successful TV show, ABC-Paramount established the Am-Par Record Corporation and the ABC-Paramount label in early 1955, appointing Sam Clark, a Boston record distributor, as president, with Larry Newton as sales manager and Harry Levine the A&R director. The new recording company enjoyed Goldenson's full support. Sid Feller, a producer and arranger, was the first salaried employee on July 15, 1955.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.16</ref> The label achieved early success in [[pop music]] with [[Paul Anka]].\n\nIn 1960 Am-Par established a jazz subsidiary and hired [[Creed Taylor]], a producer and arranger who had worked with [[Bethlehem Records]]. Taylor became producer and A&R manager. He chose the name \"Pulse\" but then learned there was already a label with that name, so he added a prefix. In the mid-60s, Impulse!'s headquarters were moved to 1130 [[Avenue of the Americas]].<ref>Original liner notes to ''[[The October Suite]]''</ref>\n\n===Design===\nImpulse!'s albums are noted for their visual appeal. The black, orange, and white [[livery]] was devised by [[Fran Attaway]] (then known as Fran Scott), whom Taylor also credits with establishing the label's tradition of using cutting-edge photographers for its covers.<ref>[http://www.birkajazz.com/archive/impulse.htm Birka Jazz - Impulse jazz album covers]</ref> The color scheme was chosen for its brightness and because no other label used this combination.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jazztimes.com/features/the-impulse-records-story-the-house-that-trane-built/|title=The Impulse Records Story: The House That Trane Built - JazzTimes|work=JazzTimes|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe label's logo featured the Impulse! name in a heavy, sans-serif, lower-cased font, followed by an exclamation mark that mirrors the lower-case \"i\" at the beginning. For most of the 1960s, Impulse!'s album covers featured the logo in orange letters in a white circle, with black-and-orange exclamation marks above it, and the catalog number below it. One exception is the album ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', which used the design in black and white. In 1968 the circular front-cover badge was replaced by a one-color design featuring a simplified Impulse! logo and the ABC Records logo side by side within a divided rectangular border.\n\nAlbum covers often featured stylish, large-format photographs or paintings, usually in color, which were typically 'bled out' to the edges of the cover and printed on glossy laminated stock. Many of the best-known Impulse! covers were designed by art director [[Robert Flynn (graphic designer)|Robert Flynn]] and photographed by a small group that included [[Pete Turner (photographer)|Pete Turner]], who shot covers for Verve, [[A&M Records|A&M]], and [[CTI Records|CTI]]; [[Chuck Stewart]], [[Arnold Newman]], [[Ted Russell (photographer)|Ted Russell]], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090323120015/http://www.bobdylanphotobook.com/ Joe Alper], who was known for his early '60s photographs of [[Bob Dylan]]) The sparse black-and-white back covers bore the slogan, \"The New Wave of Jazz is on IMPULSE!\". Most Impulse! LPs were issued in a gatefold sleeve, with photographs and liner notes, in some cases, multi-page booklets.\n\n===Early success===\nTaylor achieved early success by signing [[Ray Charles]], who had just ended his contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Charles's ''[[Genius + Soul = Jazz]]'' gave the label its first hit and became the fourth-highest charting album of his career.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.35</ref> Other early successes included ''[[Out of the Cool]]'' by [[Gil Evans]]. Taylor also signed [[John Coltrane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-house-that-trane-built-the-story-of-impulse-records-mw0001996707|title=The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records - Various Artists {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant early release was ''[[The Blues and the Abstract Truth]]'' by [[Oliver Nelson]], who led an all-star group that featured [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Paul Chambers]], and [[Roy Haynes]]. Nelson played an important role in the label's early years before relocating to Los Angeles, where he became an arranger for film and television.\n\nTaylor left Impulse! in the summer of 1961 after being approached by MGM to become the head of [[Verve Records]].\n\n===The Thiele Years: 1961-69===\n[[Bob Thiele]], Taylor's successor, produced most of the albums in the 1960s. He had worked for [[Decca Records]] and its subsidiaries, [[Coral Records|Coral]] and [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], where his production credits included [[Alan Dale]], [[The McGuire Sisters]], [[Pearl Bailey]], and [[Theresa Brewer]], whom he married. Despite resistance from Decca executives who were suspicious of rock and roll, Thiele signed [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957.<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.63</ref>\n\nThiele's first Impulse! production was Coltrane's ''[[Live! at the Village Vanguard]]'', released in March 1962. Although unfamiliar with the \"new jazz\" movement, Thiele backed his artists, afforded them unprecedented freedom in their repertoire, and gave leading acts like Coltrane ''[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]'' in the studio. Impulse! during the Thiele years is recognized as a key outlet for [[free jazz]] and the musical movement spearheaded by Coltrane, [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Archie Shepp]], and [[McCoy Tyner]]. In addition to avant-garde releases, Thiele also produced collaborations between Coltrane and two of their mutual heroes, [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]]. Other notable performers who recorded for Impulse! during this period included [[Charles Mingus]].\n\nAided by good promotion and ABC-Paramount's well-established distribution chain, Coltrane enjoyed the highest profile and the strongest and most consistent sales of any Impulse! artist. In addition to its artistic influence, Coltrane's 1965 LP ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' became one of the most successful jazz albums ever released, selling over 100,000 copies<ref>Kahn, 2006, p.5</ref> on its first release. By 1970 it had sold more than half a million. [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[The Byrds]] has stated that he listened to Coltrane extensively in this period, and that Coltrane's saxophone playing influenced his 12-string guitar playing on the hit \"[[Eight Miles High]]\".\n\nThiele severed his ties with Impulse! in 1969, setting up a short-lived deal to provide independently-produced recordings, before leaving the label entirely to establish his own imprint, [[Flying Dutchman Records]]. Thiele's departure was in part precipitated by the breakdown of his relationship with [[Larry Newton]], the president of ABC Records.\n\nOne of Thiele's last productions was the Louis Armstrong song \"[[What A Wonderful World]]\", which Thiele co-wrote and produced for ABC's pop division shortly before Armstrong's death. Although the musicians were apparently unaware of the drama, the recording session is reported to have been the scene of a clash between Thiele and Newton. When Newton arrived at the session he became upset when he discovered that Armstrong was recording a ballad rather than a '[[Dixieland]]'-style number like his earlier hit \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello Dolly]]\". According to Thiele's own account, this led to a screaming match; Newton then had to be locked out of the studio and he stood outside throughout the session, banging on the door and yelling to be let in. The single was released with little promotion from ABC and it sold relatively poorly in the U.S.. In Europe, it sold more than 1.5 million copies and went to #1 in the UK. Demand from ABC's European distributor [[EMI]] for an album forced ABC to issue one, but they did not promote the album and it did not chart in the U.S. Twenty years later, it became the most successful recording of both Armstrong's and Thiele's careers, thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.\n\n===The 1970s===\nUnder the guidance of [[Ed Michel]], Thiele's successor, Impulse! continued to issue notable recordings, including the debut album by the [[Liberation Music Orchestra]], the first of four acclaimed collaborations between [[Charlie Haden]] and [[Carla Bley]]. The company also acquired LPs that [[Sun Ra]] had recorded for his private label, making them more widely available for the first time.\n\nIn the early 1970s ABC restructured its recording division, merging the ABC label with its other pop-rock subsidiary, [[Dunhill Records]], whose roster included [[The Mamas & the Papas]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Three Dog Night]], and [[Steely Dan]]. Impulse! was moved to share headquarters with ABC-Dunhill in [[Los Angeles]]. By this time pop-rock acts dominated the company's output, with Impulse! releases accounting for only 5 percent of total sales. It was also during this time that Impulse! became the first all-jazz label to release a rock album when it issued ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'', the second album by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], in the U.S. in 1970.\n\nIn 1974, ABC acquired the [[Famous Music]] labels and catalog from [[Gulf+Western]], and subsequently, that company's jazz recordings were incorporated into the Impulse! catalog. New recordings from the label ceased in the late 1970s, but ABC reissued titles until the company was sold to [[MCA Records]] in 1979. It is now part of [[Universal Music Group]]'s jazz holdings, [[Verve Records|The Verve Music Group]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Impulse!

Ferrell said of the divorce: \"I was the type of kid who would say, 'Hey, look at the bright side! We'll have two Christmases'.\" The divorce was amicable, and both parents were committed to their children. The biggest problem was his father's line of work. As a person in show business, his paychecks were never steady, and he  traveled from home  for months at a time.

Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the school's talent shows. He won the \"Best Personality\" superlative voted by his classmates.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} He enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]], where he studied sports broadcasting and joined the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. In college, he was known for a few pranks. On occasion, he would dress in a janitor's outfit and stroll into his friends' classes. He was also known for [[streaking]] around campus with a few other people from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} Ferrell earned an internship at a local television station in the sports department, but he did not enjoy the work.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=56}}\n\nAfter graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in sports information in 1990, he knew he did not want to do broadcasting. He took up a job as a hotel valet where, on his second day, he tore a baggage rack off the top of a van by trying to drive it under a low beam. He also worked as a teller at [[Wells Fargo]], but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not stealing the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles. He successfully auditioned for the comedy group [[The Groundlings]], where he spent time developing his [[Improvisational comedy|improvisation skills]].{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=56}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===''The Groundlings''===\n\nBefore joining The Groundlings, Ferrell's attempts at standup comedy had little success. He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was [[Harry Caray]], the [[Ford C. Frick Award|Hall of Fame]] baseball announcer. Soon he began to create original characters. With fellow Groundlings member [[Chris Kattan]], they created the Butabi Brothers, who go out to dance clubs to try to pick up women but are constantly rejected. While taking classes, Ferrell got a job at an auction house via his friend Viveca Paulin. The job was ideal as it was flexible enough for him to audition and go to rehearsals while also being employed. He received small roles, including TV series ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'' and ''[[Living Single]]'', low-budget films such as ''[[A Bucket of Blood (1995 film)|A Bucket of Blood]]'', as well as commercials. One winter, he served as a mall Santa Claus.

As a person in show business, his paychecks were never steady, and he  traveled from home  for months at a time.

Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the school's talent shows. He won the \"Best Personality\" superlative voted by his classmates.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} He enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]], where he studied sports broadcasting and joined the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity. In college, he was known for a few pranks. On occasion, he would dress in a janitor's outfit and stroll into his friends' classes. He was also known for [[streaking]] around campus with a few other people from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=55}} Ferrell earned an internship at a local television station in the sports department, but he did not enjoy the work.{{sfnp|Abbey|2007|p=56}}\n\nAfter graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in sports information in 1990, he knew he did not want to do broadcasting.

He also worked as a teller at [[Wells Fargo]], but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not stealing the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles.

He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was [[Harry Caray]], the [[Ford C. Frick Award|Hall of Fame]] baseball announcer. Soon he began to create original characters. With fellow Groundlings member [[Chris Kattan]], they created the Butabi Brothers, who go out to dance clubs to try to pick up women but are constantly rejected. While taking classes, Ferrell got a job at an auction house via his friend Viveca Paulin. The job was ideal as it was flexible enough for him to audition and go to rehearsals while also being employed. He received small roles, including TV series ''[[Grace Under Fire]]'' and ''[[Living Single]]'', low-budget films such as ''[[A Bucket of Blood (1995 film)|A Bucket of Blood]]'', as well as commercials. One winter, he served as a mall Santa Claus.
