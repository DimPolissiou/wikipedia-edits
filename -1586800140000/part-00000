The northern part of the county remains largely agricultural. Today, the county is one of the fastest-growing counties in the [[United States]].

[[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>\n\nHamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.\n\nDespite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

[[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>\n\nHamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.\n\nDespite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Daniel Corkery topped the poll under the Fianna F\u00e1il banner with a 30% share of first preference votes, followed closely by new [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] candidate and rival [[Daniel O'Leary (Fine Gael politician)|Daniel O'Leary]], taking a 27.4% share of first preferences. Quill received 4,123 first preference votes. Despite receiving only 42 less votes than he did in June of that year, his percentage share dropped to 16%. As a result of this, he only served 3 months as a TD. The number of Labour candidates was almost halved, down from 44 to 28. This has been described as an election that Labour was ill prepared for and Quill, like others, suffered from this.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mr. T. D. Keating of the IT&GWU said that it was regrettable that Quill was not re-elected. He went on to say that;\n\n''\"On all sides it was admitted that he was one of the noblest and most honest representatives sent to Dail Eireann\"'' and that ''\"it was only by a margin he was beaten on this occasion, chiefly because stronger parties were supplied with money and cars, and he had to depend on the common people who had not the wealth''. ''In spite of misrepresentation of the worst and meanest type, in spite of the fact that all the political \"big guns\" in North Cork were directed against him, it was very evident that were it not for the fact that an Independent Labour man who was already defeated in June and defeated heavily now, was a candidate, thus dividing tho Labour vote, Mr. Quill would have been elected. This Independent Labour man, who could not get elected himself, had succeeded in depriving Labour in North Cork of a representative in Dail Eireann. It was a bad day for workers and for all classes in the North Cork Constituency that Mr. Quill was defeated, and already many were regretting\".''\n\nQuill thanked those who stood by him and the Labour cause. He believed from the spirit manifested that there was no fear of the future, for truth would win out despite all misrepresentation.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nSpeaking on the heavy defeat for Labour in the September 1927 election, T. J. Murphy regretted that the party had lost men like [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Tom Johnson]], who, ''\"because of bis industry and ability, would receive a place of honour in any Parliament in tho world, and young men of tho ability and honesty of Mr. Quill, who had been defeated in North Cork by a mere handful of votes, after making a marvellous fight against a combination of influences\".''<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=http://archive.irishnewsarchive.com/Olive/APA/INA/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=EEC%2F1927%2F10%2F06&id=Ar00929&sk=27DF6453|title=Mr. T.

With 50,000-60,000 people unemployed, they and their dependents were destitute but the government did not see a role for the state in regards to job creation. He said that the government needed to raise large national loan for jobs schemes such as afforestation, roads, drainage, to support the School Attendance Act but also, the need to see to the physical well-being of students and a system of scholarships so that children had the opportunity to have access to more than primary education.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Refusal to stand (1932, 1933) ====\nQuill did not contest the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]], declining at a Convention in [[Millstreet|Millstreet, Cork]] to stand.

Examples of 'good' Labour movements were listed by public representatives such as T.J Murphy were the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], national figures such as Thomas Johnson, Cathal O'Shannon and William O'Brien were supportive of the Irish Socialist Party and the Bolshevik Revolution, but such support was rarely evident in Cork. Criticism on communist doctrine came largely from the Roman Catholic Church and prominent Catholic lay people such as Alfred O'Rahilly. The two main political parties (Fianna Fail in particular) were also constantly labelling the Labour Party as communist. The local media in particular such as The Southern Star and The Cork Examiner were equally vehement of their criticism of communist influences. However, Labour politicians, both in city and county, were critical of the Soviet Union in terms of its lack of democracy, its anti religious sentiment and that no trade union structures existed as they understood it.\n\nThe Labour Party in Cork was constantly on the defensive electorally to deny any connection with communism, which was linked with being anti-Catholic. Labour were seen as pro-communist as they were seen to attack the rights to property, they accepted the principle of class conflict and regularly criticised the capitalist system. They called for land distribution from 'ranchers' to farm labourers and the compulsory acquisition of land for house building if local farmers would not sell land. Labour meetings and public representatives regularly called for certain industries to be given state aid or be taken into public ownership while national policy also called for nationalisation of certain industries such as railways. They also recognised that there was class conflict in society which was contrary to Church social teaching and the views of other political parties. Labour figures constantly criticised the capitalist system which ''<nowiki/>'has taken control of the hearts and minds of men and has made them selfish. It has set man against man, leaving most in poverty'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Southern Star|date=18/10/1925|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLabour argued for the State to have more control of the money system, the need to establish municipal banks and they criticised the amount of money held in banks with so much poverty in both the city and the countryside. In the city, there was some initial support for the Russian Revolution, as evidenced in the use of the Soviet flag in the Cork Soviet in 1921. However, this was short lived as the preoccupation with Labour leaders in Cork focussed on trade union issues, such as employment creation, poverty, housing, education and a philosophy based on Christian social teaching. The tradition that the Labour leadership in the county came from either a trade union background (particularly the IT&GWU) and the land agitation movements such as the Land and Labour Association, which was socially Christian in nature. Some unions were also quite socially Christian in nature and influential, such as the INTO. Many of the INTO branches were affiliated to the Party in Cork and individual members also took up officerships in a number of branches. This was at a time when the Church exerted enormous amounts of influence in primary schools. INTO members were strenuously opposed to communist influence. An example of this was at the 1931 [[Cork West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork West]] selection convention. A motion from Sean O'Sullivan NT Drimoleague and John O'Sullivan NT Bantry proposed ''<nowiki/>'that the Labour Party and unions at this conference... utter detestation of any form of communism or other doctrines to our Catholic faith.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=26/10/1931|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The motion was adopted. Speaking on the motion, TJ Murphy expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'Communism was subversive to the Catholic Faith and morals and interfered with our national ideals. Labour would not exclude anti-Catholics but would not exclude accept communist or Bolshevik doctrines'<nowiki/>''. 14 Cork branches and unions including INTO branches from Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Macroom, IT&GWU branches from Dunmanway and Bandon, NUR Dunmanway and Bandon Carpenters Union reflected the widespread support for the motion. Similar sentiments were expressed at branch meetings and at political meetings in the mid 1930s, such as Quill in Leap, Murphy in Aghada and the Kilmichael and Buttevant branches. Murphy argued ''<nowiki/>'European countries are blighted by fascism or communism, forces that are filled with hatred threatening civilisation.'''<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=24/11/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnions affiliated to the Labour Party expressed similar sentiments. In 1936, the Buttevant Branch wrote to the new Bishop of Cloyne stating ''<nowiki/>'we the members of the Buttevant Branch of the Labour Party do hereby solemly affirm our beliefs in the Commandants of God and are prepared to oppose with all legitimate means at our disposal any party who may constitute themselves as propagandists for the teaching of communism in our island.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Kerryman|date=12/12/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1937, T. Moylan, NUR Mallow stated that there was no affiliation between Labour and communists and that changing the conditions of the poor did not constitute communism. The INTO Branch meeting in Kanturk passed a motion that union funding to the Labour Party should not be used to enable the Party to affiliate with Continental movements of communistic tendencies. The 1940s saw little changes in the attacks on Labour and their trenchant details on communist lines. Eileen Crowley, a candidate in the city elections in 1943 expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'we need to put in practise the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church'''. James Hickey, at a meeting in Bandon at the same time, echoed similar sentiments. When Sean McEntee of Fianna Fail attacked Labour communist tendencies at an election meeting, TJ Murphy repudiated his attacks stating that the Party supports the papal encyclicals and the laws of Catholicism to deal with the problems of the time. \n\nIn 1943, the North-West Branch met in the Butter Exchange Band room. Members felt there were misconceptions in the use of the term in the Party constitution 'Irish Workers Republic'. The Branch approved the use of the title of ''<nowiki/>'An Irish Workers Republic as laid down in the 1916 Proclamation and stated that as workers we do not need inspiration form Russia, Spain or Mexico'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=04/03/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The Irish Labour Party would recognise the right to private ownership, freedom of the press and religious liberty, the resolution concluded. The term 'Workers Republic' in the constitution was said to be problematic. It was seen by members of society and the Labour Party to be pro-Soviet. The INTO in particular were influential, both nationally and in Cork, in opposing the use of the term. They believe it went beyond Catholic social teaching and when the term was referred to the Bishops for their view, it signalled the triumph of Catholicism. The onslaught of the Church, Catholic lay speakers, the press and other political parties was too much and the Catholic ethos in the party was very strong. The right to private property and the belief that Labour was a party of public ownership had also been opposed and cost the Party support that went to Fianna Fail.\n\nThe civil and political antagonism to Labour and the threat of socialism/communism was expressed at a lecture of Corporate State by Professor Hogan of UCC I May 1934. Attended by William T. Cosgrave and many in CnaG/ FG party, the lecture was entitled 'Corporate State - An Alternative to Capitalism and Socialism'.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=03/05/1934|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Hogan deemed socialism to be a threat and the state needed an alternative which the corporate state provides, based on Christian social teaching and the removal of the issue of class politics. Socialists, he argued, sought class conflict and Irish trade unionists deny that they are Marxists, yet subscribe to the class war idea. However, Christian trade unions in Holland and Belgium were working the principles contained in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum', where capital and labour come together and co-operate successfully, he concluded.\n\nThe press offered little support, with a Cork Examiner editorial in 1947 dismissing the Labour view that capitalism was not working and that free enterprise was being replaced by monopolies. The editorial argued that communism would not deliver utopia, that the right to property was sacrosanct and that free enterprise and not state controls or monopolies was the way forward. The Labour Party fear as being seen as supporting communism or indeed being infiltrated by communists is seen in how Labour reacted to a new branch of the Party in the City.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== The Liam Mellow Branch ====\n{{Importance section|date=March 2020}}\nFrom 1935, the Party organisation had endeavoured to establish a number of branches around the city. Blarney Street was one of the areas identified by the Organisation Committee but it was not until 1943 on the initiative of Michael O'Riordan that a branch was formed there in February. A number of men involved in the Connolly Group in the Curragh joined him. The branch was named in honour of [[Liam Mellows]]. Naming a branch after someone such as Mellows was unusual for the party and the suspicion of communist influence may have been a factor in the branch being viewed with mistrust. The new branch set up meeting rooms in 16 North Main Street and in November 1943 held their inaugural meeting with then Lord Mayor, [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]], opening the meeting. Quill was elected as Chair, Bill Nagle as Vice-Chair, Michael O'Riordan as secretary, Minutes Secretary Jim Savage (whom was also a delegate to the Constituency Council) and Marie Keohane as Treasurer. A committee comprising Mrs J Hurley, Ellen Crowley B.A, Derry Kelleher, Jim Savage, Vincent Crotty, Tommy Murray (father of Labour Lord Mayor John Murray) and D.Sheehan elected.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=20/11/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The initial report seems to show that Seamus Ronayne was elected as Treasurer but Keohane appears to have acted as branch Treasurer. The Press Release issued after the first meeting stated that 40 members enrolled, that an Organising Committee set out proposed activities and its attitude to the Irish language. The title 'Craobh' rather than 'Branch' was used. Such use of the language was unusual for a Labour Party branch.\n\nThe Branch took out short advertisements for a series of public lectures, describing themselves in those as Craobh Mhaoillosa (Labour Party). The branch became active locally organising public lectures engaged with the trade unions not affiliated with the party and would send delegations to meetings of the Corporation raising issues such as housing. Many of these activities were standard for other Labour branches at the time but the Blarney Street branch appears to have been more energetic and organised in its activities. Branch established a reputation as a dynamic branch and its rapid development appears to all much to all religions organised organisational skills. The branch set up premises in 75 North Main Street premises on the site of the old Boiler Makers' Trade Union and organised a series of public lectures held in the North Main Street premises. Some of the lectures included branch members presenting talks on Liam Mellows, 'The Indian Question', 'Science and Socialism', the Irish language, 'England and the Irish Question', social security and 'The Jewish Question'.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===== Allegations of Anti-Semitism =====\nO'Riordan asserts that Quill was imposed on the Liam Mellows Branch as Chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also argued that the talk on the Jewish question arose following comments made by Timothy Quill on ''<nowiki/>'Jew Boys'''. [[Gerald Goldberg]] was present at the talk and was so impressed by O'Riordan that he subsequently donated \u00a35 to the branch. Quill, perhaps irritated by the talk demanded that the money be returned. \n\n====== 2001 Labour Party Conference ======\nO'Riordan, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, stated that ''\"I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the party' with Jewish money. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled by the party.\"''<ref>Irish Labour Party Conference (Cork, 2001)</ref>\n{{Quote|text=Following my release from the Curragh Camp and my return to Cork in 1943, I was among those who founded the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party in the hope that it might become the political voice of Irish anti-fascism in this city. I was named secretary of that branch but unfortunately the chairman we were given by the Party leadership was a Cork City Councillor who would debase the name of Labour in 1944 by a vitriolic attack on what he called \"the Jew boys\" of Cork. It was in opposition to such anti-Semitism that I insisted on giving a public lecture under the auspices of the Liam Mellows Branch on the subject of the Jewish question. A number of prominent members of Cork's Jewish community attended that public meeting and the future Lord Mayor of Cork, Gerald Goldberg, said from the floor: \"I came here to defend my people, but when I heard the lecturer I saw there was no need\".\n\nBut the anti-Semitic Labour Councillor did not give up. When Gerald Goldberg subsequently made a donation to branch funds I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the Party with Jewish money'. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled from a Party that was not prepared to support my continuing anti-fascist stand in 1944.|author=Michael O'Riordan|title=|source=Labour Party Annual Conference, 2001}}\nWhile there is merit to this claim, it does appear to be more complex than this account. Antisemitism did exist in the city at this time and Quill was a devout Catholic. Barry Desmond in his book 'No Workers Republic' testifies to the antisemitic feeling in the city at the time. There was a strong anti-communist sentiment within Labour and the party had been constantly assailed in the city by professor Alfred O'Rahilly and many figures within the Roman Church, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. The Communist Party in Eire had been disbanded but the NI party still existed. O'Riordan and Nagle attended the NI Communist Party conference in Belfast in October 1943 with four Labour members (including John De Courcey Ireland).\n\nA report in [[The Irish Press|''The'' ''Irish Press'']] suggests that the Administrative Council ''<nowiki/>'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Irish Press|date=20/04/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> This was headed up by Vice-Chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Both decisions were ratified by the annual conference that year. But there are no reports or minutes of O'Riordan being expelled by the party locally on the Jewish episode but it is likely that it played a role in the expulsions. Likewise, it is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. It was around this time that the IT&GWU disaffiliated from Labour and the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] and separate Trade Union Congress on the basis that Soviets were infiltrating the Labour Party.\n\n====== Labour vs National Labour ======\nOne incident involving the branch illustrates the divisions within the party in the city. ''The Cork Examiner'' reported in August 1944 that a deputation of three members of the Leah Mills Branch spoke at a meeting Cork Corporation on the issue of juvenile offenders in the city. They requested a commission to review the issue and that a system of 'constructive reformation' rather than prison punishment take place. After the deputation left the meeting, PJ O'Brien of the National Labour Party launched an attack on the delegation stating that these were members of the Labour Party who sought to introduce 'neo communism' into Cork. Quill, Leader of the Labour Party group in the Corporation angrily objected stating that it was false. The meeting agreed to defer the report to the next meeting.

Examples of 'good' Labour movements were listed by public representatives such as T.J Murphy were the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], national figures such as Thomas Johnson, Cathal O'Shannon and William O'Brien were supportive of the Irish Socialist Party and the Bolshevik Revolution, but such support was rarely evident in Cork. Criticism on communist doctrine came largely from the Roman Catholic Church and prominent Catholic lay people such as Alfred O'Rahilly. The two main political parties (Fianna Fail in particular) were also constantly labelling the Labour Party as communist. The local media in particular such as The Southern Star and The Cork Examiner were equally vehement of their criticism of communist influences. However, Labour politicians, both in city and county, were critical of the Soviet Union in terms of its lack of democracy, its anti religious sentiment and that no trade union structures existed as they understood it.\n\nThe Labour Party in Cork was constantly on the defensive electorally to deny any connection with communism, which was linked with being anti-Catholic. Labour were seen as pro-communist as they were seen to attack the rights to property, they accepted the principle of class conflict and regularly criticised the capitalist system. They called for land distribution from 'ranchers' to farm labourers and the compulsory acquisition of land for house building if local farmers would not sell land. Labour meetings and public representatives regularly called for certain industries to be given state aid or be taken into public ownership while national policy also called for nationalisation of certain industries such as railways. They also recognised that there was class conflict in society which was contrary to Church social teaching and the views of other political parties. Labour figures constantly criticised the capitalist system which ''<nowiki/>'has taken control of the hearts and minds of men and has made them selfish. It has set man against man, leaving most in poverty'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Southern Star|date=18/10/1925|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLabour argued for the State to have more control of the money system, the need to establish municipal banks and they criticised the amount of money held in banks with so much poverty in both the city and the countryside. In the city, there was some initial support for the Russian Revolution, as evidenced in the use of the Soviet flag in the Cork Soviet in 1921. However, this was short lived as the preoccupation with Labour leaders in Cork focussed on trade union issues, such as employment creation, poverty, housing, education and a philosophy based on Christian social teaching. The tradition that the Labour leadership in the county came from either a trade union background (particularly the IT&GWU) and the land agitation movements such as the Land and Labour Association, which was socially Christian in nature. Some unions were also quite socially Christian in nature and influential, such as the INTO. Many of the INTO branches were affiliated to the Party in Cork and individual members also took up officerships in a number of branches. This was at a time when the Church exerted enormous amounts of influence in primary schools. INTO members were strenuously opposed to communist influence. An example of this was at the 1931 [[Cork West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork West]] selection convention. A motion from Sean O'Sullivan NT Drimoleague and John O'Sullivan NT Bantry proposed ''<nowiki/>'that the Labour Party and unions at this conference... utter detestation of any form of communism or other doctrines to our Catholic faith.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=26/10/1931|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The motion was adopted. Speaking on the motion, TJ Murphy expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'Communism was subversive to the Catholic Faith and morals and interfered with our national ideals. Labour would not exclude anti-Catholics but would not exclude accept communist or Bolshevik doctrines'<nowiki/>''. 14 Cork branches and unions including INTO branches from Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Macroom, IT&GWU branches from Dunmanway and Bandon, NUR Dunmanway and Bandon Carpenters Union reflected the widespread support for the motion. Similar sentiments were expressed at branch meetings and at political meetings in the mid 1930s, such as Quill in Leap, Murphy in Aghada and the Kilmichael and Buttevant branches. Murphy argued ''<nowiki/>'European countries are blighted by fascism or communism, forces that are filled with hatred threatening civilisation.'''<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=24/11/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnions affiliated to the Labour Party expressed similar sentiments. In 1936, the Buttevant Branch wrote to the new Bishop of Cloyne stating ''<nowiki/>'we the members of the Buttevant Branch of the Labour Party do hereby solemly affirm our beliefs in the Commandants of God and are prepared to oppose with all legitimate means at our disposal any party who may constitute themselves as propagandists for the teaching of communism in our island.'<nowiki/>'' <ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Kerryman|date=12/12/1936|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1937, T. Moylan, NUR Mallow stated that there was no affiliation between Labour and communists and that changing the conditions of the poor did not constitute communism. The INTO Branch meeting in Kanturk passed a motion that union funding to the Labour Party should not be used to enable the Party to affiliate with Continental movements of communistic tendencies. The 1940s saw little changes in the attacks on Labour and their trenchant details on communist lines. Eileen Crowley, a candidate in the city elections in 1943 expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'we need to put in practise the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church'''. James Hickey, at a meeting in Bandon at the same time, echoed similar sentiments. When Sean McEntee of Fianna Fail attacked Labour communist tendencies at an election meeting, TJ Murphy repudiated his attacks stating that the Party supports the papal encyclicals and the laws of Catholicism to deal with the problems of the time. \n\nIn 1943, the North-West Branch met in the Butter Exchange Band room. Members felt there were misconceptions in the use of the term in the Party constitution 'Irish Workers Republic'. The Branch approved the use of the title of ''<nowiki/>'An Irish Workers Republic as laid down in the 1916 Proclamation and stated that as workers we do not need inspiration form Russia, Spain or Mexico'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=04/03/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The Irish Labour Party would recognise the right to private ownership, freedom of the press and religious liberty, the resolution concluded. The term 'Workers Republic' in the constitution was said to be problematic. It was seen by members of society and the Labour Party to be pro-Soviet. The INTO in particular were influential, both nationally and in Cork, in opposing the use of the term. They believe it went beyond Catholic social teaching and when the term was referred to the Bishops for their view, it signalled the triumph of Catholicism. The onslaught of the Church, Catholic lay speakers, the press and other political parties was too much and the Catholic ethos in the party was very strong. The right to private property and the belief that Labour was a party of public ownership had also been opposed and cost the Party support that went to Fianna Fail.\n\nThe civil and political antagonism to Labour and the threat of socialism/communism was expressed at a lecture of Corporate State by Professor Hogan of UCC I May 1934. Attended by William T. Cosgrave and many in CnaG/ FG party, the lecture was entitled 'Corporate State - An Alternative to Capitalism and Socialism'.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=03/05/1934|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Hogan deemed socialism to be a threat and the state needed an alternative which the corporate state provides, based on Christian social teaching and the removal of the issue of class politics. Socialists, he argued, sought class conflict and Irish trade unionists deny that they are Marxists, yet subscribe to the class war idea. However, Christian trade unions in Holland and Belgium were working the principles contained in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum', where capital and labour come together and co-operate successfully, he concluded.\n\nThe press offered little support, with a Cork Examiner editorial in 1947 dismissing the Labour view that capitalism was not working and that free enterprise was being replaced by monopolies. The editorial argued that communism would not deliver utopia, that the right to property was sacrosanct and that free enterprise and not state controls or monopolies was the way forward. The Labour Party fear as being seen as supporting communism or indeed being infiltrated by communists is seen in how Labour reacted to a new branch of the Party in the City.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== The Liam Mellow Branch ====\n{{Importance section|date=March 2020}}\nFrom 1935, the Party organisation had endeavoured to establish a number of branches around the city. Blarney Street was one of the areas identified by the Organisation Committee but it was not until 1943 on the initiative of Michael O'Riordan that a branch was formed there in February. A number of men involved in the Connolly Group in the Curragh joined him. The branch was named in honour of [[Liam Mellows]]. Naming a branch after someone such as Mellows was unusual for the party and the suspicion of communist influence may have been a factor in the branch being viewed with mistrust. The new branch set up meeting rooms in 16 North Main Street and in November 1943 held their inaugural meeting with then Lord Mayor, [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]], opening the meeting. Quill was elected as Chair, Bill Nagle as Vice-Chair, Michael O'Riordan as secretary, Minutes Secretary Jim Savage (whom was also a delegate to the Constituency Council) and Marie Keohane as Treasurer. A committee comprising Mrs J Hurley, Ellen Crowley B.A, Derry Kelleher, Jim Savage, Vincent Crotty, Tommy Murray (father of Labour Lord Mayor John Murray) and D.Sheehan elected.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=20/11/1943|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The initial report seems to show that Seamus Ronayne was elected as Treasurer but Keohane appears to have acted as branch Treasurer. The Press Release issued after the first meeting stated that 40 members enrolled, that an Organising Committee set out proposed activities and its attitude to the Irish language. The title 'Craobh' rather than 'Branch' was used. Such use of the language was unusual for a Labour Party branch.\n\nThe Branch took out short advertisements for a series of public lectures, describing themselves in those as Craobh Mhaoillosa (Labour Party). The branch became active locally organising public lectures engaged with the trade unions not affiliated with the party and would send delegations to meetings of the Corporation raising issues such as housing. Many of these activities were standard for other Labour branches at the time but the Blarney Street branch appears to have been more energetic and organised in its activities. Branch established a reputation as a dynamic branch and its rapid development appears to all much to all religions organised organisational skills. The branch set up premises in 75 North Main Street premises on the site of the old Boiler Makers' Trade Union and organised a series of public lectures held in the North Main Street premises. Some of the lectures included branch members presenting talks on Liam Mellows, 'The Indian Question', 'Science and Socialism', the Irish language, 'England and the Irish Question', social security and 'The Jewish Question'.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===== Allegations of Anti-Semitism =====\nO'Riordan asserts that Quill was imposed on the Liam Mellows Branch as Chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also argued that the talk on the Jewish question arose following comments made by Timothy Quill on ''<nowiki/>'Jew Boys'''. [[Gerald Goldberg]] was present at the talk and was so impressed by O'Riordan that he subsequently donated \u00a35 to the branch. Quill, perhaps irritated by the talk demanded that the money be returned. \n\n====== 2001 Labour Party Conference ======\nO'Riordan, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, stated that ''\"I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the party' with Jewish money. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled by the party.\"''<ref>Irish Labour Party Conference (Cork, 2001)</ref>\n{{Quote|text=Following my release from the Curragh Camp and my return to Cork in 1943, I was among those who founded the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party in the hope that it might become the political voice of Irish anti-fascism in this city. I was named secretary of that branch but unfortunately the chairman we were given by the Party leadership was a Cork City Councillor who would debase the name of Labour in 1944 by a vitriolic attack on what he called \"the Jew boys\" of Cork. It was in opposition to such anti-Semitism that I insisted on giving a public lecture under the auspices of the Liam Mellows Branch on the subject of the Jewish question. A number of prominent members of Cork's Jewish community attended that public meeting and the future Lord Mayor of Cork, Gerald Goldberg, said from the floor: \"I came here to defend my people, but when I heard the lecturer I saw there was no need\".\n\nBut the anti-Semitic Labour Councillor did not give up. When Gerald Goldberg subsequently made a donation to branch funds I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the Party with Jewish money'. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled from a Party that was not prepared to support my continuing anti-fascist stand in 1944.|author=Michael O'Riordan|title=|source=Labour Party Annual Conference, 2001}}\nWhile there is merit to this claim, it does appear to be more complex than this account. Antisemitism did exist in the city at this time and Quill was a devout Catholic. Barry Desmond in his book 'No Workers Republic' testifies to the antisemitic feeling in the city at the time. There was a strong anti-communist sentiment within Labour and the party had been constantly assailed in the city by professor Alfred O'Rahilly and many figures within the Roman Church, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. The Communist Party in Eire had been disbanded but the NI party still existed. O'Riordan and Nagle attended the NI Communist Party conference in Belfast in October 1943 with four Labour members (including John De Courcey Ireland).\n\nA report in [[The Irish Press|''The'' ''Irish Press'']] suggests that the Administrative Council ''<nowiki/>'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Irish Press|date=20/04/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> This was headed up by Vice-Chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Both decisions were ratified by the annual conference that year. But there are no reports or minutes of O'Riordan being expelled by the party locally on the Jewish episode but it is likely that it played a role in the expulsions. Likewise, it is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. It was around this time that the IT&GWU disaffiliated from Labour and the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] and separate Trade Union Congress on the basis that Soviets were infiltrating the Labour Party.\n\n====== Labour vs National Labour ======\nOne incident involving the branch illustrates the divisions within the party in the city. ''The Cork Examiner'' reported in August 1944 that a deputation of three members of the Leah Mills Branch spoke at a meeting Cork Corporation on the issue of juvenile offenders in the city. They requested a commission to review the issue and that a system of 'constructive reformation' rather than prison punishment take place. After the deputation left the meeting, PJ O'Brien of the National Labour Party launched an attack on the delegation stating that these were members of the Labour Party who sought to introduce 'neo communism' into Cork. Quill, Leader of the Labour Party group in the Corporation angrily objected stating that it was false. The meeting agreed to defer the report to the next meeting. At that meeting on 12 September 1944, the report was adopted.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The Cork Examiner|date=23/08/1944|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====== Dissolution of the Liam Mellow Branch ======\nFollowing the expulsion of O'Riordan, the Branch was dissolved and the members of the branch transferred to the Central Branch. The Branch voted for the party to reinstate both members, however, this was refused nationally.\n\n====== Retirement from electoral politics ======\nQuill did not contest the 1950 Cork Corporation election and seemingly never stood for election again. He remained involved in the co-operative movement until 1954.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Co-operative movement ==\nDuring the 1920s, Quill established the City of Cork Co-operative Society with Con Desmond (father of [[Barry Desmond]]).<ref name=\":4\" /> Quill was the secretary of the City of Cork Co-operative Society and manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. This included social enterprises such as Cooperative Tea, Cooperative Bread, Cooperative Baking Powder and Cooperative Cream.

The paper attracted the attention of Steve Denny, the director of the London Co-operative Society (England's largest co-op society at the time). In a letter to the editor, published on the cover of the June 1939 issue, Denny described the publication as a 'bright little paper'.<ref>Cork Co-Operator, June 1939, Page 1, Letter from Director of England's biggest Co-operative Society</ref> Quill frequently attended the [[Co-operative Congress|Co-Operative Congress]] in the UK throughout the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Co-Operative Congress 1939 Edition|publisher=|year=1939|isbn=|location=UK|pages=Delegates To Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Co-Operative Congress 1942 Edition|publisher=|year=1942|isbn=|location=UK|pages=Delegates To Congress}}</ref> An article from 1951 states that, inspired by [[Robert Owen]], he built cottages for the workers on his land.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A Day with 'The Cork Co-Operator' Timothy Quill|last=|first=|date=1951|work=The Evening Echo|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Quill regarded himself as a Christian Socialist.<ref name=\":3\" /> He resigned his position in the co-operative movement in 1954.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe also used an Irish language version of his name, Taig Ui Cuill, (using various spellings of his first name, including 'Taig', and 'Tadgh'), with his last name spelled as 'Ui Cuill'.

The port only has a small basin which is occasionally used to provide water to the companies located at the [[Cassella]] Industrial Park.\n* [[Frankfurt Osthafen|Osthafen]] is the biggest port in Frankfurt and almost working at full capacity. It consists of the ''Oberhafen (Upper Harbour)'' and the ''Unterhafen'' ''(Lower Harbour)'' which are separated from each other by the [[Offenbach Barrage]]. Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the ''S\u00fcdbecken'' (southern basin).\n* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Br\u00fccke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[St\u00e4del Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.\n* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] \u2014 a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreik\u00f6nigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.\n* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The neighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.\n* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.\n* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.\n* The [[H\u00f6chster Hafen]] below the [[H\u00f6chster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.\n* At the [[H\u00f6chst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[Mittlere Werksbr\u00fcck|mittlere Werksbr\u00fccke]] and the [[Leunabr\u00fccke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.\n\nCargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods.

The port only has a small basin which is occasionally used to provide water to the companies located at the [[Cassella]] Industrial Park.\n* [[Frankfurt Osthafen|Osthafen]] is the biggest port in Frankfurt and almost working at full capacity. It consists of the ''Oberhafen (Upper Harbour)'' and the ''Unterhafen'' ''(Lower Harbour)'' which are separated from each other by the [[Offenbach Barrage]]. Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the ''S\u00fcdbecken'' (southern basin).\n* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Br\u00fccke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[St\u00e4del Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.\n* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] \u2014 a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreik\u00f6nigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.\n* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The nighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.\n* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.\n* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.\n* The [[H\u00f6chster Hafen]] below the [[H\u00f6chster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.\n* At the [[H\u00f6chst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[Mittlere Werksbr\u00fcck|mittlere Werksbr\u00fccke]] and the [[Leunabr\u00fccke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.\n\nCargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods. By 2006, the figures had fallen to 5516 ships with approx. 3.5 million tonnes of goods handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/d438f2d4342749469924a1947109c1da.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> The decline in bulk goods such as coal, gravel and scrap metal plays a major role in this.

After ''[[Hit Parader]]'' editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted [[Danny Fields]], insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced [[Craig Leon]] to produce ''Ramones'', and the band recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president [[Seymour Stein]] to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques{{clarify|date=August 2019}} to those of [[the Beatles]] and used advanced production methods by Leon.\n\nThe album cover, photographed by [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']] magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in [[New York City]]. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's [[liner notes]]. After its release, ''Ramones'' was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.\n\nViolence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and [[Nazism]] were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are [[uptempo]], with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. ''Ramones'' contains a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Chris Montez]] song \"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\".\n\n''Ramones'' peaked at number 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was unsuccessful commercially, though it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine's]] list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". ''Ramones'' is considered an influential punk album in the US and UK, and had a significant impact on other genres of [[rock music]], such as [[grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

All but one of the band's 1975 gigs were booked for New York City, with [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] as the exception. After the album's recording, the Ramones headlined for very few shows, usually opening for an identified [[cover band]] which played [[Aerosmith]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. When they opened at [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], the audience appeared extremely uninterested in the Ramones so Johnny swore off playing as an introduction for other bands.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 136.</ref> Following this, Fields booked several headlining shows around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-state area]], and they began playing frequently at gigs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City. After performing with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] in New Jersey, they continued their tour to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for three shows.<ref name=\"leigh 137\"/> Leigh later said of the tour:\n\n{{Quote|Travelling was difficult. Most of the time, it was just Danny Fields, me, and the members of the band. We'd get two rooms in the hotel, three of us in each. They couldn't afford any more help at that point, so the band had to pitch in unloading the equipment. I'd play the drums during sound checks, while Tommy went out to the board and mixed the sound\u2014and instructed the soundman not to fuck with the settings. We would enlist the aid of any fan willing to help us load out at the end of the night.<ref name=\"leigh 137\">Leigh 2009, p. 137.</ref>}}\n\nAt the time, Leigh was [[road manager]], [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[chauffeur]], and head of security.

After ''[[Hit Parader]]'' editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted [[Danny Fields]], insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced [[Craig Leon]] to produce ''Ramones'', and the band recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president [[Seymour Stein]] to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques{{clarify|date=August 2019}} to those of [[the Beatles]] and used advanced production methods by Leon.\n\nThe album cover, photographed by [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']] magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in [[New York City]]. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's [[liner notes]]. After its release, ''Ramones'' was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.\n\nViolence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and [[Nazism]] were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are [[uptempo]], with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. ''Ramones'' contains a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Chris Montez]] song \"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\".\n\n''Ramones'' peaked at number 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was unsuccessful commercially, though it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine's]] list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". ''Ramones'' is considered an influential punk album in the US and UK, and had a significant impact on other genres of [[rock music]], such as [[grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The album was ranked at number 33 in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 2012 list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/ramones-ramones-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Ramones, 'Ramones' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2014.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum |url= https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ramones&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |website= RIAA.com |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]]| accessdate=2014-06-07| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QA1g5yY2|archivedate=2014-06-07| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Ramones]] began playing gigs in mid-1974, with their first show at Performance Studios in [[New York City]].<ref name= \"HallofFame\"/> The band, performing in a style similar to the one used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]], specifically [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref>Melnick & Meyer 2003, p. 33.</ref> In early 1975, [[Lisa Robinson]], an editor of ''Hit Parader'' and ''Rock Scene'', saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist [[Joey Ramone]] related that \"Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life; she started writing about us in ''Rock Scene'', and then [[Lenny Kaye]] would write about us and we started getting more press like ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\"/> Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted [[Danny Fields]], former manager of [[the Stooges]], and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band \"had everything [he] ever liked,\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\">Rombes 2005, p. 65.</ref> and became the manager in November 1975.<ref name=\"ramones 66\">Rombes 2005, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn September 19, 1975, the Ramones recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] at [[914 Sound Studios]], which was produced by [[Marty Thau]]. Featuring the songs \"[[Judy Is a Punk]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend]]\", the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels.<ref name=\"True 51\"/><ref>Porter 2004, p. 43.</ref> Producer [[Craig Leon]], who had seen the Ramones perform in the summer of 1975, brought the demo to the attention of [[Sire Records]]' president [[Seymour Stein]].<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref name=\"porter 37\"/><ref>True 2005, p. 50.</ref> After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife [[Linda S.

He brought down the vice president and all these people\u2014he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label.\"<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref>Rombes 2005, p. 67.</ref> The label offered to release \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album.

The band also used a technique known as [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]], where the vocal line used is sung twice.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\"/>\n\nRecording for the album was expanded by [[Mickey Leigh]] (Joey's brother) and Leon with percussion effects, which went unmentioned in the liner notes to the album's release.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Author Nicholas Rombes said that the production's quality sounded like \"the ultimate do-it-yourself, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk,\" but concluded that they approached the recording process with a \"high degree of preparedness and professionalism.\"<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\n[[File:Ramones back cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=An image that is primarily black and white ([[monochrome]]) photo which consists of small writing on the upper side and a bald eagle belt buckle on the bottom side.|The back cover to the Ramones album was designed by artist [[Arturo Vega]], who produced the photo of a belt buckle in a [[photo booth]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\">Rombes 2005, p. 75.</ref>]]\nInitially, the Ramones wanted an album cover similar to ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' (1964) and subsequently had pictures taken in that style by Danny Fields but Sire was dissatisfied with the results. The art direction was by Toni Wadler and, according to cartoonist [[John Holmstrom]], the \"Meet The Beatles\" cover idea came out \"horribly\".<ref name=\"Leigh 138\">Leigh 2009, p. 138.</ref> Wadler later chose a photo by Roberta Bayley, a photographer for [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'' magazine]] for the cover.

Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits.

Kobra Khan is a member of the [[The Snake Men (Masters of The Universe)|Snakemen]] and soldier in [[King Hiss]]'s army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rbmvDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA421&dq=kobra+khan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwicn_O7kuToAhUBTxUIHbxMC4AQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&q=kobra+khan&f=false|title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: A Character Guide and World Compendium Volume 1|date=May 23, 2017|publisher=Dark Horse Comics|via=Google Books}}</ref> He is a member of the Evil Warriors, and a cross between a man and a [[cobra]], who has the power to spray a 'sleep mist' from his hood which immediately renders his opponent unconscious (in some later incarnations he instead sprays poisonous venom). Although generally recognized as a member of [[Skeletor]]'s Evil Warriors, in many media he serves a dual allegiance to both Skeletor and the later introduced [[King Hiss]] of the [[Snake Men (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Men]].\n\n==Character history==\n===Original figure===\nKobra Khan was introduced into the [[Masters of the Universe]] toy line in 1984, as part of the line's third wave of figures. \nThe figure's special feature is to spray [[water]]. The figure's [[head]] is removable and the hollow [[torso]] can be filled with water, so that when the head is back in place, it can be pushed down to spray water from its [[mouth]]. The figure came with an orange version of the laser pistol that first came with the [[Zodac]] figure. \n\nThe figure was originally released with the tag-line \"Evil Master of Snakes\". Later on in the line, when the [[The Snake Men (Masters of The Universe)|Snake Men]] were introduced, later releases of Kobra Khan packaged him with the Snake Men logo, changing his tag to \"Evil Snake Men Henchman\". He was generally portrayed as a go-between between Skeletor and King Hiss. His exact loyalties sometimes varied in different versions of the franchise, but generally he was portrayed as being more aligned to Skeletor's warriors (although changing sides as it suited him). \n\n===Filmation animated series===\nAs with a number of third wave figures, Kobra Khan is incorporated into the accomanying [[Filmation]] [[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe|cartoon]] when it returned for a second season. Whereas many of the Evil Warriors were portrayed as bumbling henchmen in the Filmation version, Kobra Khan is generally portrayed in a darker, more serious manner. \n\nHe is usually paired with [[Webstor]] (another third wave figure introduced into the cartoon series around the same time) and the two of them are often seen to work as a duo. They are first paired in the episode \"Disappearing Dragons\" which portrays Khan as the leader of the two. He is portrayed as a sly, scheming and sullen character, capable of taking on numerous opponents at once with his sleep mist. [[Lou Scheimer]] voiced him with a low, whisper-like, hissing [[human voice|voice]]. \n\nIn the episode \"The Good Shall Survive\" he demonstrates the power to elongate his arms to grasp his opponent before spraying them. This ability was never mentioned before nor since, be it in the Filmation cartoon or in any other incarnation of the franchise, although to note is that a later Snake Man character, [[Sssqueeze]], had stretchable arms with which he trapped victims. Although the Snake Men were produced by Mattel too late to appear in the cartoon series (although a couple were later adapted as members of [[Evil Horde|The Horde]] for the spin-off series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]''), it is possible that the producers of the ''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' cartoon were aware of the forthcoming Sssqueeze figure and adapted the ability for Kobra Khan.\n\nThe final produced episode of the series, \"The Cold Zone\", focuses exclusively on Kobra Khan and his race, the Reptons. We learn in this episode that the Reptons inhabit a quiet underground [[monarchy|kingdom]] beneath a [[rock (geology)|stone]] [[pyramid]], and are a peaceful race who regard Khan as a [[traitor]] since he left them to join Skeletor's forces. The plot features Khan seeking the help of [[He-Man]] and his companions in relighting the [[furnace]] that heats the Reptons' kingdom, which has been extinguished by an unknown intruder. As the plot unfolds, it turns out that it was in fact Khan who extinguished the flame, and the Repton's ruler, King Pythos, has offered to grant the [[monarchy|crown]] of the Reptons to whoever can expose the guilty party. Therefore, Khan has concocted an elaborate scheme to frame He-Man for the crime so that he can become ruler of the Reptons upon exposing He-Man as guilty. \n\nOther members of the Reptons seen in this episode are King Pythos, an unnamed Chancellor, and the court jester, Scales, who reveals Khan as the true [[criminal]]. Althoguh this episode was made before the idea of the Snake Men was conceived by [[Mattel]], it can arguably be considered that the Reptons are a sub-division of the Snake Men who were permitted to remain on [[Eternia]] after defecting from the side of King Hiss.\n\n===2002 series===\n\nKobra Khan was re-used in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe toy line and cartoon series. A major change to his character is that his fangs spit acidic [[Venom (poison)|venom]] instead of sleep mist, and his figure was packaged as 'Venom Spitting Khan'. Khan seems able to vary the intensity of his venom as he sees fit; from a painful [[Irritation|irritant]], blinding opponents eyes without inflicting permanent damage, to a powerful [[acid]] that is able to instantly melt metal.\n\nHe is introduced in the episode \"Snake Pit\", in which he is presented as a dangerous criminal who escapes from the Royal Palace [[dungeon]]s after years of [[imprisonment]]. He flees to [[Snake Mountain (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Mountain]] where he pledges allegiance to Skeletor, but his real plan is to delve deep beneath Snake Mountain to find the Snake Pit, the portal to the void in which his [[ancestor]]s, King Hiss and the Snake Men, are imprisoned. His scheme is foiled by He-Man and Zodak before he can succeed, but he does manage to free General [[Rattlor]], and the two of them resurface in the final episode of the show's first season, \"Council of Evil\" Part 2 in which Khan makes a deal with [[Evil-Lyn]] that he will free her and the other Evil Warriors from the Masters' jail providing she assists him and Rattlor in freeing King Hiss. She keeps her part of the bargain, and in the episode \"Rise of the Snake Men part 1\" the Snake Men are finally released. While Khan is accepted by the Snake Men in their new conquest of Eternia, he is constantly treated with contempt by the leaders, purely because he is a [[kinship|descendant]] and not one of their original army, and also because of his smaller size. King Hiss however does seem to take a shine to Khan and seems to be quite impressed by his loyalty. \n\nKhan's personality is largely different from his 1980s incarnation. Although he still retains a portion of his independent and scheming nature, he is presented with a more youthful personality.

Although generally recognized as a member of [[Skeletor]]'s Evil Warriors, in many media he serves a dual allegiance to both Skeletor and the later introduced [[King Hiss]] of the [[Snake Men (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Men]].\n\n==Character history==\n===Original figure===\nKobra Khan was introduced into the [[Masters of the Universe]] toy line in 1984, as part of the line's third wave of figures. \nThe figure's special feature is to spray [[water]]. The figure's [[head]] is removable and the hollow [[torso]] can be filled with water, so that when the head is back in place, it can be pushed down to spray water from its [[mouth]]. The figure came with an orange version of the laser pistol that first came with the [[Zodac]] figure. \n\nThe figure was originally released with the tag-line \"Evil Master of Snakes\". Later on in the line, when the [[The Snake Men (Masters of The Universe)|Snake Men]] were introduced, later releases of Kobra Khan packaged him with the Snake Men logo, changing his tag to \"Evil Snake Men Henchman\". He was generally portrayed as a go-between between Skeletor and King Hiss. His exact loyalties sometimes varied in different versions of the franchise, but generally he was portrayed as being more aligned to Skeletor's warriors (although changing sides as it suited him). \n\n===Filmation animated series===\nAs with a number of third wave figures, Kobra Khan is incorportaed into the accomanying [[Filmation]] [[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe|cartoon]] when it returned for a second season. Whereas many of the Evil Warriors were portrayed as bumbling henchmen in the Filmation version, Kobra Khan is generally portrayed in a darker, more serious manner. \n\nHe is usually paired with [[Webstor]] (another third wave figure introduced into the cartoon series around the same time) and the two of them are often seen to work as a duo. They are first paired in the episode \"Disappearing Dragons\" which portrays Khan as the leader of the two. He is portrayed as a sly, scheming and sullen character, capable of taking on numerous opponents at once with his sleep mist. [[Lou Scheimer]] voiced him with a low, whisper-like, hissing [[human voice|voice]]. \n\nIn the episode \"The Good Shall Survive\" he demonstrates the power to elongate his arms to grasp his opponent before spraying them. This ability was never mentioned before nor since, be it in the Filmation cartoon or in any other incarnation of the franchise, although to note is that a later Snake Man character, [[Sssqueeze]], had stretchable arms with which he trapped victims. Although the Snake Men were produced by Mattel too late to appear in the cartoon series (although a couple were later adapted as members of [[Evil Horde|The Horde]] for the spin-off series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]''), it is possible that the producers of the ''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' cartoon were aware of the forthcoming Sssqueeze figure and adapted the ability for Kobra Khan.\n\nThe final produced episode of the series, \"The Cold Zone\", focuses exclusively on Kobra Khan and his race, the Reptons. We learn in this episode that the Reptons inhabit a quiet underground [[monarchy|kingdom]] beneath a [[rock (geology)|stone]] [[pyramid]], and are a peaceful race who regard Khan as a [[traitor]] since he left them to join Skeletor's forces. The plot features Khan seeking the help of [[He-Man]] and his companions in relighting the [[furnace]] that heats the Reptons' kingdom, which has been extinguished by an unknown intruder. As the plot unfolds, it turns out that it was in fact Khan who extinguished the flame, and the Repton's ruler, King Pythos, has offered to grant the [[monarchy|crown]] of the Reptons to whoever can expose the guilty party. Therefore, Khan has concocted an elaborate scheme to frame He-Man for the crime so that he can become ruler of the Reptons upon exposing He-Man as guilty. \n\nOther members of the Reptons seen in this episode are King Pythos, an unnamed Chancellor, and the court jester, Scales, who reveals Khan as the true [[criminal]]. Althoguh this episode was made before the idea of the Snake Men was conceived by [[Mattel]], it can arguably be considered that the Reptons are a sub-division of the Snake Men who were permitted to remain on [[Eternia]] after defecting from the side of King Hiss.\n\n===2002 series===\n\nKobra Khan was re-used in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe toy line and cartoon series. A major change to his character is that his fangs spit acidic [[Venom (poison)|venom]] instead of sleep mist, and his figure was packaged as 'Venom Spitting Khan'. Khan seems able to vary the intensity of his venom as he sees fit; from a painful [[Irritation|irritant]], blinding opponents eyes without inflicting permanent damage, to a powerful [[acid]] that is able to instantly melt metal.\n\nHe is introduced in the episode \"Snake Pit\", in which he is presented as a dangerous criminal who escapes from the Royal Palace [[dungeon]]s after years of [[imprisonment]]. He flees to [[Snake Mountain (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Mountain]] where he pledges allegiance to Skeletor, but his real plan is to delve deep beneath Snake Mountain to find the Snake Pit, the portal to the void in which his [[ancestor]]s, King Hiss and the Snake Men, are imprisoned. His scheme is foiled by He-Man and Zodak before he can succeed, but he does manage to free General [[Rattlor]], and the two of them resurface in the final episode of the show's first season, \"Council of Evil\" Part 2 in which Khan makes a deal with [[Evil-Lyn]] that he will free her and the other Evil Warriors from the Masters' jail providing she assists him and Rattlor in freeing King Hiss. She keeps her part of the bargain, and in the episode \"Rise of the Snake Men part 1\" the Snake Men are finally released. While Khan is accepted by the Snake Men in their new conquest of Eternia, he is constantly treated with contempt by the leaders, purely because he is a [[kinship|descendant]] and not one of their original army, and also because of his smaller size. King Hiss however does seem to take a shine to Khan and seems to be quite impressed by his loyalty. \n\nKhan's personality is largely different from his 1980s incarnation. Although he still retains a portion of his independent and scheming nature, he is presented with a more youthful personality. Khan is also rather squeamish, especially at the thought of eating victims whole like the other Snake Men, and acts like a groveling bootlicker to King Hiss, doing his best to win favor in his King's eyes and outdo his rival, General Rattlor.\n\nNonetheless, Khan appears to be a better fighter than Rattlor against the cosmic warrior, Zodak. While Rattlor is easily defeated by Zodak, Khan swiftly overpowers the cosmic warrior. Also in the episode \"Snake Pit\" he proves himself an extremely effective fighter against He-Man and the Masters.\n\n\n==Reception==\n\nKobra Khan was ranked the 5th smartest Masters of the Universe Villian by [[Screen Rant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/he-man-masters-of-the-universe-smartest-villains/|title=10 Smartest Villains In He-Man And The Masters Of The Universe, Ranked|date=March 31, 2020|website=ScreenRant}}</ref> Kobra Khan was voted No.5 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by [[Topless Robot]].<ref name=\"Topless Robot\">{{cite news|title= The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features|publisher= [[Topless Robot]]|date=|url= http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/the_12_coolest_masters_of_the_universe_action_feat.php?page=2|accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref> [[Comic Book Resources]] listed the character as He-Man: Eternia's 15 Mightiest Villains.<ref name=\"cbr.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/he-man-strongest-villains/|title=He-Man: Eternia's 15 Mightiest Villains|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Masters of the Universe}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1983]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Fictional snakes]]\n[[Category:Masters of the Universe Snake Men]]\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Masters of the Universe Evil Warriors]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: incorportaed \u2192 incorporated, Villian \u2192 Villain", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobra_Khan_(character)"}
