It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya, Dwapar, Treta and Kali.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years. When he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. The entire duration of life for the universe is: \n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

One can also compare the current age with the characteristics described for each yuga and see that Kali Yuga is the best match. \n\nSome scholars say that our present time is ascending Kali Yuga,<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BBwLVlOipyUC&pg=PA15&dq=four+yugas#v=onepage&q=four%20yugas&f=false| title=The Path to Immortality|page=15|first1= Mark L.|last1=Prophet|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Clare Prophet|author2-link=Elizabeth Clare Prophet|publisher= Summit University Press| isbn=9781932890099| year=2006}}</ref> while some other scholars say that Kali Yuga ended in 1700 CE and now we're in ascending Dwapara Yuga.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holy Science|last=Swami|first=Sri Yukeshwar Giri|publisher=Yogoda Satsang Society|year=1949|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of the four Yugas ==\nThere are four Yugas in one cycle:\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' (or Krita Yuga)\n* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\n\n=== Characteristics of each Yuga ===\n\n* '''Satya Yuga''' (\"The age of truth\" or \"[[Golden Age#Hindu|Golden Age]]\"): The first and best yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya, Dwapar, Treta and Kali.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years and when he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. \n\nThere are 360 days in Brahma's year. The entire duration of life for the universe is:\n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

Woodhull and [[Robert Townsend (spy)|Robert Townsend]] were the main agents in the Ring, alias \"Samuel Culper, Sr.\" and \"Samuel Culper, Jr.\" respectively.{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=75}}  Brewster also participated in military actions as a [[Continental Army]] officer serving under Tallmadge. \n\n[[Anna Strong (spy)|Anna Strong]]'s role in the Ring was to signal Brewster that a message was ready, according to widely accepted local and family tradition. She did this by hanging a black petticoat on her clothesline at Strong Point in Setauket, which Brewster could see from a boat in the Sound and Woodhull could see from his nearby farm.{{sfnp|Baker|2014|p=124}}{{sfnp|Nelson|2011b||p=763}}{{sfnp|Naylor|2012|p=38|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VQsKfBQhSpcC&pg=PA38]}} She would add a number of handkerchiefs for one of six coves where Brewster would bring his boat and Woodhull would meet him.<ref>Hunter, 2013, p. 42.</ref>{{sfnp|Owen|2002|p=21}}{{sfnp|Brady|2013|p=172}}\n\nIn February 1778, Brewster sent a message of his own through the Culper channel which concerned flat-bottomed boats being built in New York which could be used to ferry troops, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] privateers being outfitted.{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=103}} On another trip, he was waiting for Woodhull in Anna Strong's back garden{{sfnp|Phelps|2013|p=529}}{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=234}} when he surprised a passing British lieutenant. Brewster pulled him off his horse and had the opportunity to capture or kill him,{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=234}} but he refrained from doing either in order to avoid drawing suspicion on Anna as a member of the Ring, and instead pretended that he and his men were thieves.{{sfnp|Phelps|2013|p=529}}{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=234}}\n\n==After the war==\nBrewster married Anne Lewis of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] after the war and moved to Fairfield with her,{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=273}} where he set up a blacksmith business.{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=278}} The couple had eight surviving children.{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=278}}\n\nIn 1793, he joined the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], predecessor of the [[United States Coast Guard]].{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=278}} He took three years off from the service because he disagreed with policies of President [[John Adams]], and he commanded the revenue cutter [[USRC Active (1812)|USRC ''Active'' (1812)]] from 1812 to 1816.{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=278}} He retired to his farm in [[Black Rock, Connecticut]].{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=278}}\n\nBrewster died February 13, 1827, aged 79, and is buried in Fairfield Cemetery.{{sfnp|Rose|2007|p=278}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nCaleb Brewster is played by [[Daniel Henshall]] in the TV series ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'', on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War]]\n*[[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Baker |first=Mark Allen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gB3CQAAQBAJ |title=Spies of Revolutionary Connecticut: From Benedict Arnold to Nathan Hale |location=Charleston, South Carolina |publisher=The History Press |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-62619-407-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Brady |first=Kevin M. |title=Culper Spy Ring |editor-last=Frank |editor-first=Lisa Tendrich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn7Dj6qUn6kC&pg=PA172 |work=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-59884-444-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Brewster |first=Caleb |url=http://www.fairfieldhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/Brewster-Caleb-MS-33.html |title=Caleb Brewster Papers, 1755-1976 |id=MS 33 |publisher=Fairfield Museum and History Center  |access-date=March 17, 2013 |ref={{sfnRef|''Caleb Brewster Papers, 1755-1976''}} }}\n* {{cite book |last=Mather |first=Frederic Gregory |url=https://archive.org/details/refugeesof1776fr00mathuoft |page=[https://archive.org/details/refugeesof1776fr00mathuoft/page/278 278] |title=The Refugees of 1776 from Long Island to Connecticut |location=Albany, New York |publisher=J.

In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that \"For Your Love\" went public, a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member.

In June, Clapton was invited to jam with [[Jimmy Page]], recording a number of tracks that would be retroactively credited to [[All-Stars (band)|The Immediate All-Stars]]. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained world fame for his playing on the influential album, ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton|Blues Breakers \u2013 John Mayall \u2013 With Eric Clapton]]'', this album was not released until he had left the band for the last time in July 1966.\n\nHaving swapped his [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Vox AC30]] amplifier for a 1960 [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Standard]] guitar and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall amplifier]], Clapton's sound and playing inspired the famous [[slogan]] \"[[Clapton is God]]\", spray-painted by an unknown admirer on a wall in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite news| first= Neil| last= McCormick| title= Just how good is Eric Clapton?| date= 24 July 2015| agency= The Telegraph| location= London| work= The Daily Telegraph| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11501274/Just-how-good-is-Eric-Clapton.html| access-date= 3 April 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171124071909/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11501274/Just-how-good-is-Eric-Clapton.html| archive-date= 24 November 2017| url-status= live}}</ref> The [[graffiti]] was captured in a now-famous photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall.

Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref> Clapton has also credited ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', the debut album of [[The Band]], and its revolutionary [[Americana]] sound as influencing his decision to leave Cream.<ref>Runtagh, J.

It also spawned the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting [[John Lennon]] to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return.<ref>Elliot J.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show.

The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood.

In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success.

In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit.

Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' contained Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]]. Clapton's voice can be heard on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', on the tracks \"[[Are You Hung Up?]]\" and \"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\".\n\n[[File:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref> Clapton has also credited [[Music From Big Pink]], the debut album of [[The Band]], and its revolutionary [[Americana]] sound as influencing his decision to leave Cream.<ref>Runtagh, J.

It also spawned the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting [[John Lennon]] to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return.<ref>Elliot J.

It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 4.</ref> During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by [[The Band]] and their 1968 album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', saying: \"What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity \u2013 or ''pseudo''-virtuosity \u2013 thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and went crazy because he could not marry her.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William |last=McKeen |title=Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology |publisher=W.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show. Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], who was an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and years later murdered his mother during a [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]]. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/>\n\n====Personal problems and early solo success====\nClapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>Marc Roberty, Chris Charlesworth (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qpvlUrpH_xoC&pg=PA67&dq=eric+clapton+DRUGS+1970s&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton] p.67. Omnibus Press, 1995</ref> Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up. He nursed a [[Substance abuse|heroin addiction]], which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrison's [[Concert for Bangladesh]] benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there, he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/> In January 1973, [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], titled the \"[[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]]\", to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton returned the favour by playing \"The Preacher\" in [[Tommy (1975 film)|Ken Russell's film version]] of the Who's ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' in 1975. His appearance in the film (performing \"Eyesight to the Blind\") is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set.<ref name=\"nxfddy\"/>\n\n[[File:Clapton and Elliman.jpg|thumb|[[Yvonne Elliman]] with Clapton promoting ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' in 1974]]\nIn 1974, Clapton started living with Boyd (they would not marry until 1979) and was no longer using heroin (although he gradually began to drink heavily).

With this band Clapton recorded ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of \"[[I Shot the Sheriff]]\" was Clapton's first number one hit and was important in bringing [[reggae]] and the music of [[Bob Marley]] to a wider audience. The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP ''[[E. C. Was Here]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Pete Prown|author2=Harvey P.

Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film. The performances at London's [[Drury Lane theatre]] heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade.

A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors' orders.

In 2006 they performed at the Highclere Castle, in aid of the Countryside Alliance, playing two set pieces of \"[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" and \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\".

The album's first track, the hit \"It's in the Way That You Use It\", appeared in the [[Tom Cruise]]\u2013[[Paul Newman]] film ''[[The Color of Money]]''. The horn-driven \"Run\" echoed Collins' \"[[Sussudio]]\" and other work, while \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and \"Miss You\" continued Clapton's more angry sound.
