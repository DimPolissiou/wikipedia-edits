He has collaborated with such artists as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Jimmy Nail]], [[Kansas (band) |Kansas]], [[Elton John]], [[Gary Numan]], [[Shakin' Stevens]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], [[Cyndi Almouzni]], and [[Bon Jovi]]. As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consists mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America but never was. The group, having seemingly given up on the UK market, only included tour dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not completely) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals, mainly by Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\"\u2014the B-side to \"Life Changes\", penned by Noone. ''Blue Rock'' was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was, however, immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 minutes) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\". The second time Queen appeared was on the show's [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Kris Allen]]. The third appearance was during the [[American Idol (season 11)|eleventh season]] on 25 and 26 April 2012, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show.

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release.

While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consists mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America but never was. The group, having seemingly given up on the UK market, only included tour dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''.

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic.

In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

See [[lieutenant]].</ref> (abbreviated '''Lt''', '''LT''', '''LT(N)''', '''Lt(N)''', '''Lieut''' and '''LEUT''', depending on nation) is a [[commissioned officer]] rank in many nations' [[navy|navies]]. It is typically the most senior of junior officer ranks. In most navies, the rank's insignia may consist of two medium gold braid stripes, the uppermost stripe featuring an [[executive curl]] in many [[Commonwealth of Nations]]; or three stripes of equal or unequal width.\n\nThe now immediately senior rank of [[lieutenant commander]] was formerly a senior naval lieutenant rank. Many navies also use a subordinate rank of [[sub-lieutenant]]. The appointment of \"first lieutenant\" in many navies is held by a senior lieutenant.\n\nA navy lieutenant ranks higher than an [[Lieutenant#Army ranks|army lieutenant]]; the navy rank of lieutenant is a [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO OF-2]] (US grade O-3) and ranks with an [[Captain (armed forces)|army captain]].\n\n==History==\nFrom at least 1580,<ref name=RNM/> the lieutenant on a ship had been the officer immediately subordinate to the captain. Before the [[English Restoration]], lieutenants were appointed by their captains, and this inevitably led to abuses and to the widespread appointment of men of insufficient qualification. In 1677, [[Samuel Pepys]], while he was [[Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty|Chief Secretary to the Admiralty]], introduced the first examination for lieutenant,<ref>J. D. Davies, ''Gentlemen and Tarpaulins'' (Oxford University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-19-820263-9}}), p. 40</ref> and thereafter their seniority was dated from the passing of this examination.\n\nA lieutenant was numbered by his seniority within the ship on which he served, so that a frigate (which was entitled to three) would have a first, a second, and a third lieutenant. A [[First-rate|first-rate ship]] was entitled to six, and they were numbered accordingly. At first, a lieutenant's commission was given only for the particular ship in which he served, but after the loss of [[HMS Wager (1739)|HMS ''Wager'']] in 1741 and the [[Wager Mutiny|subsequent mutiny]], the Royal Navy changed its policy and lieutenants were given more general commissions upon passing their examination.<ref name=RNM>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm#Lt |title=Officer Ranks in the Royal Navy  - Lieutenant |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |accessdate=2008-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015812/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm |archivedate=2014-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the early days of the naval rank, some lieutenants could be very junior indeed, while others could be on the cusp of promotion to captain; those lieutenants ranged across present-day army ranks from a second lieutenant through to a lieutenant colonel. As the rank structure of navies stabilized, and the ranks of commander, lieutenant commander, and sub-lieutenant were introduced, the rank of naval lieutenant became less wide-ranging and is today the equivalent of an army captain (NATO OF-2 or US O-3).\n\n'''Promotion'''\n\nIn the United States Navy, promotion to Lieutenant is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]] of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest that 95% of [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] should be promoted to lieutenant after serving a minimum of two years at the lower rank.\n\nIn the Royal Navy, promotion to Lieutenant is done in line with seniority. Officers are typically promoted after serving as a [[Sub-lieutenant|Sub-Lieutenant]] (OF-1) for 30 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/navy-life/shaping-your-career|title=Royal Navy Life {{!}} Shaping Your Career Progression|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n\n==Rank insignia==\n\nThe insignia of a lieutenant in many navies, including the Royal Navy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3761 |title=Uniforms and Badges of Rank - Royal Navy website |accessdate=2008-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012070139/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3761 |archivedate=2008-10-12 }}</ref> consists of two medium [[gold braid]] stripes (top stripe with loop) on a [[navy blue]] or black background.

Historically, the lieutenants in a ship were ranked in accordance with seniority, with the most senior being termed the first lieutenant and acting as the [[second-in-command]]. Although lieutenants are no longer numbered by seniority, the post of \"first lieutenant\" remains.\n\nIn minor war vessels, [[destroyer]]s and [[frigate]]s, the first lieutenant (either a lieutenant or lieutenant commander) is second in command, [[executive officer]] (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships, where a commander of the warfare specialisation is appointed as the executive officer, a first lieutenant (normally a lieutenant commander) is appointed as his deputy.

See [[lieutenant]].</ref> (abbreviated '''Lt''', '''LT''', '''LT(N)''', '''Lt(N)''', '''Lieut''' and '''LEUT''', depending on nation) is a [[commissioned officer]] rank in many nations' [[navy|navies]]. It is typically the most senior of junior officer ranks. In most navies, the rank's insignia may consist of two medium gold braid stripes, the uppermost stripe featuring an [[executive curl]] in many [[Commonwealth of Nations]]; or three stripes of equal or unequal width.\n\nThe now immediately senior rank of [[lieutenant commander]] was formerly a senior naval lieutenant rank. Many navies also use a subordinate rank of [[sub-lieutenant]]. The appointment of \"first lieutenant\" in many navies is held by a senior lieutenant.\n\nA navy lieutenant ranks higher than an [[Lieutenant#Army ranks|army lieutenant]]; the navy rank of lieutenant is a [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO OF-2]] (US grade O-3) and ranks with an [[Captain (armed forces)|army captain]].\n\n==History==\nFrom at least 1580,<ref name=RNM/> the lieutenant on a ship had been the officer immediately subordinate to the captain. Before the [[English Restoration]], lieutenants were appointed by their captains, and this inevitably led to abuses and to the widespread appointment of men of insufficient qualification. In 1677, [[Samuel Pepys]], while he was [[Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty|Chief Secretary to the Admiralty]], introduced the first examination for lieutenant,<ref>J. D. Davies, ''Gentlemen and Tarpaulins'' (Oxford University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-19-820263-9}}), p. 40</ref> and thereafter their seniority was dated from the passing of this examination.\n\nA lieutenant was numbered by his seniority within the ship on which he served, so that a frigate (which was entitled to three) would have a first, a second, and a third lieutenant. A [[First-rate|first-rate ship]] was entitled to six, and they were numbered accordingly. At first, a lieutenant's commission was given only for the particular ship in which he served, but after the loss of [[HMS Wager (1739)|HMS ''Wager'']] in 1741 and the [[Wager Mutiny|subsequent mutiny]], the Royal Navy changed its policy and lieutenants were given more general commissions upon passing their examination.<ref name=RNM>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm#Lt |title=Officer Ranks in the Royal Navy  - Lieutenant |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |accessdate=2008-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015812/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_nav_rankings.htm |archivedate=2014-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the early days of the naval rank, some lieutenants could be very junior indeed, while others could be on the cusp of promotion to captain; those lieutenants ranged across present-day army ranks from a second lieutenant through to a lieutenant colonel. As the rank structure of navies stabilized, and the ranks of commander, lieutenant commander, and sub-lieutenant were introduced, the rank of naval lieutenant became less wide-ranging and is today the equivalent of an army captain (NATO OF-2 or US O-3).\n\n'''Promotion'''\n\nIn the United States Navy, promotion to Lieutenant is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]] of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest that 95% of [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] should be promoted to lieutenant after serving a minimum of two years at the lower rank.\n\nIn the Royal Navy, promotion to Lieutenant is done in line with seniority. Officers are typically promoted after serving as a [[Sub-lieutenant|Sub-Lieutenant]] (OF-1) for 30 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/navy-life/shaping-your-career|title=Royal Navy Life {{!}} Shaping Your Career Progression|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> However, promotion may be quicker if a candidate has previous naval service and commissions from the ranks (Upper Yardsman/Senior Upper Yardsman).\n\n==Rank insignia==\n\nThe insignia of a lieutenant in many navies, including the Royal Navy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3761 |title=Uniforms and Badges of Rank - Royal Navy website |accessdate=2008-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012070139/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3761 |archivedate=2008-10-12 }}</ref> consists of two medium [[gold braid]] stripes (top stripe with loop) on a [[navy blue]] or black background.

Historically, the lieutenants in a ship were ranked in accordance with seniority, with the most senior being termed the first lieutenant and acting as the [[second-in-command]]. Although lieutenants are no longer numbered by seniority, the post of \"first lieutenant\" remains.\n\nIn minor war vessels, [[destroyer]]s and [[frigate]]s, the first lieutenant (either a lieutenant or lieutenant commander) is second in command, [[executive officer]] (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships, where a commander of the warfare specialisation is appointed as the executive officer, a first lieutenant (normally a lieutenant commander) is appointed as his deputy. The post of first lieutenant in a [[shore establishment]] carries a similar responsibility to that of the first lieutenant of a [[capital ship]].\n\nIn the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard, the billet of first lieutenant describes the officer in charge of the [[deck department]] or division, depending on the size of the ship. In smaller ships that have only a single deck division, the billet is typically filled by an ensign; while in larger ships, with a deck department consisting of multiple subordinate divisions, the billet may be filled by a lieutenant commander. On submarines and smaller Coast Guard cutters, the billet of first lieutenant may be filled by a [[petty officer]].\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|War}}}}\n* [[Comparative military ranks]]\n* [[Captain lieutenant]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{UK officer ranks}}\n{{US officer ranks|collapse=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Military ranks of the Royal Navy]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of the United States Coast Guard]]\n[[Category:Naval ranks]]\n", "name_user": "5a1amm60", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_(navy)"}

Westmoreland drew controversy after reports of a joke that was characterized as \"racist\" spread. Beverley Clark, the opponent and a Black teacher, defeated Westmoreland in that race. Bernstein said that the significant racial minority groups and the \"social tolerance\" trait may have contributed to backlash against Bernstein. In a 1989 ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' article, Randy Cypret, the president of the Houston Heights Association, said that the split vote from the Houston Heights may reflect the ethnic division. Cypret added that opposition may have stemmed from Westmoreland's lack of political presence in the Houston Heights and a lack of advocacy for zoning-related issues. Cypret said that he opposed Westmoreland because of \"the fact that he considers being on the city council a part-time job. In the fourth largest city in the country, you should take your job more seriously.\"<ref>Bernstein, Alan. \"[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1989_663585 Core of white support failed to halt Westmoreland's defeat].\" ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.

{"title_page": "List of The X Factor (American TV series) finalists", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The X Factor'' (American TV series) finalists}}\n'''''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American television]] music competition that first aired in 2011. As of December 2013, there have been three completed seasons. The final round of the competition features a number of solo singers or vocal groups: seventeen in season 1 and sixteen for season 2 and 3. A total of 49 acts have reached the finals of their season.\n\nDuring the first season the finalists were split into four groups: \"boys\", \"girls\", \"over 25s\" and \"groups\". Each set of contestants was mentored by one of the show's judges, [[Simon Cowell]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[L.A. Reid]]. In season 2, the \"boys\" and \"girls\" categories were scrapped and the \"teens\" and \"young adults\" categories were introduced. And the \"over 25s\" were still the same as season 1. Also in season 2, Abdul and Scherzinger left the show, leaving Cowell and Reid as the only two judges to return from the previous year. Cowell and Reid were joined on the panel by [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Britney Spears]]. In season 3, Reid and Spears left the show, Cowell and Lovato returned as judges from the previous year. [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Paulina Rubio]] joined the panel as replacements of Reid and Spears. The \"boys\" and \"girls\" categories were reintroduced in season 3, replacing the \"teens\" and \"young adults\" categories from the previous year.\n\nAs of season 3, only three categories have won the show on at least one occasion, while two of the show's eight judges have had the winning act in their category at least once, with Cowell winning twice, and Reid winning on one occasion. The judges not to win were Abdul, Lovato, Rowland, Rubio, Scherzinger and Spears, with Abdul's best performance being ninth place in 2011 (her only season), Scherzinger, Spears and Rowland placing second in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively (their only season), Rubio being third place in 2013 (her only season) and Lovato reaching fifth place in 2013 (the second of her two years on the panel).\n\n==Contestants==\n:{{Color box|gold;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Winner\n:{{Color box|silver;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Runner-up\n:{{Color box|#CC6633;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Third place\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

back to the live shows as he felt as though he had made a mistake in eliminating her. The first live show had a top 17 instead of a top 16. Cowell was the only judge that had to eliminate two acts instead of one. Resulting in there being a joint 13th for contestants Simone Battle, The Brewer Boys, Dexter Haygood, Phillip Lomax and Tiah Tolliver.\n* Fifth Harmony were previously known as \"LYLAS\" during the judges' houses stage and \"1432\" on the first live show.

As of December 2013, there have been three completed seasons. The final round of the competition features a number of solo singers or vocal groups: seventeen in season 1 and sixteen for season 2 and 3. A total of 49 acts have reached the finals of their season.\n\nDuring the first season the finalists were split into four groups: \"boys\", \"girls\", \"over 25s\" and \"groups\". Each set of contestants was mentored by one of the show's judges, [[Simon Cowell]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[L.A. Reid]]. In season 2, the \"boys\" and \"girls\" categories were scrapped and the \"teens\" and \"young adults\" categories were introduced. And the \"over 25s\" were still the same as season 1. Also in season 2, Abdul and Scherzinger left the show, leaving Cowell and Reid as the only two judges to return from the previous year. Cowell and Reid were joined on the panel by [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Britney Spears]]. In season 3, Reid and Spears left the show, Cowell and Lovato returned as judges from the previous year. [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Paulina Rubio]] joined the panel as replacements of Reid and Spears. The \"boys\" and \"girls\" categories were reintroduced in season 3, replacing the \"teens\" and \"young adults\" categories from the previous year.\n\nAs of season 3, only three categories have won the show on at least one occasion, while two of the show's eight judges have had the winning act in their category at least once, with Cowell winning twice, and Reid winning on one occasion. The judges not to win were Abdul, Lovato, Rowland, Rubio, Scherzinger and Spears, with Abdul's best performance being ninth place in 2011 (her only season), Scherzinger, Spears and Rowland placing second in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively (their only season), Rubio being third place in 2013 (her only season) and Lovato reaching fifth place in 2013 (the second of her two years on the panel).\n\n==Contestants==\n:{{Color box|gold;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Winner\n:{{Color box|silver;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Runner-up\n:{{Color box|#CC6633;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Third place\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was based on the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuz7k-l1.html|title=Soyuz 7K-L1|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> Several modifications reduced vehicle mass and increased circumlunar capability. The most notable modifications were the replacement of the orbital module with a support cone and a high-gain parabolic antenna, the removal of a reserve parachute, and the addition of the gyro platform and star navigation sensors for the far space navigation. The spacecraft was capable of carrying two [[cosmonauts]]. At the start of flight testing, there were serious reliability problems with the new [[Proton rocket]], the 7K-L1, and the Soyuz 7K-OK that the L1 was based on.\n\n==History==\nChief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had originally envisioned a crewed lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit. The development of [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s large UR-500 booster theoretically made it possible to do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing for lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft but concealed his true intentions by billing it as an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a crewed lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a [[UR-500]] topped with the [[Blok D]] stage under development by the [[OKB-1]] Bureau.\n\nKorolev originally intended to piece together the lunar Soyuz in Earth orbit because he did not believe the [[UR-500]] was powerful enough to launch the full vehicle or that it wouldn't be safe for the crew. However, when he died in January 1966, his successor as head of OKB-1, [[Vasily Mishin]], argued that it was definitely possible to strip down the Soyuz enough to launch it with the [[Proton (rocket family)|UR-500]].\n\nWith the first four uncrewed test starts (see below) being partially successful or unsuccessful, including two under the common open name \"[[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]]\" as for any Soviet test spacecraft, the mission of 2\u20137 March 1968 and subsequent ones were the flights of the L1 spacecraft under the open designation \"[[Zond program|Zond]]\" that were given by Soviets for test missions to far space.\n\nAfter the successful United States [[Apollo 8]] crewed flight around the Moon, the Soviet crewed Moon-flyby missions lost political motivation. The first crewed flight of the L1/Zond spacecraft with [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valery Bykovsky]] planned for the end of 1970 was cancelled. In addition, the Proton booster was far from being [[Human-rating_certification|human-rated]] and its poor launch record made it undesirable for crewed flights.\n\nAll L1/Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed flights from 1967\u20131970, from ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), and four of these [[Zond failed missions|five Zond flights]] suffered malfunctions. Test flights conducted around the Moon showed problems using their star sensors for navigation. These problems caused ballistic reentry due to failed guidance. One direct descent re-entry was performed on a steep ballistic trajectory with a deceleration of up to 20 Gs and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Three others performed a maneuver known as \"[[skip reentry]]\" to shed velocity. One of those also performed an unsafe (for humans) descent of up to 20 Gs of deceleration, the other suffered main parachute failure, and only one flight - [[Zond 7]] - would have been safe for cosmonauts.\n\nInstrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on [[micrometeor]] flux, solar and [[cosmic ray]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, radio emissions, and [[solar wind]]. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. [[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return them relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterward.<ref name=\"NK\">http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/252/43.shtml (in Russian)</ref>\n\nTwo modifications of main Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" version was created: the powered (up to 7000 kg mass) [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] \"Zond-M\" that were failed attempted to launch for Moon flyby on [[N1 rocket]] two times due to [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ship-module of L3 lunar expedition complex was not ready; the [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] \"Zond-LOK\" as dummy mockup of Soyuz 7K-LOK and were successfully launched on [[Low Earth Orbit]] on [[Proton rocket]] as [[Kosmos 382]] and failed launched for Moon orbiting on third [[N1 rocket]].\n\nNo official name for crewed Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" was adopted. According to [[Vasily Mishin|Mishin]]'s and [[Nikolai Kamanin|Kamanin]]'s memoirs, the names \"Rodina\" (''motherland''), \"Ural\" (''[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains''), \"Akademik Korolyov\" (''academician [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]]''). Also, \"Zarya\" (''dawn'') and \"Znamya\" (''banner'') were proposed for both lunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flyby and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ships. The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the L1 was called \"Saturn\" and featured some differences from the standard 7K-OK \"Sirius-7K\" IDS.\n\nAlong with the remaining 7K-L1S, the Soviet Moon-flyby program was closed in 1970 without the achievement of its crewed primary goal. The intended crewed use of L1/Zond spacecraft was documented in official Soviet sources for the first time but from 1968 until 1989 this and the Moon-landing [[N1-L3]] programs were classified and the Soviet government denied the existence of both. Near 1968 a rare open Soviet source ([[Big Soviet Encyclopedia]]'s Yearbook, Kosmonavtika small encyclopedia) sporadically referred to Zond's as tests of ''space ships'' for lunar missions in contrast to the ''space apparate'' term used by the Soviets for spacecraft not capable of carrying a crew.\n\n==Planned schedule==\n[[File:Proton-L1 (Zond) drawing.png|thumb|Proton 7K-L1 launch vehicle configuration]]\n\nAs of 1967, the Soyuz 7K-L1 launch schedule was:\n\nMission\n* 2P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 3P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 4L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - May 1967 (actually launched on 27 September 1967, booster failure)\n* 5L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - June 1967 (actually launched on 22 November 1967, booster failure)\n* 6L           - Crewed lunar flyby   - June or July 1767\n* 7L and 8L    - Crewed lunar flybys  - August 1967 (7L actually launched on 23 April 1968, as [[Zond 1968A]], booster failure; 8L actually launched on 21 July 1968, booster explosion)\n* 9L and 10L   - Crewed lunar flybys  - September 1967 (10L planned to launch as [[Zond 9]], cancelled)\n* 11L and 12L  - Crewed lunar flybys  - October 1967\n* 13L          - Reserve spacecraft (actually launched on 20 January 1969, as [[Zond 1969A]], booster failure)\n\nIn July 1968, it was proposed that L1 spacecraft would be launched every month, and the first crewed mission would be in December 1968 or January 1969 after 3 or 4 successful uncrewed flights. In December 1968, dates for three crewed L1 missions were set to March, May, and July 1969. Finally, in September 1969 one crewed L1 mission was formally set for April 1970.\n\n==Built spacecraft==\nFifteen Soyuz 7K-L1 were built:\n\n* s/n 1 - prototype not equipped with heat shield, intended to perfect orbital operation of the spacecraft without recovery of the capsule.

It was based on the [[Soyuz 7K-OK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuz7k-l1.html|title=Soyuz 7K-L1|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> Several modifications reduced vehicle mass and increased circumlunar capability. The most notable modifications were the replacement of the orbital module with a support cone and a high-gain parabolic antenna, the removal of a reserve parachute, and the addition of the gyro platform and star navigation sensors for the far space navigation. The spacecraft was capable of carrying two [[cosmonauts]]. At the start of flight testing, there were serious reliability problems with the new [[Proton rocket]], the 7K-L1, and the Soyuz 7K-OK that the L1 was based on.\n\n==History==\nChief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had originally envisioned a crewed lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit. The development of [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s large UR-500 booster theoretically made it possible to do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing for lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft but concealed his true intentions by billing it as an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a crewed lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a [[UR-500]] topped with the [[Blok D]] stage under development by the [[OKB-1]] Bureau.\n\nKorolev originally intended to piece together the lunar Soyuz in Earth orbit because he did not believe the [[UR-500]] was powerful enough to launch the full vehicle or that it wouldn't be safe for the crew. However, when he died in January 1966, his successor as head of OKB-1, [[Vasily Mishin]], argued that it was definitely possible to strip down the Soyuz enough to launch it with the [[Proton (rocket family)|UR-500]].\n\nWith the first four uncrewed test starts (see below) being partially successful or unsuccessful, including two under the common open name \"[[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]]\" as for any Soviet test spacecraft, the mission of 2\u20137 March 1968 and subsequent ones were the flights of the L1 spacecraft under the open designation \"[[Zond program|Zond]]\" that were given by Soviets for test missions to far space.\n\nAfter the successful United States [[Apollo 8]] crewed flight around the Moon, the Soviet crewed Moon-flyby missions lost political motivation. The first crewed flight of the L1/Zond spacecraft with [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valery Bykovsky]] planned for the end of 1970 was cancelled. In addition, the Proton booster was far from being [[Human-rating_certification|human-rated]] and its poor launch record made it undesirable for crewed flights.\n\nAll L1/Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed flights from 1967\u20131970, from ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), and four of these [[Zond failed missions|five Zond flights]] suffered malfunctions. Test flights conducted around the Moon showed problems using their star sensors for navigation. These problems caused ballistic reentry due to failed guidance. One direct descent re-entry was performed on a steep ballistic trajectory with a deceleration of up to 20 Gs and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Three others performed a maneuver known as \"[[skip reentry]]\" to shed velocity. One of those also performed an unsafe (for humans) descent of up to 20 Gs of deceleration, the other suffered main parachute failure, and only one flight - [[Zond 7]] - would have been safe for cosmonauts.\n\nInstrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on [[micrometeor]] flux, solar and [[cosmic ray]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, radio emissions, and [[solar wind]]. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. [[Zond 5]] was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return them relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterward.<ref name=\"NK\">http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/252/43.shtml (in Russian)</ref>\n\nTwo modifications of main Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" version was created: the powered (up to 7000 kg mass) [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] \"Zond-M\" that were failed attempted to launch for Moon flyby on [[N1 rocket]] two times due to [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ship-module of L3 lunar expedition complex was not ready; the [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] \"Zond-LOK\" as dummy mockup of Soyuz 7K-LOK and were successfully launched on [[Low Earth Orbit]] on [[Proton rocket]] as [[Kosmos 382]] and failed launched for Moon orbiting on third [[N1 rocket]].\n\nNo official name for crewed Soyuz 7K-L1 \"Zond\" was adopted. According to [[Vasily Mishin|Mishin]]'s and [[Nikolai Kamanin|Kamanin]]'s memoirs, the names \"Rodina\" (''motherland''), \"Ural\" (''[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains''), \"Akademik Korolyov\" (''academician [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]]''). Also, \"Zarya\" (''dawn'') and \"Znamya\" (''banner'') were proposed for both lunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flyby and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] orbital ships. The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the L1 was called \"Saturn\" and featured some differences from the standard 7K-OK \"Sirius-7K\" IDS.\n\nAlong with the remaining 7K-L1S, the Soviet Moon-flyby program was closed in 1970 without the achievement of its crewed primary goal. The intended crewed use of L1/Zond spacecraft was documented in official Soviet sources for the first time but from 1968 until 1989 this and the Moon-landing [[N1-L3]] programs were classified and the Soviet government denied the existence of both. Near 1968 a rare open Soviet source ([[Big Soviet Encyclopedia]]'s Yearbook, Kosmonavtika small encyclopedia) sporadically referred to Zond's as tests of ''space ships'' for lunar missions in contrast to the ''space apparate'' term used by the Soviets for spacecraft not capable of carrying a crew.\n\n==Planned schedule==\n[[File:Proton-L1 (Zond) drawing.png|thumb|Proton 7K-L1 launch vehicle configuration]]\n\nAs of 1967, the Soyuz 7K-L1 launch schedule was:\n\nMission\n* 2P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 3P           - Develop Blok D stage - March 1967\n* 4L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - May 1967 (actually launched on 27 September 1967, booster failure)\n* 5L           - Uncrewed lunar flyby - June 1967 (actually launched on 22 November 1967, booster failure)\n* 6L           - Crewed lunar flyby   - June or July 1767\n* 7L and 8L    - Crewed lunar flybys  - August 1967 (7L actually launched on 23 April 1968, as [[Zond 1968A]], booster failure; 8L actually launched on 21 July 1968, booster explosion)\n* 9L and 10L   - Crewed lunar flybys  - September 1967 (10L planned to launch as [[Zond 9]], cancelled)\n* 11L and 12L  - Crewed lunar flybys  - October 1967\n* 13L          - Reserve spacecraft (actually launched on 20 January 1969, as [[Zond 1969A]], booster failure)\n\nIn July 1968, it was proposed that L1 spacecraft would be launched every month, and the first crewed mission would be in December 1968 or January 1969 after 3 or 4 successful uncrewed flights. In December 1968, dates for three crewed L1 missions were set to March, May, and July 1969. Finally, in September 1969 one crewed L1 mission was formally set for April 1970.\n\n==Built spacecraft==\nFifteen Soyuz 7K-L1 were built:\n\n* s/n 1 - prototype not equipped with heat shield, intended to perfect orbital operation of the spacecraft without recovery of the capsule.
