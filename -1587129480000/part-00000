Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any outside government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain.<ref>Lepore (1998), ''The Name of War'' (1999) pp 5-7</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Plymouth Colony]] was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Indians, particularly [[Squanto]] and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors. A jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder, and they were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 [[Julian calendar|(O.S.)]], at Plymouth.\n\n==Southern theater, 1675==\n\n=== Raid on Swansea ===\nA band of [[Pokanoket]]s attacked several isolated homesteads in the small Plymouth colony settlement of [[Swansea, Massachusetts|Swansea]] on June 20, 1675.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5m90c088;view=1up;seq=78| title=The History of King Philip's War| author=Church, Benjamin (1639-1718)| publisher=HathiTrust| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign. The nearby towns in Rhode Island provided care for the wounded until they could return to their homes.<ref>Leach (1954), ''Flintlock and Tomahawk'', pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n=== Mohawk intervention ===\nIn December 1675, Metacomet established a winter camp in [[Schaghticoke (village), New York|Schaghticoke]], New York.<ref name=\"eric17\">{{cite book|last1=Tougias|first1=Michael|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|date=2017|publisher=Countryman Press|isbn=1581574908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I422DAAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref> His reason for moving into New York has been attributed to a desire to enlist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] aid in the conflict.<ref name=\"drake\">{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=James|title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676|date=1999|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1558492240|page=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/122 122]|url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration}}</ref> Though New York was a non-belligerent, Governor [[Edmund Andros]] was nonetheless concerned at the arrival of the Wampanoag sachem.<ref name=\"eric17\"/> Either with Andros' sanction, or of their own accord, the Mohawk - traditional rivals of the Algonquian people - launched a surprise assault against a 500-warrior band under Metacomet's command the following February.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref name=\"drake\"/> The \"ruthless\" ''[[coup de main]]'' resulted in the death of between 70 and as many as 460 of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"barr\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/> His forces crippled, Metacomet withdrew to New England, pursued \"relentlessly\" by Mohawk forces who attacked Algonquian settlements and ambushed their supply parties.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Calloway|first1=Colin|title=After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=1611680611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXrgK29zl2QC&dq}}</ref><ref name=\"barr\">{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Daniel|title=Unconquered: The Iroquois League at War in Colonial America|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275984664|page=[https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73 73]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several months, fear of Mohawk attack led some Wampanoag to surrender to the colonists, and one historian described the decision of the Mohawk to engage Metacomet's forces as \"the blow that lost the war for Philip\".<ref name=\"drake\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/>\n\n===Indian campaign===\nIndians attacked and destroyed more settlements throughout the winter of 1675\u201376 in their effort to annihilate the colonists.

They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people.

The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period. His head was displayed in Plymouth for a generation.<ref>Schultz, Eric and Michael Tougias. ''King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict\". The Countryman Press. 1999. p. 290</ref>\n\nCaptain Church and his soldiers captured Pocasset war chief Anawan on August 28, 1676 at [[Anawan Rock]] in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]]. He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676.

Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet.

Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675 near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign.

They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people.

The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict.

Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].

The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]].

The pedals are attached to the floating link referred to as the coupler.  The first published work on the subject of elliptical path generation is given in 1988 by researchers at Purdue University in which the path of a point on the floating link is shown to approximately follow an elliptical shape.<ref>Farhang, K., Midha, A., and Hall, A.

Its patented mechanism weds a rear flywheel with a forward foot pedal, creating a smooth, elliptical movement. This is key to foot comfort and reduces numbing of the foot experienced on other stationary cardio equipment.\n\nThis approach is classified as \"low impact\" as it keeps a person's heels in contact with the pedals, reducing muscle and tendon stress.\n\n== Types ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThere are three types of elliptical trainers, categorized by the location of the [[motor]] or \"drive.\" The oldest elliptical design is the \"rear drive\" type, the second generation elliptical design is the \"front-drive\" type, and the most recent elliptical design is the \"center-drive\" type.\n\nOn some models, the [[inclined plane|incline]] of sloping roller-ramps beneath the pedal-links can be adjusted to produce varying pedal-motion paths. An adjustable ramp, whether automatic or manual, alters the angle of the elliptical path which can vary hip actuation as well as vary the stride length. This can allow a user to alter his or her workout to target various lower body [[muscles]]. In addition to the lower body, elliptical workouts are known to target the whole body. While mostly targeting the [[Gluteus maximus muscle|glutes]], [[hamstring]]s and [[Calf (leg)|calves]], ellipticals can also target the core, [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]], [[biceps]] and [[shoulder]]s depending on the workout. Some elliptical trainers even enable exercisers to use preset programs to automatically vary [[inclined plane|incline]], [[Friction|resistance]], and stride length over the course of a workout. In addition, some elliptical trainers can be driven in either a forward or a reverse direction.\n\nElliptical trainers are primarily driven by the user's legs, and most are combination designs having handle-levers attached to each pedal-link to enable some burden on the arms and to provide a secondary source of driving power. The user grips the handles below shoulder height and pushes and pulls the arms while shuffling the feet back and forth within elliptically-shaped paths. Thus the oscillating handle-motions are dependent on \u2013 and coordinated with \u2013 the constrained pedal-motions. Some poorly designed machines are too dependent on the user's leg power, producing excessive handle speeds due to mechanical ratios that do not provide enough [[mechanical advantage]] to the handle-levers. Consequently, such machines might feel to the user as if his arms are simply \"going along for the ride\" rather than performing a meaningful portion of the work. Better models of elliptical trainers offer a more balanced \u2013 or even harmonious \u2013 combination of arm and leg exercise in useful, proper ratios.\n\nSome manufacturers produce durable commercial models made to withstand frequent use in a [[health club|fitness club]] environment, at prices that can be in excess of $4,000. Inexpensive models are available for home use at prices starting around $200. More expensive elliptical trainers \u2013 especially commercial machines \u2013 are more likely to offer more features such as extensive programs and better adjustment options.\n\n== Benefits ==\nAn elliptical cross trainer is comparable to a [[treadmill]] in its exertion of leg muscles and the heart.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Ellipticals produce an intermediate range of leg motion between that of [[stationary bike]]s and treadmills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crosstrainerguides.co.uk/|website=EllipticalHub|title= Is the Elliptical the Best for Cardio-Respiratory Fitness?|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a study of 9 males and 9 females were chosen to exercise at the same [[Rating of perceived exertion|RPE]] on the treadmill or elliptical and found that energy expenditure and oxygen consumption were the same in the two forms of exercise equipment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Gregory A.|last2=Cook|first2=Chad M.|last3=Krueger|first3=Ryan D.|last4=Heelan|first4=Kate A.|date=June 2010|title=Comparison of energy expenditure on a treadmill vs. an elliptical device at a self-selected exercise intensity|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1643\u20131649|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181cb2854|issn=1533-4287|pmid=20453685}}</ref>  Thomas Altena, a professor of nutritional and exercise physiology at the [[University of Missouri]], measured oxygen retention, lactic acid build-up, heart rate, and perceived rate of exertion to compare treadmills and elliptical trainers,<ref name=Altena>{{cite news|work=American Fitness|title=Treadmills vs. Elliptical Trainers|date= July\u2013August 2002|volume= 20 |issue =4|page=9}}</ref> finding that the \"physiological responses associated with elliptical exercise were nearly identical to treadmill exercise\".<ref name=Altena /> However, it is important that the resistance set on the elliptical machine is at a relatively high setting, depending on the user.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gymsource.com/blog/elliptical-trainers-keep-up-the-resistance/|publisher=[[Gym Source]]|title=Elliptical Trainers: Keep Up the Resistance|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince users do not take their feet off the pedals, there is no footfall noise in contrast with other fitness trainers such as treadmills.\n\nA 2002 study by the [[University of Idaho]]<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1097/00005768-200205001-00198\n| volume = 34\n| issue = 5\n| pages = S35\n| last = Browder\n| first = K.

The study also showed that as the stride is lengthened, more calories are burned without any higher rate of perceived exertion by the user.  This study is in agreement with the claims made about the adjustable stride length feature on some newer ellipticals.\n\n== Common usage ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThough procedures vary between various models, most are similar in that the user adopts a comfortable standing position with his or her spine in a neutral position (with a straight back). The user aligns their knees, hips and ankles; and ensures that their weight is distributed between the heels and the balls of the feet. The user grips the handrails in a smooth controlled motion, striding either in a forward or reverse motion, working through a full natural range of movement smoothly and continuously.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cross-training]]\n* [[ElliptiGO]]\n* [[StreetStrider]]\n* [[Treadle bicycle]]\n* [[Weight training]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Exercise equipment]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2008}}\n[[File:Elliptical machine.jpg|thumb|Commercial elliptical trainer (rear drive version)]]\n[[File:Gym Cardio Area Overlooking Greenery.JPG|thumb|Row of elliptical trainers at a gym (right)]]\n[[File:ElliptiGO Miller Hiwy jeh.jpg|thumb|[[ElliptiGO]] trainers are elliptical but not stationary.]]\n\nAn '''elliptical trainer''' or '''cross-trainer''' (also  called an X-trainer) is a stationary [[exercise machine]] used to stair climb, [[walk]], or [[Running|run]] without causing excessive pressure to the joints, hence decreasing the risk of impact injuries.

S., Jr., l988b, \"Synthesis of Harmonic Motion Generating Linkages-Part II: Path and Motion Generation,\" ASME Journal of Mechanisms, Transmissions, and Automation in Design, Vol. 110, No. 1, pp. 22-27.</ref>\nIn 1995, Precor introduced the Elliptical Fitness Crosstrainer (EFX),<ref>{{cite web|date=May 14, 2013|url=http://www.ihrsa.org/blog/2013/5/14/paul-byrne-precor-president-to-retire-in-september.html|title=Paul Byrne, Precor President to Retire in September|website= IHRSA Blog}}</ref> the first piece of exercise equipment to allow the foot to roll from heel to toe just like in running. Its patented mechanism weds a rear flywheel with a forward foot pedal, creating a smooth, elliptical movement. This is key to foot comfort and reduces numbing of the foot experienced on other stationary cardio equipment.\n\nThis approach is classified as \"low impact\" as it keeps a person's heels in contact with the pedals, reducing muscle and tendon stress.\n\n== Types ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThere are three types of elliptical trainers, categorized by the location of the [[motor]] or \"drive.\" The oldest elliptical design is the \"rear drive\" type, the second generation elliptical design is the \"front-drive\" type, and the most recent elliptical design is the \"center-drive\" type.\n\nOn some models, the [[inclined plane|incline]] of sloping roller-ramps beneath the pedal-links can be adjusted to produce varying pedal-motion paths. An adjustable ramp, whether automatic or manual, alters the angle of the elliptical path which can vary hip actuation as well as vary the stride length. This can allow a user to alter his or her workout to target various lower body [[muscles]]. In addition to the lower body, elliptical workouts are known to target the whole body. While mostly targeting the [[Gluteus maximus muscle|glutes]], [[hamstring]]s and [[Calf (leg)|calves]], ellipticals can also target the core, [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]], [[biceps]] and [[shoulder]]s depending on the workout. Some elliptical trainers even enable exercisers to use preset programs to automatically vary [[inclined plane|incline]], [[Friction|resistance]], and stride length over the course of a workout. In addition, some elliptical trainers can be driven in either a forward or a reverse direction.\n\nElliptical trainers are primarily driven by the user's legs, and most are combination designs having handle-levers attached to each pedal-link to enable some burden on the arms and to provide a secondary source of driving power. The user grips the handles below shoulder height and pushes and pulls the arms while shuffling the feet back and forth within elliptically-shaped paths. Thus the oscillating handle-motions are dependent on \u2013 and coordinated with \u2013 the constrained pedal-motions. Some poorly designed machines are too dependent on the user's leg power, producing excessive handle speeds due to mechanical ratios that do not provide enough [[mechanical advantage]] to the handle-levers. Consequently, such machines might feel to the user as if his arms are simply \"going along for the ride\" rather than performing a meaningful portion of the work. Better models of elliptical trainers offer a more balanced \u2013 or even harmonious \u2013 combination of arm and leg exercise in useful, proper ratios.\n\nSome manufacturers produce durable commercial models made to withstand frequent use in a [[health club|fitness club]] environment, at prices that can be in excess of $4,000. Inexpensive models are available for home use at prices starting around $200. More expensive elliptical trainers \u2013 especially commercial machines \u2013 are more likely to offer more features such as extensive programs and better adjustment options.\n\n== Benefits ==\nAn elliptical cross trainer is comparable to a [[treadmill]] in its exertion of leg muscles and the heart.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Ellipticals produce an intermediate range of leg motion between that of [[stationary bike]]s and treadmills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellipticalhub.com/elliptical-cardio-respiratory-fitness/|website=EllipticalHub|title= Is the Elliptical the Best for Cardio Respiratory Fitness?|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a study of 9 males and 9 females were chosen to exercise at the same [[Rating of perceived exertion|RPE]] on the treadmill or elliptical and found that energy expenditure and oxygen consumption were the same in the two forms of exercise equipment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Gregory A.|last2=Cook|first2=Chad M.|last3=Krueger|first3=Ryan D.|last4=Heelan|first4=Kate A.|date=June 2010|title=Comparison of energy expenditure on a treadmill vs. an elliptical device at a self-selected exercise intensity|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1643\u20131649|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181cb2854|issn=1533-4287|pmid=20453685}}</ref>  Thomas Altena, a professor of nutritional and exercise physiology at the [[University of Missouri]], measured oxygen retention, lactic acid build-up, heart rate, and perceived rate of exertion to compare treadmills and elliptical trainers,<ref name=Altena>{{cite news|work=American Fitness|title=Treadmills vs. Elliptical Trainers|date= July\u2013August 2002|volume= 20 |issue =4|page=9}}</ref> finding that the \"physiological responses associated with elliptical exercise were nearly identical to treadmill exercise\".<ref name=Altena /> However, it is important that the resistance set on the elliptical machine is at a relatively high setting, depending on the user.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gymsource.com/blog/elliptical-trainers-keep-up-the-resistance/|publisher=[[Gym Source]]|title=Elliptical Trainers: Keep Up the Resistance|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince users do not take their feet off the pedals, there is no footfall noise in contrast with other fitness trainers such as treadmills.\n\nA 2002 study by the [[University of Idaho]]<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1097/00005768-200205001-00198\n| volume = 34\n| issue = 5\n| pages = S35\n| last = Browder\n| first = K. D\n|author2=D. G Dolny\n| title = Lower extremity muscle activation during elliptical trainer exercise\n| journal = Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\n| year = 2002\n}}</ref> shows that varying the stride length on the elliptical trainer can recruit a larger variety of muscle groups.  The study also showed that as the stride is lengthened, more calories are burned without any higher rate of perceived exertion by the user.  This study is in agreement with the claims made about the adjustable stride length feature on some newer ellipticals.\n\n== Common usage ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThough procedures vary between various models, most are similar in that the user adopts a comfortable standing position with his or her spine in a neutral position (with a straight back). The user aligns their knees, hips and ankles; and ensures that their weight is distributed between the heels and the balls of the feet. The user grips the handrails in a smooth controlled motion, striding either in a forward or reverse motion, working through a full natural range of movement smoothly and continuously.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cross-training]]\n* [[ElliptiGO]]\n* [[StreetStrider]]\n* [[Treadle bicycle]]\n* [[Weight training]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Exercise equipment]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:dc72:7f00:5cab:ba7c:9f4d:8b4d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBenefits)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_trainer"}

The procedure consists of placing a cap (usually made of [[cobalt-chrome]] metal), which is hollow and shaped like a mushroom, over the head of the [[femur]] while a matching metal cup (similar to what is used with a THR) is placed in the [[acetabulum]] ([[pelvis socket]]), replacing the articulating surfaces of the patient's hip joint and removing very little bone compared to a THR.  When the patient moves the hip, the movement of the joint induces [[synovial fluid]] to flow between the hard metal bearing surfaces lubricating them when the components are placed in the correct position. The surgeon's level of experience with hip resurfacing is most important; therefore, the selection of the right surgeon is  crucial for a successful outcome. Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and patient satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Koutras C, Antoniou SA, Talias MA, Heep H |title=Impact of Total Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty on Health-Related Quality of Life Measures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. |journal=J Arthroplasty. |date=19 May 2015 |pmid=26067708 |doi=10.1016/j.arth.2015.05.014 |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1938\u201352}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n[[Image:Bhrgraphic.jpg|155px|right|thumb|The BHR]]\nThe potential advantages of hip resurfacing compared to THR include less bone removal (bone preservation), a reduced chance of hip dislocation due to a relatively larger femoral head size (given that the patient has an anatomically correct femoral head size), and easier revision surgery for any subsequent revision to a THR device because a surgeon will have more original bone stock available.<ref name=Mont06/> Hip resurfacing has the potential of being a solution for life, allows a normal ROM (range of movement) and minimizes the amount of \"stress shielding\", compared with THR. Since the femoral neck is retained and the femoral cavity with its marrow not opened up two other advantages exist, namely no risk of blood clots by fatty marrow that can enter the blood stream with the THR procedure and no risk of introducing bacteria in the opened femoral canal resulting in a deep infection as can happen with the THR procedure. The potential disadvantages of hip resurfacing are femoral neck fractures (rate of 0\u20134%), aseptic loosening, and metal wear.<ref name=Mont06/> Due to the retention of the patient's complete femoral neck other advantages exist: Surgeon induced discrepancies in leg length (as could happen with THR) are now minimized.

These early designs used metal-on-polyethylene bearings, and had poor results compared to THR at the time.

A THR requires that the upper portion of the femur bone be cut off to accept the stem portion of a THR device.  The femur cap of the hip resurfacing devices does not require the femur bone be cut off; instead the top of the femoral head is shaped to closely fit the underside of the cap. Both hip resurfacing and hip replacement require that a cup is placed in the acetabulum of the hip socket. The main advantage of the hip resurfacing surgery is that when a revision is required, there is still an intact femur bone left for a THR stem. When a THR stem requires a revision, the metal stem in the femur has to be removed and often more bone is lost in the process of removal and replacement with a larger diameter stem.  Having a hip resurfacing at a younger age means that a revision will likely be easier to perform when required.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120905183420/http://www.orthosupersite.com/view.asp?rID=21433 Resurfaced hips converted to THA show similar clinical results to primary total hips]<!-- Referencing conf. paper, not secondary review --></ref>\n\nRecent studies have shown that the outcome of a hip resurfacing is dependent on surgeon experience<ref>[https://archive.today/20120912170929/http://www.orthosupersite.com/view.asp?rID=37423 Outcome of Hip Resurfacing May be dependent on experience]<!-- Referencing conf. paper, not secondary review --></ref> and that proper positioning of hip resurfacing components is crucial.<ref>[http://jbjsbrproc.highwire.org/cgi/content/abstract/88-B/SUPP_III/432 Metal-on-Metal Hip Resurfacing: The Effect of Component Position ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707054943/http://jbjsbrproc.highwire.org/cgi/content/abstract/88-B/SUPP_III/432 |date=2011-07-07 }} <!-- Referencing conf. paper?, not secondary review --></ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=De Haan R, Campbell PA, Su EP, De Smet KA |title=Revision of metal-on-metal resurfacing arthroplasty of the hip: the influence of malpositioning of the components |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=90 |issue=9 |pages=1158\u201363 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18757954 |doi=10.1302/0301-620X.90B9.19891 |url=http://bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18757954}}</ref> Therefore, in addition to ensuring that a proven device is used, patients should take care in selecting a surgeon with experience and a good track record.\n\nAlthough formal labeling restrictions exist in some countries, including the United States, hip resurfacing may allow younger, active people to return to many activities they enjoyed prior to their hip problems,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://web.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/content/abstract/86-B/2/177/ |title=Results of Hip Resurfacing in patients under 55 years with osteoarthritis |access-date=2010-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707105855/http://web.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/content/abstract/86-B/2/177 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Naal FD, Maffiuletti NA, Munzinger U, Hersche O |title=Sports after hip resurfacing arthroplasty |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=705\u201311 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17218652 |doi=10.1177/0363546506296606 }}</ref> which is an advantage over a traditional hip arthroplasty.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barrack RL |title=Metal-metal hip resurfacing offers advantages over traditional arthroplasty in selected patients |journal=Orthopedics |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=725\u20136 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17899914 |doi=10.3928/01477447-20070901-16 }}</ref> The large size cap and cup of the hip resurfacing devices are the same size as a person's original ball and socket and thus are less prone to dislocation.\n\nAn often forgotten but very important advantage of hip resurfacing and thereby the retention of the femoral neck is the fact that hip resurfacing has the least measurable amount of \"stress shielding\" when compared to any type of THR.

The procedure consists of placing a cap (usually made of [[cobalt-chrome]] metal), which is hollow and shaped like a mushroom, over the head of the [[femur]] while a matching metal cup (similar to what is used with a THR) is placed in the [[acetabulum]] ([[pelvis socket]]), replacing the articulating surfaces of the patient's hip joint and removing very little bone compared to a THR.  When the patient moves the hip, the movement of the joint induces [[synovial fluid]] to flow between the hard metal bearing surfaces lubricating them when the components are placed in the correct position. The surgeon's level of experience with hip resurfacing is most important; therefore, the selection of the right surgeon is  crucial for a successful outcome. Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and patient satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Koutras C, Antoniou SA, Talias MA, Heep H |title=Impact of Total Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty on Health-Related Quality of Life Measures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. |journal=J Arthroplasty. |date=19 May 2015 |pmid=26067708 |doi=10.1016/j.arth.2015.05.014 |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1938\u201352}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n[[Image:Bhrgraphic.jpg|155px|right|thumb|The BHR]]\nThe potential advantages of hip resurfacing compared to THR include less bone removal (bone preservation), a reduced chance of hip dislocation due to a relatively larger femoral head size (given that the patient has an anatomically correct femoral head size), and easier revision surgery for any subsequent revision to a THR device because a surgeon will have more original bone stock available.<ref name=Mont06/> Hip resurfacing has the potential of being a solution for life, allows a normal ROM (range of movement) and minimizes the amount of \"stress shielding\", compared with THR.

Having a hip resurfacing at a younger age means that a revision will likely be easier to perform when required.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120905183420/http://www.orthosupersite.com/view.asp?rID=21433 Resurfaced hips converted to THA show similar clinical results to primary total hips]<!-- Referencing conf. paper, not secondary review --></ref>\n\nRecent studies have shown that the outcome of a hip resurfacing is dependent on surgeon experience<ref>[https://archive.today/20120912170929/http://www.orthosupersite.com/view.asp?rID=37423 Outcome of Hip Resurfacing May be dependent on experience]<!-- Referencing conf. paper, not secondary review --></ref> and that proper positioning of hip resurfacing components is crucial.<ref>[http://jbjsbrproc.highwire.org/cgi/content/abstract/88-B/SUPP_III/432 Metal-on-Metal Hip Resurfacing: The Effect of Component Position ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707054943/http://jbjsbrproc.highwire.org/cgi/content/abstract/88-B/SUPP_III/432 |date=2011-07-07 }} <!-- Referencing conf. paper?, not secondary review --></ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=De Haan R, Campbell PA, Su EP, De Smet KA |title=Revision of metal-on-metal resurfacing arthroplasty of the hip: the influence of malpositioning of the components |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=90 |issue=9 |pages=1158\u201363 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18757954 |doi=10.1302/0301-620X.90B9.19891 |url=http://bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18757954}}</ref> Therefore, in addition to ensuring that a proven device is used, patients should take care in selecting a surgeon with experience and a good track record.\n\nAlthough formal labeling restrictions exist in some countries, including the United States, hip resurfacing may allow younger, active people to return to many activities they enjoyed prior to their hip problems,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://web.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/content/abstract/86-B/2/177/ |title=Results of Hip Resurfacing in patients under 55 years with osteoarthritis |access-date=2010-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707105855/http://web.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/content/abstract/86-B/2/177 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Naal FD, Maffiuletti NA, Munzinger U, Hersche O |title=Sports after hip resurfacing arthroplasty |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=705\u201311 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17218652 |doi=10.1177/0363546506296606 }}</ref> which is an advantage over a traditional hip arthroplasty.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barrack RL |title=Metal-metal hip resurfacing offers advantages over traditional arthroplasty in selected patients |journal=Orthopedics |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=725\u20136 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17899914 |doi=10.3928/01477447-20070901-16 }}</ref> The large size cap and cup of the hip resurfacing devices are the same size as a person's original ball and socket and thus are less prone to dislocation.\n\nAn often forgotten but very important advantage of hip resurfacing and thereby the retention of the femoral neck is the fact that hip resurfacing has the least measurable amount of \"stress shielding\" when compared to any type of THR.

It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Luxury yacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.
