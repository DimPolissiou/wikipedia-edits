[https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca The Discovery and Early Development of Insulin Digital Collection], Toronto]]\nBorn in [[Belleville, Ontario]], he enrolled at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] at the age of 15, and studied [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]]. He obtained a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the same university in 1916.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1915, at the age of 22, Collip accepted a lecturing position in [[Edmonton]] in the Department of Physiology at the [[University of Alberta]] Faculty of Medicine, shortly before completing his doctorate. He fulfilled the role for 7 years, eventually rising to the position of Professor and Head of the Department of Biochemistry in 1922. His research at the time was mainly focused on [[blood]] [[chemistry]] of [[vertebrates]] and [[invertebrates]].\n\nHe took a [[sabbatical]] leave beginning in April 1921, and travelled to Toronto on a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] Travelling Scholarship for a six-month position with Professor [[John James Rickard Macleod|J. J. R. MacLeod]] of the University of Toronto's Department of Physiology. There his research program (on the effect of pH on the concentration of sugar in the blood) would take him to marine biological stations in [[Marine Biological Laboratory|Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Saint Andrews, New Brunswick|St. Andrews]], [[New Brunswick]] before he returned to Toronto late in the year.\n\nMacLeod was overseeing the work of [[Frederick Banting]] and [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] in their search for a treatment for [[diabetes]] which they had begun in May 1921. In December, when Banting and Best were having difficulties in refining the pancreatic extract, MacLeod freed Collip from his other research to enable him to join the research team. Collip's task was to prepare insulin in a more pure, usable form than Banting and Best had been able to achieve to date.\n\n==Success of insulin==\nIn January 1922, after 14-year-old [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]] suffered a severe allergic reaction to an injection of insulin, Collip achieved the goal of preparing a pancreatic extract pure enough for him to recover and to use in clinical trials. Successful trials were soon completed and the future of insulin was assured. Banting, Best and Collip subsequently shared the patent for insulin, which they sold to the University of Toronto for one dollar.\n\nRegrettably, due to disagreements between Banting and MacLeod, there was ill-will generated within the team. The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] was awarded to Banting and MacLeod in 1923. Feeling that Best had been overlooked in the award, Banting shared his portion with Best. In response, MacLeod shared his portion with Collip. Nonetheless, Collip (and Best) have been largely forgotten as co-discoverers of insulin.\n\nFollowing this early success,  Collip returned to Edmonton to take up a position as Head of the new Department of Biochemistry, and to pursue his own studies on hormone research. In 1928 he was recruited to [[McGill University]] in Montreal by his former graduate advisor, [[Archibald Macallum]]. Collip served as Chair of McGill's Department of Biochemistry from 1928 to 1941. From 1947-1961, Collip was appointed Dean of Medicine at the [[University of Western Ontario]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdnmedhall.org/inductees/jamescollip|title=James Collip MD PhD &#124; Canadian Medical Hall of Fame|website=www.cdnmedhall.org}}</ref> He is regarded as a pioneer of [[Endocrine system|endocrine research]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Family Computer'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf|Famir\u012b Konpy\u016bta|lead=yes}} or {{Nihongo|'''Famicom'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3|Famikon}} was developed in 1982 and launched in 1983 in Japan. Following the North American [[video game crash of 1983]], the Famicom was adapted into the NES which was brazenly launched in North America in 1985. Transitioning the company from its [[arcade game]] history into this combined global [[8-bit]] [[home video game console]] platform, the Famicom and NES continued to aggressively compete with the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|next-generation 16-bit consoles]] including the 1988 [[Sega Genesis]]. The platform was succeeded by the Super Famicom in 1990 and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1991, but its support and production continued until 1995. Interest in the NES has been renewed by collectors and [[Console emulator|emulators]], including Nintendo's own [[Virtual Console]] platform.\n\n==Origins (1982\u20131984)==\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Console-Set-FL.png|thumb|Family Computer (Japan)]]\nThe North American video game market experienced a period of rapid growth and unprecedented popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Intellivision]] proved to be wildly popular, and many third-party developers arose in their wake to exploit the growing industry. Nintendo was one such development studio, and, by 1982 had found success with a number of [[arcade game]]s, such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', which was in turn ported to, and packaged with the [[ColecoVision]] console in North America.\n\nLed by [[Masayuki Uemura]], Nintendo's R&D team had been secretly working on a system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance that could not be surpassed by its competitors for at least a year.<ref name=\"Turner/Nutt 2\">{{Cite book |last=Turner |first=Benjamin |last2=Nutt |first2=Christian |date=July 15, 2003 |chapter=Building the Ultimate Game Machine |chapter-url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |title=Nintendo Famicom: 20 Years of Fun! |publisher=GameSpy |page=7 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805160509/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |archive-date=August 5, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Uemura initially thought of using a modern [[16-bit]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], but instead settled on the inexpensive [[MOS Technology 6502]], supplementing it with a custom [[graphics processing unit|graphics chip]] (the [[Picture Processing Unit]]).<ref name=\"liedholm1\" /> To keep costs down, suggestions of including a [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], [[modem]], and [[floppy disk]] drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-[[pin]] expansion [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] connection on the front of the console for future add-on functionality such as [[peripheral device]]s.\n\nThe keyboard, [[Famicom Modem]], and [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]] would later be released as add-on peripherals, all utilizing the Famicom expansion port. Other peripheral devices connecting via the expansion port would include the [[NES Zapper|Famicom Light Gun]], [[Power Pad|Family Trainer]], and various specialized controllers. Many such devices would be produced for the console, though many of them, including the [[Famicom 3D System]] and Famicom Disk System, were never released outside Japan.\n\nLaunching on July 15, 1983,<ref name=\"SEC Nintendo 2544\">{{cite journal | title=Gaming for 5 to 95 | id=82-2544 | date=March 31, 2003 | publisher=Nintendo Co Ltd. | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/03/9999999997-03-043511 | accessdate=December 28, 2014 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229023442/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/03/9999999997-03-043511 | archive-date=December 29, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> the Family Computer (commonly known by the [[wasei-eigo|Japanese-English]] term Famicom) is an 8-bit console using interchangeable [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]]s.<ref name=\"liedholm1\">{{cite web|last1=Liedholm |first1=Marcus |last2=Liedholm |first2=Mattias |title=History of the Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom |website=Nintendo Land |url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?nes/history.htm |accessdate=February 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525223925/http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?nes%2Fhistory.htm |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Famicom was released in Japan on July 15, 1983, for {{JPY|14800}}.

Though the issue was cleared up within a month, by then Atari's financial problems stemming from the [[North American video game crash of 1983]] left the company unable to follow through with the deal.<ref name=\"Turner/Nutt 11\">{{Cite book |last=Turner |first=Benjamin |last2=Nutt |first2=Christian |date=July 15, 2003 |chapter=Coming to America |chapter-url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index11.shtml |title=Nintendo Famicom: 20 Years of Fun! |publisher=GameSpy |page=11 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040701101711/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index11.shtml |archive-date=July 1, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== North America ===\n\n====Advanced Video System home computer (1985)====\n[[File:Nintendo Advanced Video System (retouched).jpg|thumb|Nintendo Advanced Video System accessories as showcased at the Nintendo World Store.<ref name=\"NES World\">{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Nielsen |title=The Nintendo Entertainment System |url=http://www.nesworld.com/nes.php |work=NES World |date=August 19, 2005 |accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> Clockwise from the left: data recorder, keyboard, joystick, Zapper light gun, controllers.]]\n\n{{Commons category|Nintendo Advanced Video System}}\n\nAfter the [[video game crash of 1983]], many American retailers considered video games a passing [[fad]], and greatly reduced or discontinued the inventory of such products.<ref name=\"Rise of Nintendo\" /> Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] said in 1986, \"Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third-party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games.\"<ref name=takiff19860620/> After the deal with Atari failed, Nintendo proceeded alone, reconceiving the Famicom console with a sophisticated design language as the \"Nintendo Advanced Video System\" (AVS).<ref name=\"In Their Words\"/> To keep the software market for its console from becoming similarly oversaturated, Nintendo added a [[10NES|lockout]] system to obstruct unlicensed software from running on the console, thus allowing Nintendo to enforce strict licensing standards. The software carries the [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]] to communicate the company's approval.\n\nNintendo's product designer Lance Barr, who would continue with the company for decades, retooled the Famicom console with a sleek and sophisticated design language. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic color scheme of grey, black, and red. The top and bottom portions are in different shades of grey, plus a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The shape is boxier: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight.<ref name=\"In Their Words\"/> To avoid the stigma of video game consoles, Nintendo issued prerelease marketing of the AVS as a full [[home computer]],<ref name=\"AVS Nintendo\" /> with an included keyboard, [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|cassette data recorder]], and a [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] software cartridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/11/retro-nintendos/ |title=Retro: Nintendo's 1985 Wireless-Equipped Gaming PC |accessdate=November 2, 2015 |last=Beschizza |first=Rob |date=November 2, 2007 |work=Gadget Lab |publisher=Wired}}</ref> The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the ''[[Family BASIC]]'' package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the [[Famicom Data Recorder]]. The AVS includes a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a 3-octave [[musical keyboard]], and the Zapper [[light gun]]. The AVS Zapper is hinged, allowing it to straighten out into a wand form, or bend into a gun form.

Disappointed with the cosmetically raw prototype part they received from Japan, which they nicknamed \"the lunchbox\", Nintendo of America designers Lance Barr and Don James added the two-tone gray, the black stripe, and the red lettering.<ref name=\"In Their Words\"/> To obscure the video game connotation, NES replaced the top-loading cartridge slot of the Famicom and AVS with a front-loading chamber for software cartridges that place the inserted cartridge out of view, reminiscent of a [[VCR]]. The Famicom's pair of hard-wired controllers, and the AVS's wireless controllers, were replaced with two custom 7-pin sockets for detachable wired controllers.<ref name=\"AVS Nintendo\">{{cite web|title=The Game System That Almost Wasn't|url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/nes/index.html|website=Nintendo Power Source|publisher=Nintendo of America|accessdate=2 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971012013943/http://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/nes/index.html|archivedate=October 12, 1997}}</ref>\n\nUsing another approach to market the system to North American retailers as an \"entertainment system\", as opposed to a video game console, Nintendo positioned the NES more squarely as a toy, emphasizing the [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] [[light gun]], and more significantly, [[R.O.B.]] (Robotic Operating Buddy), a wireless [[toy robot]] that responds to special screen flashes with mechanized actions.<ref name=\"Rise of Nintendo\" /> Although R.O.B. successfully drew a stream of retailers to Nintendo's Summer 1985 CES booth to see the NES, they were still unwilling to sign up to distribute the console.<ref name=\"goldberg\" />\n\n====North American launch (1985-1986)====\n{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | text=Mr. Arakawa really had this focus ... if it's going to work in New York, it will spread.

In 1987, [[NEC]] and [[Hudson Soft]] released the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], and in 1988, [[Sega]] released the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[Mega Drive]]. Both were introduced in North America in 1989, where they were respectively marketed as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis. Facing new competition from the PC Engine in Japan, and the Genesis in North America, Nintendo's market share began to erode. Nintendo responded in the form of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] (Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe), the Famicom's 16-bit successor, in 1990. Although Nintendo announced its intention to continue to support the Famicom alongside its newer console, the success of the newer offering began to draw even more gamers and developers from the NES, whose decline accelerated. Nintendo did continue support of the NES for about three years after the September 1991 release of the Super NES, with the NES's final [[First-party developer|first-party]] games being ''[[Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II]]'' and ''[[Wario's Woods]]''.\n\nA revised Famicom (HVC-101 model) was released in Japan in 1993. It takes some design cues from the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. The HVC-101 model replaces the original HVC-001 model's [[RF modulator]] with [[RCA connector|RCA]] [[composite video|composite audio/video]] output, eliminates the hardwired controllers, and features a more compact case design. Retailing for \u00a54,800 to \u00a57,200 (equivalent to approximately $42 to $60 USD), the HVC-101 model remained in production for almost a decade before being finally discontinued in 2003.<ref name=\"avfami\">{{cite web |title=AV Family Computer |website={{!}}tsr's NES archive | url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/fc/avfami.html |accessdate=February 12, 2006}}</ref> The case design of the AV Famicom was adopted for a subsequent North American rerelease of the NES.

Even though the NES was discontinued in North America in 1995, many millions of cartridges for the system existed. The secondhand market of video rental stores, thrift stores, yard sales, flea markets, and games repackaged by Game Time Inc. / Game Trader Inc. and sold at retail stores such as [[K-Mart]], was burgeoning. Many people began to rediscover the NES around this time, and by 1997, many older NES games were becoming popular with collectors.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAt the same time, [[computer programmer]]s began to develop [[Console emulator|emulators]] capable of reproducing the internal workings of the NES on modern personal computers. When paired with a [[ROM image]] (a [[bit]]-for-bit copy of a NES cartridge's program code), the games can be played on a computer.

Following the North American [[video game crash of 1983]], the Famicom was adapted into the NES which was brazenly launched in North America in 1985. Transitioning the company from its [[arcade game]] history into this combined global [[8-bit]] [[home video game console]] platform, the Famicom and NES continued to aggressively compete with the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|next-generation 16-bit consoles]] including the 1988 [[Sega Genesis]]. The platform was succeeded by the Super Famicom in 1990 and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1991, but its support and production continued until 1995. Interest in the NES has been renewed by collectors and [[Console emulator|emulators]], including Nintendo's own [[Virtual Console]] platform.\n\n==Origins (1982\u20131984)==\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Console-Set-FL.png|thumb|Family Computer (Japan)]]\nThe North American video game market experienced a period of rapid growth and unprecedented popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Intellivision]] proved to be wildly popular, and many third-party developers arose in their wake to exploit the growing industry. Nintendo was one such development studio, and, by 1982 had found success with a number of [[arcade game]]s, such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', which was in turn ported to, and packaged with the [[ColecoVision]] console in North America.\n\nLed by [[Masayuki Uemura]], Nintendo's R&D team had been secretly working on a system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance that could not be surpassed by its competitors for at least a year.<ref name=\"Turner/Nutt 2\">{{Cite book |last=Turner |first=Benjamin |last2=Nutt |first2=Christian |date=July 15, 2003 |chapter=Building the Ultimate Game Machine |chapter-url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |title=Nintendo Famicom: 20 Years of Fun! |publisher=GameSpy |page=7 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805160509/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |archive-date=August 5, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Uemura initially thought of using a modern [[16-bit]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], but instead settled on the inexpensive [[MOS Technology 6502]], supplementing it with a custom [[graphics processing unit|graphics chip]] (the [[Picture Processing Unit]]).<ref name=\"liedholm1\" /> To keep costs down, suggestions of including a [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], [[modem]], and [[floppy disk]] drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-[[pin]] expansion [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] connection on the front of the console for future add-on functionality such as [[peripheral device]]s.\n\nThe keyboard, [[Famicom Modem]], and [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]] would later be released as add-on peripherals, all utilizing the Famicom expansion port. Other peripheral devices connecting via the expansion port would include the [[NES Zapper|Famicom Light Gun]], [[Power Pad|Family Trainer]], and various specialized controllers.

In 1987, [[NEC]] and [[Hudson Soft]] released the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], and in 1988, [[Sega]] released the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[Mega Drive]]. Both were introduced in North America in 1989, where they were respectively marketed as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis. Facing new competition from the PC Engine in Japan, and the Genesis in North America, Nintendo's market share began to erode. Nintendo responded in the form of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] (Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe), the Famicom's 16-bit successor, in 1990. Although Nintendo announced its intention to continue to support the Famicom alongside its newer console, the success of the newer offering began to draw even more gamers and developers from the NES, whose decline accelerated. Nintendo did continue support of the NES for about three years after the September 1991 release of the Super NES, with the NES's final [[First-party developer|first-party]] games being ''[[Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II]]'' and ''[[Wario's Woods]]''.\n\nA revised Famicom (HVC-101 model) was released in Japan in 1993. It takes some design cues from the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. The HVC-101 model replaces the original HVC-001 model's [[RF modulator]] with [[RCA connector|RCA]] [[composite video|composite audio/video]] output, eliminates the hardwired controllers, and features a more compact case design. Retailing for \u00a54,800 to \u00a57,200 (equivalent to approximately $42 to $60 USD), the HVC-101 model remained in production for almost a decade before being finally discontinued in 2003.<ref name=\"avfami\">{{cite web |title=AV Family Computer |website={{!}}tsr's NES archive | url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/fc/avfami.html |accessdate=February 12, 2006}}</ref> The case design of the AV Famicom was adopted for a subsequent North American rerelease of the NES.

Even though the NES was discontinued in North America in 1995, many millions of cartridges for the system existed. The secondhand market of video rental stores, thrift stores, yard sales, flea markets, and games repackaged by Game Time Inc. / Game Trader Inc. and sold at retail stores such as [[K-Mart]], was burgeoning. Many people began to rediscover the NES around this time, and by 1997, many older NES games were becoming popular with collectors.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAt the same time, [[computer programmer]]s began to develop [[Console emulator|emulators]] capable of reproducing the internal workings of the NES on modern personal computers. When paired with a [[ROM image]] (a [[bit]]-for-bit copy of a NES cartridge's program code), the games can be played on a computer. Emulators also come with a variety of built-in functions that change the gaming experience, such as [[Saved game|save states]] which allow the player to save and resume progress at an exact spot in the game.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nNintendo did not respond positively to these developments and became one of the most vocal opponents of ROM image trading.

{"title_page": "LaGrand case", "text_new": "{{Morefootnotes|date=February 2008}}\n\nThe '''LaGrand case''' was a legal action heard before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) which concerned the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. In the case, the ICJ found that its own temporary court orders were legally binding and that the rights contained in the convention could not be denied by the application of domestic legal procedures.\n\n==Background==\nOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz (October 20, 1963 - February 24, 1999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (January 26, 1962 - March 3, 1999) bungled an armed bank robbery in [[Marana, Arizona]], United States, killing a man and severely injuring a woman in the process. They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands were German nationals, having been born from a German mother in Germany. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had officially obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to [[consular assistance]], under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However the Arizona authorities failed to do this even after they became aware that the LaGrands were German nationals. The LaGrand brothers later contacted the German consulate of their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions on the grounds that they were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of [[procedural default]], which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.\n\nDiplomatic efforts, including pleas by German ambassador [[J\u00fcrgen Chrobog]] and German Member of Parliament [[Claudia Roth]], and the recommendation of Arizona's clemency board, failed to sway Arizona Governor [[Jane Dee Hull]], who insisted that the executions be carried out.<ref>Mark Shaffer, \"No reprieve for German killer: International focus on Arizona case\", ''The Arizona Republic'', p. 1A, February 24, 1999</ref> Karl LaGrand was subsequently executed by the state of Arizona on February 24, 1999, by lethal injection. Walter LaGrand was executed March 3, 1999, by [[gas chamber|lethal gas]], and currently remains the last person executed by that method in the United States.<ref>''http://www.executedtoday.com/2008/03/03/1999-walter-lagrand/''</ref>\n\n==The case==\nGermany then initiated legal action in the International Court of Justice against the United States regarding Walter LaGrand. Hours before Walter LaGrand was due to be executed, Germany applied for the Court to grant a provisional court order, requiring the United States to delay the execution of Walter LaGrand, which the court granted.\n\nGermany then initiated action in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] for enforcement of the provisional order. In its judgment,<ref>''(Federal Republic of Germany et al. vs. United States et al., 526 U.S. 111, per curiam)''</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction with respect to Germany's complaint against Arizona due to the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitution]], which prohibits federal courts from hearing lawsuits of foreign states against a U.S. state. With respect to Germany's case against the United States, it held that the doctrine of procedural default was not incompatible with the Vienna Convention, and that even if procedural default did conflict with the Vienna Convention it had been overruled by later federal law &ndash; the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], which explicitly legislated the doctrine of procedural default. (Subsequent federal legislation overrides prior [[self-executing treaty]] provisions, ''[[Whitney v. Robertson]]'', {{ussc|124|190|1888}}).\n\nThe [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] sent a letter to the Supreme Court, as part of these proceedings, arguing that provisional measures of the International Court of Justice are not legally binding. The [[United States Department of State]] also conveyed the ICJ's provisional measure to the Governor of Arizona without comment. The Arizona clemency board recommended a stay to the governor, on the basis of the pending ICJ case; but the Governor of Arizona ignored the recommendation. \n\nGermany then modified its complaint in the case before the ICJ, alleging furthermore that the U.S. violated international law by failing to implement the provisional measures. In opposition to the German submissions, the United States argued that the Vienna Convention did not grant rights to individuals, only to states; that the convention was meant to be exercised subject to the laws of each state party, which in the case of the United States meant subject to the doctrine of procedural default; and that Germany was seeking to turn the ICJ into an international court of criminal appeal.\n\n==ICJ decision==\nOn June 27, 2001, the ICJ, rejecting all of the United States' arguments, ruled in favor of Germany. The ICJ held that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of April 24, 1963, granted rights to individuals on the basis of its plain meaning, and that domestic laws could not limit the rights of the accused under the convention, but only specify the means by which those rights were to be exercised. The ICJ also found that its own provisional measures were legally binding. The nature of provisional measures has been a subject of great dispute in international law;{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} the English text of the Statute of the International Court of Justice implies they are not binding, while the French text implies that they are. Faced with a contradiction between two equally authentic texts of the statute, the court considered which interpretation better served the objects and purposes of the statute, and hence found that they are binding. This was the first time in the court's history it had ruled as such.\n\nThe court also found that the United States violated the Vienna Convention through its application of procedural default. The court was at pains to point out that it was not passing judgment on the doctrine itself, but only its application to cases involving the Vienna Convention.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Avena case]]\n* ''[[Leal Garcia v.

In the case, the ICJ found that its own temporary court orders were legally binding and that the rights contained in the convention could not be denied by the application of domestic legal procedures.\n\n==Background==\nOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz (October 20, 1963 - February 24, 1999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (January 26, 1962 - March 3, 1999) bungled an armed bank robbery in [[Marana, Arizona]], United States, killing a man and severely injuring a woman in the process. They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands were German nationals, having been born from a German mother in Germany. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had officially obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to [[consular assistance]], under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However the Arizona authorities failed to do this even after they became aware that the LaGrands were German nationals. The LaGrand brothers later contacted the German consulate of their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions on the grounds that they were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of [[procedural default]], which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.\n\nDiplomatic efforts, including pleas by German ambassador [[J\u00fcrgen Chrobog]] and German Member of Parliament [[Claudia Roth]], and the recommendation of Arizona's clemency board, failed to sway Arizona Governor [[Jane Dee Hull]], who insisted that the executions were carried out.<ref>Mark Shaffer, \"No reprieve for German killer: International focus on Arizona case\", ''The Arizona Republic'', p. 1A, February 24, 1999</ref> Karl LaGrand was subsequently executed by the state of Arizona on February 24, 1999, by lethal injection. Walter LaGrand was executed March 3, 1999, by [[gas chamber|lethal gas]], and currently remains the last person executed by that method in the United States.<ref>''http://www.executedtoday.com/2008/03/03/1999-walter-lagrand/''</ref>\n\n==The case==\nGermany then initiated legal action in the International Court of Justice against the United States regarding Walter LaGrand. Hours before Walter LaGrand was due to be executed, Germany applied for the Court to grant a provisional court order, requiring the United States to delay the execution of Walter LaGrand, which the court granted.\n\nGermany then initiated action in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] for enforcement of the provisional order. In its judgment,<ref>''(Federal Republic of Germany et al. vs. United States et al., 526 U.S. 111, per curiam)''</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction with respect to Germany's complaint against Arizona due to the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitution]], which prohibits federal courts from hearing lawsuits of foreign states against a U.S. state. With respect to Germany's case against the United States, it held that the doctrine of procedural default was not incompatible with the Vienna Convention, and that even if procedural default did conflict with the Vienna Convention it had been overruled by later federal law &ndash; the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], which explicitly legislated the doctrine of procedural default. (Subsequent federal legislation overrides prior [[self-executing treaty]] provisions, ''[[Whitney v. Robertson]]'', {{ussc|124|190|1888}}).\n\nThe [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] sent a letter to the Supreme Court, as part of these proceedings, arguing that provisional measures of the International Court of Justice are not legally binding. The [[United States Department of State]] also conveyed the ICJ's provisional measure to the Governor of Arizona without comment. The Arizona clemency board recommended a stay to the governor, on the basis of the pending ICJ case; but the Governor of Arizona ignored the recommendation. \n\nGermany then modified its complaint in the case before the ICJ, alleging furthermore that the U.S. violated international law by failing to implement the provisional measures. In opposition to the German submissions, the United States argued that the Vienna Convention did not grant rights to individuals, only to states; that the convention was meant to be exercised subject to the laws of each state party, which in the case of the United States meant subject to the doctrine of procedural default; and that Germany was seeking to turn the ICJ into an international court of criminal appeal.\n\n==ICJ decision==\nOn June 27, 2001, the ICJ, rejecting all of the United States' arguments, ruled in favor of Germany. The ICJ held that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of April 24, 1963, granted rights to individuals on the basis of its plain meaning, and that domestic laws could not limit the rights of the accused under the convention, but only specify the means by which those rights were to be exercised. The ICJ also found that its own provisional measures were legally binding. The nature of provisional measures has been a subject of great dispute in international law;{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} the English text of the Statute of the International Court of Justice implies they are not binding, while the French text implies that they are. Faced with a contradiction between two equally authentic texts of the statute, the court considered which interpretation better served the objects and purposes of the statute, and hence found that they are binding. This was the first time in the court's history it had ruled as such.\n\nThe court also found that the United States violated the Vienna Convention through its application of procedural default. The court was at pains to point out that it was not passing judgment on the doctrine itself, but only its application to cases involving the Vienna Convention.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Avena case]]\n* ''[[Leal Garcia v.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That\u2019s not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \u201cgroaning\u201d within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what\u2019s happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there\u2019s a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

Anglican theologian and University of Oxford professor [[N.T. Wright]] characterised the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic as one that focuses on the Christian theme of [[lamentation]], in which both God and humanity mourn together:<ref name=\"Wright2020\">{{cite news |author1=[[N.T.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That\u2019s not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \u201cgroaning\u201d within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what\u2019s happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there\u2019s a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

The game is the second most popular card game in [[France]] and is also known in French-speaking [[Canada]]. \n\n== Background ==\nFrance is one of the first two countries outside of Italy to start playing tarot, the other being Switzerland. Historically, the tarot card game was played with the [[Italian playing cards|Italian suited]] [[Tarot of Marseilles]] deck<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Comprehensive Guide on the Tarot and Its Cards|last=Rockefeller|first=J.D.|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2016|isbn=9781523337828|location=|pages=}}</ref> which lacked reversible face cards and trumps and corner indices. For ease of play, a deck style known as the \"''[[Tarot Nouveau]]''\" or \"Bourgeois Tarot\" is used in the modern times. This deck, which began to appear around the late 19th century, uses [[French playing cards|French suits]] and replaces the traditional Renaissance allegorical images of the ''atouts'' with depictions of typical ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' [[genre scenes]] of French life and leisure. \n\nIn English, the game is referred to as the '''French tarot'''. This is done to differentiate the card game from other uses of the tarot deck that are more familiar in the Americas and English-speaking countries, particularly the decks used for [[cartomancy]] and other [[divination|divinatory]] purposes, and also to distinguish it from other card games played with a tarot deck. The unique feature that distinguishes French tarot from other forms of tarot games is the over-trumping rule.\n\n== Official rules ==\nTarot became the second-most popular card game in France since the latter part of the 20th century, trailing only the [[Belote]].  Part of the reason why the French tarot game persisted is the fact that the rules have been very consistent wherever the game is played.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett pg. 300 - Oxford University Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}</ref> \n\nWhile various types of tarot games were played in France since the 16th century, the dominant form now popular is the 19th-century rule set from [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=195-244|ref=History}}</ref> However, it is important to note that details of gameplay outside of officially sanctioned tournaments may vary from circle to circle so that the known rules and terminologies are more typical than definitive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|last=Parlett|first=David|publisher=Penguin|year=2008|isbn=9780141916101|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Deck ==\n[[File:Tarot card values.jpg|thumb|Card values in French tarot]]\nThe game of tarot is played using a 78-card [[tarot]] deck. This deck is composed of:\n\n* 21 numbered [[trump (card games)|trump]] cards (''atouts''),  and 1 unnumbered trump card: the \"Excuse\" or \"Fool\" (''L'excuse'' or ''Fou'')\n* 3 of which (''oudlers'') are trumps with particular importance: the 1 of trumps, the 21 of trumps and the \"Excuse\" (or Fool) as these determine the contract the taker commits to in that particular game.  \n* 4 [[suit (cards)|suit]]s of 14 cards each: \n** numbered \"[[pip cards]]\" (aka 'fillers') from 1 to 10 have no true value, except when taking its \"fold\" or add .5 point at counting (the \"Ace\" has always the lowest value and so it is marked with number 1 instead of the \"A\" common in 52-card decks),\n** four \"[[face cards]]\"; the ''{{linktext|Valet}}'' (Jack), ''{{linktext|Cavalier}}'' ([[Knight (playing card)|Knight]]; not seen in [[Standard 52-card deck|52-card deck]]s), ''{{linktext|Dame}}'' (Queen) and ''{{linktext|Roi}}'' (King) are respectively worth 2, 3, 4 and 5 points at end of match counting.\n\n=== Rank of cards ===\nThree cards known as ''{{linktext|oudlers}}'' (\"honors\") are of particular importance in the game: the 1 of trumps (''le {{linktext|petit}}'' or \"Little one\"), the 21 of trumps (''le {{linktext|monde}}'' or \"The World\", a holdover from the name of this card in the Tarot of Marseilles), and the ''Excuse'' (the Fool). These cards, when captured by the high bidder, lower the point threshold needed to fulfill the contract.  In colloquial French, ''oudlers'' are often referred to as ''bouts'' (ends).\n\nThe ranking of the hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades from the top is: King, Queen, Knight, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (Ace).\n\nAs an aside, the trumps and Fool can be removed to yield a 56-card deck very similar to a [[Playing card#French|52-card French deck]] but with the additional ''Cavalier'' (knight, lit. horseman) court card in each suit. This deck configuration, plus the Fool, was copied using culture-neutral card designs and values to create the deck for the [[Rook (card game)|Rook]] game.\n\n=== ''Excuse'' ===\n\nThe only card with a special effect is the \"Fool\", ''L'Excuse''. The ''{{linktext|Excuse}}'' may be played on any trick; it \"excuses\" the player from following suit. However, it normally doesn't win the trick. The card also normally remains the property of the person who played it, not the winner of that trick; to compensate for this in the scoring count, the owner of the ''Excuse'' should instead give the winner of the trick a half-point card (a trump other than an ''oudler'', or a suited number card; see [[French tarot#Scoring|Scoring]]) from his or her score pile.\n\nTwo common exceptions to the above behaviors are seen when the ''Excuse'' is played on the last trick, and what happens depends on whether the side playing the Fool has taken all the previous tricks (see ''{{linktext|Chelem}}''/Slam below). If the side has taken all previous tricks, the card takes the last trick; if not, it changes hands to the other side, even if the trick is won by a partner or fellow defender of the person playing it.\n\n== Rules ==\n[[File:(Saison 1958-1959). Foot. TFC - 53Fi6492.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Cahuzac]] and [[Ernest Schultz]] playing French tarot.]]\nFor 3 or 4 players (5 with a simple variation). The 4-player variant is usually considered the most challenging and is the one played in competitions. The following rules are for 4 players.\n\n=== Dealing ===\nPlayers draw for the first deal; the person with the lowest-value card deals first, with suits ordered spades > hearts > diamonds > clubs as a tiebreaker. All trumps rank higher than any suited card; anyone who draws the Fool must redraw. From this point, the deal will pass to the right (counterclockwise) for each subsequent deal.\n\nThe player at the left of the dealer cuts the deck. The dealer then deals out the entire deck, counter-clockwise, starting with the player on their right. Each player is dealt their cards in \"packets\" of three consecutive cards at a time (they will each receive 6 such packets for a total of 18 cards). In addition, a ''{{linktext|chien}}'' (lit. \"dog\", alt. \"kitty\", \"talon\" or \"nest\") of 6 cards is dealt one card at a time into the center of the table, while dealing to the other players. A card may be dealt to the dog at any time, but the dealer may not:\n\n* deal the dog two consecutive cards,\n* deal the dog a card from the middle of a player's \"packet\", or\n* deal the first or last card of the deck to the dog.\n\nA common valid dealing order is player A \u2192 player B \u2192 dog \u2192 player C \u2192 dealer, but this is just one possible permutation and the dealer is free to invent his own while following the above rules.\n\nA ''{{linktext|maldonne}}'' (misdeal) occurs when the dealer makes mistakes in the dealing; if this happens, the hand is redealt, either by the same dealer or the next in rotation. Players inspect, sort and evaluate their hands, and then move on to the bidding round.\n\n=== ''{{linktext|Petit| sec}}'' ===\nA player in possession of the Petit (1 of trump) but neither any other trump nor the Fool must announce this fact; the hand is voided and this round will be redealt by the next dealer.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fftarot.fr/index.php/Decouvrir/La-distribution.html |title= Le petit sec |accessdate= 2010-11-25 |work= La distribution |publisher= F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot |language= fr |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720215814/http://www.fftarot.fr/index.php/Decouvrir/La-distribution.html |archive-date= 2011-07-20 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Common house rules also allow a player to declare a ''maldonne'' if their hand has no trumps, or fewer than a given number of combined trumps and face cards.\n\n=== Bidding ===\nThe players look at the cards they have been dealt, and an auction begins, starting from the player to the right of the dealer, as all action proceeds counter-clockwise. By bidding, a player states their confidence that they will be able to meet a set contract (see [[French tarot#Scoring|below]]) and sets the terms by which they will try to do so. If a player does not wish to bid, they may \"pass\" but may not bid after having passed previously. One may only bid higher than the previous bidders. The ''preneur'' (\"taker\", sometimes called \"declarer\" as in [[Contract Bridge|Bridge]]) is the one who wins this auction; they must try to meet the contract while all other players form the \"defense\" and attempt to prevent the taker from doing so.\n\nThe level of player's bid is based on the strength of their hand, usually estimated by counting the points within it. See [[French tarot#Evaluating one's hand|evaluating one's hand]] below for a method to determine the points within one's hand.\n\nThe bids are, in increasing importance:\n*'''''{{linktext|Prise}}''''' (\"take\") or '''''{{linktext|petite}}''''' (\"small\"): if this is the winning bid the taker adds the \"dog\" to their hand, then confidentially sets aside a same number of cards of their choice, to bring their hand back to normal size before play begins. The discarded cards form the beginning of the taker's score pile (the tricks pile). The name of this stack evolves from \"le chien\" to \"l'\u00e9cart\" (\"the aside\").\n*'''''{{linktext|Pousse}}''''' (\"push\"): same actions and scoring as a ''prise'', but outranks the ''prise'' and generally indicates a stronger hand value. This bid is not in the official rules, and is a holdover from an older bidding system (see below).\n*'''''{{linktext|Garde}}''''' (\"guard\"): the same actions as ''prise'', but the taker wins or loses double the usual stake.\n*'''''{{linktext|Garde| sans}}''''' (\"guard without\" the dog): the dog goes directly into the taker's score pile, and no-one gets to see it until the end of the hand. The score is counted normally against the target number, but it is worth double the ''garde'' score (4x the base hand score) to whoever wins the hand.\n*'''''{{linktext|Garde| contre}}''''' (\"guard against\" the dog): the dog goes directly into the opposing score pile, without being shown until the end of the hand. The score is counted normally against the target number, but it is worth triple the ''garde'' score (6x the base hand score) to whomever wins the hand.\n\nIf no one bids, the hand is void and the deal passes to the right of the current dealer.\n\nOn a ''prise'', ''pousse'' or ''garde'', the taker may not set aside a king or a trump, except that if the player cannot discard anything else, they may discard a non-''oudler'' trump.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://fftarot.fr/index.php/Decouvrir/Le-Chien-et-l-ecart.html |title= Le chien et l'\u00e9cart |accessdate= 2008-08-23 |work= Formation |publisher= F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot |language=fr}}</ref> In this case, the taker has to display which trumps they set aside. An ''oudler'' may never be set aside.\n\nIn earlier rules, still played outside of competitions, in place of the ''prise'' and simple ''garde'', there were two bids, in increasing importance: the ''petite'' (small) and the ''pousse'' (push). The ''prise'' is still sometimes known as ''petite''. There are also some players who play without the ''prise'' contract, with ''garde'' as the minimum allowable bid.\n\n=== Main phase ===\n\nThe player to the right of the dealer leads the first trick, and the play proceeds counter-clockwise, with every player playing a card from his hand to the trick. Tricks are evaluated in a similar fashion as other trick-taking games with a trump suit; the highest trump, if played, takes the trick, and if trump is not played, the highest-value card of the led suit takes the trick. Every subsequent trick is led by the player who took the last trick. The leader of a trick can play any card they like.\n\nOnce the leader of a trick has played a card, everyone else must ''follow suit'' (play a card of that same suit, if they have one). If the first card played in a trick is the Fool, the required suit to follow is determined by the following card. If a player cannot follow suit, he must play a trump card if able, and additionally, the player is compelled to play a higher trump than any existing trump in the trick if he is able (The \"Petit\" or 1 is valued lowest, and the \"Monde\" or 21 is valued highest). If a player must trump but cannot overtrump, they can play any trump. If a player cannot follow suit or trump, he may play any card to the trick, however any card they play in such a situation cannot win the trick.\n\nIf the trick is led with a trump, all other players must play a trump, and each trump must exceed the rank of all trump previously played in the trick if possible. If this is not possible, a lower-ranked trump, or any card if the player has no trumps, can be played.\n\nThe Fool (''L'Excuse'') may be played to any trick, instead of following suit or trumping.  The Fool never wins the trick, unless it is played to the last trick and the side playing it has taken every previous trick. However, it never changes sides, unless played to the last trick and the side playing it has ''not'' won every trick. After playing the Fool to a trick, the player who played it simply takes the Fool back, places it into their scoring pile and gives the side who took the trick an \"ordinary\" card (worth a half-point; see scoring below) from their scoring pile.\n\nThe official FFT tournament rules do not cover the public or private nature of the contents of scoring piles during play. Generally in trick-taking games, the contents of players' scoring piles are not public information during play of the hand, except in cases where a revoke is suspected (a player not following suit, trumping or overtrumping when it was possible for them to do so). A player is neither required to divulge the contents of his score pile, nor is he permitted to look through it except as necessary to find a half-point card to replace the Fool.\n\n=== Scoring ===\nWhen the last trick has been played, the round ends. The taker counts the number of ''oudlers'' and the point value of all cards in his scoring pile. Alternatively, if the taker has taken the majority of tricks, the defenders can pool their scoring piles and count their ''oudlers'' and points; the taker has all remaining points.\n\n==== Value of the cards ====\n\nCards for scoring purposes are divided into two groups: \"counters\" (face cards and ''oudlers'') and \"ordinary\" cards or ''cartes basses'' (any suited pip card, and any trump except the 1 and 21). Cards are paired, with each counter matched to an ordinary card, and remaining ordinary cards are also paired. The values of pairs are then counted and summed:\n*1 King or ''oudler'' + 1 ordinary card: 5 points\n*1 Queen + 1 ordinary card: 4 points\n*1 Knight + 1 ordinary card: 3 points\n*1 Jack + 1 ordinary card: 2 points\n*2 ordinary cards: 1 point\n\nEach card thus has an individual value; the pairing simply makes it easier to count points. If a card cannot be paired, because there are an odd number in the scoring pile (common with three or five players) or more counters than ordinary cards:\n*Kings and ''oudlers'' are worth {{frac|4|1|2}} points each;\n*Queens are worth {{frac|3|1|2}};\n*Knights are worth {{frac|2|1|2}};\n*Jacks are worth {{frac|1|1|2}};\n*All other cards are worth {{frac|1|2}} point.\n\n==== Winning ====\nThe number of points the taker needs depends on how many of the ''oudlers'' (Excuse, Petit, 21 of trumps) are among his won tricks.\n\n*With 3 ''oudlers'' the taker needs at least 36 card points to win;\n*With 2 ''oudlers'' the taker needs at least 41 card points to win;\n*With 1 ''oudler'' the taker needs at least 51 card points to win;\n*With none the taker needs at least 56 card points to win.\n\nThere are 91 points to be taken in a round, so if the taker has:\n*3 ''oudlers'', the defenders need at least {{frac|55|1|2}} card points to win;\n*2 ''oudlers'', the defenders need at least {{frac|50|1|2}} card points to win;\n*1 ''oudler'', the defenders need at least {{frac|40|1|2}} card points to win;\n*no ''oudler'', the defenders need at least {{frac|35|1|2}} card points to win.\n\n==== Updating the scorecard ====\nScoring in tarot is \"zero-sum\"; when one player gains points, one or more other players lose an equal number. \nTo calculate the basic \"hand score\" that is to be added or deducted, the scorer starts with a basic score of 25 points, then adds the absolute (non-negative) difference between the points earned by the taker and the threshold, and, if any, the ''{{linktext|Petit| au| bout}}'' bonus. This quantity is multiplied by the appropriate multiplier for the taker's bid level (see Bidding), and then two additional bonuses may be added if they apply; the ''{{linktext|poign\u00e9e}}'' or \"handful\" bonus, and the ''{{linktext|chelem}}'' or slam bonus (see below for descriptions of bonuses). Thus, calculation of the hand score is expressed by the formula\n\n:s = (25 + E + P) \u00d7 M + H + S\n\nwhere:\n*E = Extra Points (points above the target score, or below if the target score is not hit)\n*P = ''{{linktext|Petit| au| bout}}'' bonus (see below)\n*M = Multiplier (1, 2, 4, or 6 depending on the taker's bid level)\n*H = Handful bonus (see below)\n*S = Slam bonus (see below)\n\nIf the taker beats the target score, this hand score is deducted from the score of each defender. If the taker misses the target score, this score is added to the score of each defender. The opposite of the sum of the defenders' gain or loss is then added to or deducted from the taker's score to balance the scores; with four players, the taker will gain or lose three times the hand score depending on whether the taker made or missed the contract. The sum of all scores for each hand, and thus the sum of the running totals after each hand, should be zero.<ref name=\"fft1\">{{citation |author=F\u00e9deration Fran\u00e7ais de Tarot|title=R\u00e9glement Officiel du Tarot |publisher=France Cartes}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a Garde Sans bid with a simple handful won by player A by a margin of 12 points gives the following hand score: {{nowrap|((25 + 12 + 0) \u00d7 4) + 20 + 0}} = 168 points. This score is deducted from the scores of all defenders and the sum of this loss is added to the taker's score, hence the scorecard:\n*A +504\n*B \u2212168\n*C \u2212168\n*D \u2212168\n\nSome players prefer to round the scores to the nearest 10 points after each game, however care must be taken as the scores should still sum to zero. Rounding each of the above scores independently yields 500 \u2212 170 \u2212 170 \u2212 170 = \u221210. If rounding is to be done, the defenders' scores should be rounded and the taker's score adjusted accordingly. Doing so in the above example would make the taker's score 510, thus it balances out.\n\nThis is not the only scoring method; the alternative is seen below.\n\n====Soft shuffling====\n\nAfter each round, the cards are gathered, cut by the previous dealer, and dealt by the person to the right of the previous dealer. The cards are not commonly shuffled other than the \"soft shuffling\" that occurs as a natural result of playing the cards. By not shuffling, groups of desirable cards are kept together such that one person generally has a favorable enough hand to open the bidding. With shuffling between deals it is unlikely for any one player to be dealt a hand he is willing to bid on; this leads to multiple redeals before a hand is actually played.\n\n=== Bonuses ===\n\n==== {{linktext|Mis\u00e8re}} ====\nIf a player's hand contains no trumps or no court cards (roi, dame, cavalier, valet), the player can declare Mis\u00e8re, which gives the declarer 30 points and subtracts 10 from the other players scores. This bonus is a common house rule and is not considered \"official\" by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot for tournament purposes.\n\n==== ''{{linktext|Poign\u00e9e}}'' ====\nIf a player has 10 or more trumps in their hand, they can declare a single (10+), double (13+), or triple (15+) \"handful\" (''poign\u00e9e''), right before playing their first card. A single handful adds 20 to the scoring. Doubles and triples add 40 and 60, respectively. The bonus is always added to the hand score, so if a player thinks that his or her side may not win, they might not want to declare a handful, so as not to give the other side points. The declaring player must show at least the number of trump cards for the level of the bonus declared. The Fool counts as a trump for the purposes of declaring handfuls, but if shown it gives information to other players as it usually means that the declaring player has no additional trumps. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract.\n\n==== ''{{linktext|Petit| au| bout}}'' ====\nWhen the last trick contains the Petit (1 of trump), 10 points is added to or deducted from the hand score before multiplying. Whether it is added or subtracted depends on which would most benefit the side taking the trick with the ''Petit au bout'' (One at the End). Usually, when one side (taker or defense) makes ''Petit au bout'' but the other side was successful in either making or breaking contract, the bonus is subtracted; when one side is successful in the contract and also makes ''Petit au bout'', the bonus is added. If the side attempting the ''Petit au bout'' wins all the tricks, the player gets the ''petit au bout'' bonus if the Petit was played at the second to last trick (and won the trick) and the Fool was played at the last trick. This bonus is multiplied according to the contract; if the contract is Guard Without, the gain or loss for a single hand score is adjusted by 40 points one way or the other.\n\n==== ''{{linktext|Chelem}}'' ====\nTo Slam (in French, ''chelem'') is to take every trick in the round. \"Announced\" Slam (made while bidding in the auction) gains 400 points if made. It grants the taker the right (and obligation) to start the first trick. Otherwise, a non-announced Slam made by either the taker or the defense gains 200 points. Failure to fulfill a pre-declared Slam costs the announcer 200 points. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract.\n\n==== Petit Slam ====\n\"Petit Slam\" is a bid to take every trick but three. It is, like the ''mis\u00e8re'', unofficial. An unannounced Petit Slam is worth 150 points, while an announced slam can gain the taker 300 points or lose them 150 if they make or miss.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{cleanup|section|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Petit imprenable ===\nIn Untouchable One Of Trumps variant, the player who has no trump except the Petit can still play, but the Petit is played like the Fool; if it does not take the trick, it is given back to its owner in exchange for a half-point card.\n\n=== Three-player variant ===\nThe dog consists of six cards, each hand of 24 cards, dealt in packets of three. 13 trumps are needed for a single handful, 15 for a double handful, 18 for a triple.\n\n=== Five-player variant ===\nThe dog consists of three cards, each hand of 15 cards, dealt in packets of three. 8 trumps are needed for a single handful, 10 for a double, 13 for a triple. Before calling the dog and scoring his three cards, the taker calls the King of any suit. Whoever has that King becomes the taker's partner, and plays with him against the other players. If the taker has all four kings, he calls a queen. If the taker has all four kings and all four queens, he calls a knight. The taker must play alone if he has all kings, queens and knights.\n\nIn the [[Austria]]n tarot game of [[K\u00f6nigrufen]], this king-calling mechanism is used so that four-player play two against two.\n\nThe King is called ''before'' anything is done with the dog; therefore, the taker may call a King that is in the dog. In this case, the taker plays alone; he has technically called himself as partner if the dog's cards are to be integrated into the hand, and in any case no other player has that King in hand.\n\nIn scoring, the taker's partner gets one \"hand score\" added to or taken from his score if the taker makes or misses his contract. So, if taker beats the target score, each defender loses the hand score, the partner gains the hand score, and the taker gets twice the hand score. If he misses, the gains and losses are reversed.\n\n=== Alternative scoring ===\nIn this variant, there is no score multiplier but the base score (25) is variable:\n*10 for a Petit\n*20 for a Pousse\n*40 for a Garde\n*80 for a Garde Sans\n*160 for a Garde Contre\n\nAnother popular variant is setting the multiplier for the Garde Contre to 8 instead of 6.\n\n===Scoring with chips===\nA simple way to keep score, and to gamble in tarot, utilizes a number of [[poker chips]] or similar tokens. The bid levels correspond to 1, 2, 4, and 6/8 chips or units. Each player bids or raises by increasing the number of chips, similar to [[Poker]] but without the option of folding. Each player's wager remains in front of him, and the taker adds an extra matching stack for each defender. If the taker wins, he gets all the chips on the table. If the taker loses, the defenders divide the chips evenly.\n\nRules on what happens when someone runs out of chips or cannot cover the current wager vary. Most often the player who is short cannot win more than was wagered; if the taker is short and wins, he only wins an equal stack from each defender. If he loses, the defenders split his chips as evenly as possible. If a defender is short, the taker can only win, and must only cover, the amount the defender has remaining. The game may end when someone runs out, in which case the person with the most chips wins. Alternatively, play may continue, with the chip values of each bid level increased. The player who has run out must still play, and may or may not be able to win chips by helping to set the taker.\n\n== Strategy ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special hands\n!Term\n!English\n!Definition\n|-\n|Coupe franche\n|void\n|Having no card in a particular suit\n|-\n|Singlette\n|rowspan=3|singleton\n|rowspan=3|Having one card in a particular suit\n|-\n|Demi-coupe\n|-\n|Fausse coupe\n|-\n|Filante\n|rowspan=2|Being long in a suit\n|rowspan=2|Having many cards in a particular suit.\n|-\n|Longue\n|}\n\n=== Evaluating one's hand ===\nAs a guide to bidding, a player can award points for various features of his hand, judging his bid according to the total number of points.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Feature\n! align=\"right\" | Pts\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"top\" | The oudlers\n| colspan=\"2\" | the 21\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | the fool\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\" | the petit\n| with 1-3 trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n| with 4 trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|-\n| with 5 trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 7\n|-\n| with 6+ trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 9\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The trumps\n| colspan=\"2\" | for each trump (oudlers included) unless there are less than 4 of them\n| align=\"right\" | 2\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | for each major trump (16 to 21)\n| align=\"right\" | 2\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | for each major trump in a sequence, e.g. 20,21 = 2 points or 16,17,18 = 3 points\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\" | The major suited cards\n| colspan=\"2\" | king and queen of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a king without queen\n| align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a queen without king\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a knight\n| align=\"right\" | 2\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a jack\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The suits\n| colspan=\"2\" | 5 cards of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | 6 cards of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 7\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | 7+ cards of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 9\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | For garde sans or garde contre\n| colspan=\"2\" | no card of a suit\n| align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | only one card of a suit\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|}\n\nEach range of point totals suggests a different bid:\n:less than 40 points: Passe (no bid)\n:40 to 55 points: Prise\n:56 to 70 points: Garde\n:71 to 80 points: Garde Sans\n:80+ points: Garde Contre\n\n=== Getting the Petit ===\nIt is essential to try to get the Petit if one can. In a 5-player game, if the taker has the 21 of trump, he shall always play it so his partner can secure the Petit if he's got it. If the taker has many trumps, he can perform a ''chasse au petit'' (Petit hunt), trying to play his trumps so that the Petit owner has no choice but to give it away.\n\n=== Observation ===\nEvery player should know which suits have been played, and which are still to be played. It is useful to count how many trumps, and what kings, have been played.\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n==== Distribution of suits ====\nThe following table shows the maximum number of suits and trumps for a Defender for 4 players.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Number of cards of a suit the Taker doesn't have\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 11\n| align=\"center\" | 12\n| align=\"center\" | 13\n| align=\"center\" | 14\n| align=\"center\" | 15\n| align=\"center\" | 16\n|-\n| 2\n| 66.7%\n| 37.0%\n| 12.4%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n|29.6%\n|49.4%\n|57.6%\n|48.0%\n|25.6%\n| 8.5%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n| 3.7%\n|12.3%\n|24.7%\n|38.4%\n|48.0%\n|48.0%\n|37.3%\n|19.5%\n| 6.5%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n|\n| 1.2%\n| 4.9%\n|11.5%\n|20.5%\n|30.7%\n|39.7%\n|43.8%\n|40.7%\n|30.5%\n|15.8%\n| 5.3%\n|\n|-\n|6\n|\n|\n| 0.4%\n| 1.9%\n| 5.1%\n|10.2%\n|17.1%\n|25.0%\n|32.9%\n|38.4%\n|39.5%\n|35.2%\n|25.8%\n|-\n|7\n|\n|\n|\n| 0.1%\n| 1.7%\n| 2.2%\n| 4.9%\n| 8.9%\n|14.3%\n|20.7%\n|27.3%\n|33.1%\n|36.4%\n|-\n|8\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 0.3%\n| 0.9%\n| 2.2%\n| 4.5%\n| 7.7%\n|12.2%\n|17.1%\n|22.8%\n|-\n|9\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 0.1%\n| 0.4%\n| 1.0%\n| 2.2%\n| 4.0%\n| 6.6%\n|10.2%\n|-\n|10\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 0.1%\n| 0.4%\n| 1.0%\n| 2.0%\n| 3.6%\n|-\n|11\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 0.1%\n| 0.2%\n| 0.5%\n| 1.0%\n|-\n|12\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 0.1%\n| 0.2%\n|}\n\nExample: ''Suppose the taker has 8 hearts, thus the Defenders have 6 hearts.

An outline of the system follows.\n\n'''At the outset (indicated by 1 card)'''\n\n*In a suit:\n: A card from Ace to 5 signals that the player holds a major honor (King-Queen).\n: A card higher than the 5 signals that the player does not hold such an honor.\n\n*In trumps:\n: An odd trump signals possession of at least 7 trumps, and requests that partner play trumps.\n: An even trump played at the beginning of part announces possession of fewer than 7 trumps.\n\n'''With the Supply (indicated by 2 cards)'''\n\n*Suit played by the attacker:\n: Order going down: behavior 5th in the suit invites to play trump (attention not to have the Petit in hand).\n: The Excuse on starts attacker with the first or with the second turn promises the behavior\n\n*Suit played by defense:\n: Two cards of the same suit played in descending order signal that the player held a doubleton in this suit. The player's partner is implicitly expected to continue playing this suit so that the player can overtrump.\n\nWhen a player indicates the strength of his or her hand by playing a king or an odd trump, it imposes a line of play to which the partners are duty bound to adhere.\n\n: Excuse at the first round of trumps: Player demands an end to trumps.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://fftarot.fr/ ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7oise de Tarot''], official website of the French Tarot Federation.\n*[http://www.pagat.com/tarot/frtarot.html Rules of the game at pagat.com]\n*[http://trionfi.com/0/p/ general information on the game of tarot]\n*[http://www.shogix.net/ Shogix.net]\n*[http://www.angelfire.com/games5/atga/ American Tarot Game Association]\n*{{Webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20121202005201/http://community.livejournal.com/game_of_tarot/profile/ |date=December 2, 2012 |title=Game of Tarot livejournal community}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0DuML4wfWI&mode=user&search= Instructional video on French tarot]\n*[https://viptarot.fr/en/ Online platform to play Tarot]\n\n{{Tarot and Tarock card games}}\n[[Category:Tarot card games]]\n[[Category:French tarot| ]]\n[[Category:Four-player card games]]\n[[Category:French card games]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the French tarot card game||Tarot (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox card game\n| title = French Tarot\n| subtitle = A trick-taking game of the European [[tarot]] card game family\n| image_link = [[File:Oudlers1910.PNG|200px]]\n| image_caption = The 3 oudlers of the French Tarot Nouveau, circa 1910\n| alt_names = Tarot, ''Jeu de tarot''\n| type = [[Trick-taking]]\n| players = 4<br /> Variants for 3 or 5 players\n| ages = 12 and up\n| num_cards = 78\n| deck = [[Tarot Nouveau]]\n| play = Counter-clockwise\n| card_rank = Trump suit 21\u20131, Excuse<br /> R D C V 10\u20131\n| origin = [[France|French]] \n| related = [[Droggn]]\n| playing_time = 15 minutes per hand\n| random_chance = Moderate\n| skills = Card Counting, Tactics, Strategy\n| footnotes =\n}}\n\nThe French game of '''tarot''', also '''''jeu de tarot''''', is a [[Trick-taking game|trick-taking]] strategy [[tarot card game]] played by three to five players using a traditional 78-card [[tarot]] deck. The game is the second most popular card game in [[France]] and is also known in French-speaking [[Canada]]. \n\n== Background ==\nFrance is one of the first two countries outside of Italy to start playing tarot, the other being Switzerland. Historically, the tarot card game was played with the [[Italian playing cards|Italian suited]] [[Tarot of Marseilles]] deck<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Comprehensive Guide on the Tarot and Its Cards|last=Rockefeller|first=J.D.|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2016|isbn=9781523337828|location=|pages=}}</ref> which lacked reversible face cards and trumps and corner indices. For ease of play, a deck style known as the \"''[[Tarot Nouveau]]''\" or \"Bourgeois Tarot\" is used in the modern times. This deck, which began to appear around the late 19th century, uses [[French playing cards|French suits]] and replaces the traditional Renaissance allegorical images of the ''atouts'' with depictions of typical ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' [[genre scenes]] of French life and leisure. \n\nIn English, the game is referred to as the '''French tarot'''. This is done to differentiate the card game from other uses of the tarot deck that are more familiar in the Americas and English-speaking countries, particularly the decks used for [[cartomancy]] and other [[divination|divinatory]] purposes, and also to distinguish it from other card games played with a tarot deck. The unique feature that distinguishes French tarot from other forms of tarot games is the over-trumping rule.\n\n== Official rules ==\nTarot became the second-most popular card game in France since the latter part of the 20th century, trailing only the [[Belote]].  Part of the reason why the French tarot game persisted is the fact that the rules have been very consistent wherever the game is played.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett pg. 300 - Oxford University Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}</ref> \n\nWhile various types of tarot games were played in France since the 16th century, the dominant form now popular is the 19th-century rule set from [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=195-244|ref=History}}</ref> However, it is important to note that details of gameplay outside of officially sanctioned tournaments may vary from circle to circle so that the known rules and terminologies are more typical than definitive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|last=Parlett|first=David|publisher=Penguin|year=2008|isbn=9780141916101|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Deck ==\n[[File:Tarot card values.jpg|thumb|Card values in French tarot]]\nThe game of tarot is played using a 78-card [[tarot]] deck. This deck is composed of:\n\n* 21 numbered [[trump (card games)|trump]] cards (''atouts''),  and 1 unnumbered trump card: the \"Excuse\" or \"Fool\" (''L'excuse'' or ''Fou'')\n* 3 of which (''oudlers'') are trumps with particular importance: the 1 of trumps, the 21 of trumps and the \"Excuse\" (or Fool) as these determine the contract the taker commits to in that particular game.  \n* 4 [[suit (cards)|suit]]s of 14 cards each: \n** numbered \"[[pip cards]]\" (aka 'fillers') from 1 to 10 have no true value, except when taking its \"fold\" or add .5 point at counting (the \"Ace\" has always the lowest value and so it is marked with number 1 instead of the \"A\" common in 52-card decks),\n** four \"[[face cards]]\"; the ''{{linktext|Valet}}'' (Jack), ''{{linktext|Cavalier}}'' ([[Knight (playing card)|Knight]]; not seen in [[Standard 52-card deck|52-card deck]]s), ''{{linktext|Dame}}'' (Queen) and ''{{linktext|Roi}}'' (King) are respectively worth 2, 3, 4 and 5 points at end of match counting.\n\n=== Rank of cards ===\nThree cards known as ''{{linktext|oudlers}}'' (\"honors\") are of particular importance in the game: the 1 of trumps (''le {{linktext|petit}}'' or \"Little one\"), the 21 of trumps (''le {{linktext|monde}}'' or \"The World\", a holdover from the name of this card in the Tarot of Marseilles), and the ''Excuse'' (the Fool). These cards, when captured by the high bidder, lower the point threshold needed to fulfill the contract.  In colloquial French, ''oudlers'' are often referred to as ''bouts'' (ends).\n\nThe ranking of the hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades from the top is: King, Queen, Knight, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (Ace).\n\nAs an aside, the trumps and Fool can be removed to yield a 56-card deck very similar to a [[Playing card#French|52-card French deck]] but with the additional ''Cavalier'' (knight, lit. horseman) court card in each suit. This deck configuration, plus the Fool, was copied using culture-neutral card designs and values to create the deck for the [[Rook (card game)|Rook]] game.\n\n=== ''Excuse'' ===\n\nThe only card with a special effect is the \"Fool\", ''L'Excuse''. The ''{{linktext|Excuse}}'' may be played on any trick; it \"excuses\" the player from following suit. However, it normally doesn't win the trick. The card also normally remains the property of the person who played it, not the winner of that trick; to compensate for this in the scoring count, the owner of the ''Excuse'' should instead give the winner of the trick a half-point card (a trump other than an ''oudler'', or a suited number card; see [[French tarot#Scoring|Scoring]]) from his or her score pile.\n\nTwo common exceptions to the above behaviors are seen when the ''Excuse'' is played on the last trick, and what happens depends on whether the side playing the Fool has taken all the previous tricks (see ''{{linktext|Chelem}}''/Slam below). If the side has taken all previous tricks, the card takes the last trick; if not, it changes hands to the other side, even if the trick is won by a partner or fellow defender of the person playing it.\n\n== Rules ==\n[[File:(Saison 1958-1959). Foot. TFC - 53Fi6492.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Cahuzac]] and [[Ernest Schultz]] playing French tarot.]]\nFor 3 or 4 players (5 with a simple variation). The 4-player variant is usually considered the most challenging and is the one played in competitions. The following rules are for 4 players.\n\n=== Dealing ===\nPlayers draw for the first deal; the person with the lowest-value card deals first, with suits ordered spades > hearts > diamonds > clubs as a tiebreaker. All trumps rank higher than any suited card; anyone who draws the Fool must redraw. From this point, the deal will pass to the right (counterclockwise) for each subsequent deal.\n\nThe player at the left of the dealer cuts the deck. The dealer then deals out the entire deck, counter-clockwise, starting with the player on their right. Each player is dealt their cards in \"packets\" of three consecutive cards at a time (they will each receive 6 such packets for a total of 18 cards). In addition, a ''{{linktext|chien}}'' (lit. \"dog\", alt. \"kitty\", \"talon\" or \"nest\") of 6 cards is dealt one card at a time into the center of the table, while dealing to the other players. A card may be dealt to the dog at any time, but the dealer may not:\n\n* deal the dog two consecutive cards,\n* deal the dog a card from the middle of a player's \"packet\", or\n* deal the first or last card of the deck to the dog.\n\nA common valid dealing order is player A \u2192 player B \u2192 dog \u2192 player C \u2192 dealer, but this is just one possible permutation and the dealer is free to invent his own while following the above rules.\n\nA ''{{linktext|maldonne}}'' (misdeal) occurs when the dealer makes mistakes in the dealing; if this happens, the hand is redealt, either by the same dealer or the next in rotation. Players inspect, sort and evaluate their hands, and then move on to the bidding round.\n\n=== ''{{linktext|Petit| sec}}'' ===\nA player in possession of the Petit (1 of trump) but neither any other trump nor the Fool must announce this fact; the hand is voided and this round will be redealt by the next dealer.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fftarot.fr/index.php/Decouvrir/La-distribution.html |title= Le petit sec |accessdate= 2010-11-25 |work= La distribution |publisher= F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot |language= fr |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720215814/http://www.fftarot.fr/index.php/Decouvrir/La-distribution.html |archive-date= 2011-07-20 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Common house rules also allow a player to declare a ''maldonne'' if their hand has no trumps, or fewer than a given number of combined trumps and face cards.\n\n=== Bidding ===\nThe players look at the cards they have been dealt, and an auction begins, starting from the player to the right of the dealer, as all action proceeds counter-clockwise. By bidding, a player states their confidence that they will be able to meet a set contract (see [[French tarot#Scoring|below]]) and sets the terms by which they will try to do so. If a player does not wish to bid, they may \"pass\" but may not bid after having passed previously. One may only bid higher than the previous bidders. The ''preneur'' (\"taker\", sometimes called \"declarer\" as in [[Contract Bridge|Bridge]]) is the one who wins this auction; they must try to meet the contract while all other players form the \"defense\" and attempt to prevent the taker from doing so.\n\nThe level of player's bid is based on the strength of their hand, usually estimated by counting the points within it. See [[French tarot#Evaluating one's hand|evaluating one's hand]] below for a method to determine the points within one's hand.\n\nThe bids are, in increasing importance:\n*'''''{{linktext|Prise}}''''' (\"take\") or '''''{{linktext|petite}}''''' (\"small\"): if this is the winning bid the taker adds the \"dog\" to their hand, then confidentially sets aside a same number of cards of their choice, to bring their hand back to normal size before play begins. The discarded cards form the beginning of the taker's score pile (the tricks pile). The name of this stack evolves from \"le chien\" to \"l'\u00e9cart\" (\"the aside\").\n*'''''{{linktext|Pousse}}''''' (\"push\"): same actions and scoring as a ''prise'', but outranks the ''prise'' and generally indicates a stronger hand value. This bid is not in the official rules, and is a holdover from an older bidding system (see below).\n*'''''{{linktext|Garde}}''''' (\"guard\"): the same actions as ''prise'', but the taker wins or loses double the usual stake.\n*'''''{{linktext|Garde| sans}}''''' (\"guard without\" the dog): the dog goes directly into the taker's score pile, and no-one gets to see it until the end of the hand. The score is counted normally against the target number, but it is worth double the ''garde'' score (4x the base hand score) to whoever wins the hand.\n*'''''{{linktext|Garde| contre}}''''' (\"guard against\" the dog): the dog goes directly into the opposing score pile, without being shown until the end of the hand. The score is counted normally against the target number, but it is worth triple the ''garde'' score (6x the base hand score) to whomever wins the hand.\n\nIf no one bids, the hand is void and the deal passes to the right of the current dealer.\n\nOn a ''prise'', ''pousse'' or ''garde'', the taker may not set aside a king or a trump, except that if the player cannot discard anything else, they may discard a non-''oudler'' trump.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://fftarot.fr/index.php/Decouvrir/Le-Chien-et-l-ecart.html |title= Le chien et l'\u00e9cart |accessdate= 2008-08-23 |work= Formation |publisher= F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot |language=fr}}</ref> In this case, the taker has to display which trumps they set aside. An ''oudler'' may never be set aside.\n\nIn earlier rules, still played outside of competitions, in place of the ''prise'' and simple ''garde'', there were two bids, in increasing importance: the ''petite'' (small) and the ''pousse'' (push). The ''prise'' is still sometimes known as ''petite''. There are also some players who play without the ''prise'' contract, with ''garde'' as the minimum allowable bid.\n\n=== Main phase ===\n\nThe player to the right of the dealer leads the first trick, and the play proceeds counter-clockwise, with every player playing a card from his hand to the trick. Tricks are evaluated in a similar fashion as other trick-taking games with a trump suit; the highest trump, if played, takes the trick, and if trump is not played, the highest-value card of the led suit takes the trick. Every subsequent trick is led by the player who took the last trick. The leader of a trick can play any card they like.\n\nOnce the leader of a trick has played a card, everyone else must ''follow suit'' (play a card of that same suit, if they have one). If the first card played in a trick is the Fool, the required suit to follow is determined by the following card. If a player cannot follow suit, he must play a trump card if able, and additionally, the player is compelled to play a higher trump than any existing trump in the trick if he is able (The \"Petit\" or 1 is valued lowest, and the \"Monde\" or 21 is valued highest). If a player must trump but cannot overtrump, they can play any trump. If a player cannot follow suit or trump, he may play any card to the trick, however any card they play in such a situation cannot win the trick.\n\nIf the trick is led with a trump, all other players must play a trump, and each trump must exceed the rank of all trump previously played in the trick if possible. If this is not possible, a lower-ranked trump, or any card if the player has no trumps, can be played.\n\nThe Fool (''L'Excuse'') may be played to any trick, instead of following suit or trumping.  The Fool never wins the trick, unless it is played to the last trick and the side playing it has taken every previous trick. However, it never changes sides, unless played to the last trick and the side playing it has ''not'' won every trick. After playing the Fool to a trick, the player who played it simply takes the Fool back, places it into their scoring pile and gives the side who took the trick an \"ordinary\" card (worth a half-point; see scoring below) from their scoring pile.\n\nThe official FFT tournament rules do not cover the public or private nature of the contents of scoring piles during play. Generally in trick-taking games, the contents of players' scoring piles are not public information during play of the hand, except in cases where a revoke is suspected (a player not following suit, trumping or overtrumping when it was possible for them to do so). A player is neither required to divulge the contents of his score pile, nor is he permitted to look through it except as necessary to find a half-point card to replace the Fool.\n\n=== Scoring ===\nWhen the last trick has been played, the round ends. The taker counts the number of ''oudlers'' and the point value of all cards in his scoring pile. Alternatively, if the taker has taken the majority of tricks, the defenders can pool their scoring piles and count their ''oudlers'' and points; the taker has all remaining points.\n\n==== Value of the cards ====\n\nCards for scoring purposes are divided into two groups: \"counters\" (face cards and ''oudlers'') and \"ordinary\" cards or ''cartes basses'' (any suited pip card, and any trump except the 1 and 21). Cards are paired, with each counter matched to an ordinary card, and remaining ordinary cards are also paired. The values of pairs are then counted and summed:\n*1 King or ''oudler'' + 1 ordinary card: 5 points\n*1 Queen + 1 ordinary card: 4 points\n*1 Knight + 1 ordinary card: 3 points\n*1 Jack + 1 ordinary card: 2 points\n*2 ordinary cards: 1 point\n\nEach card thus has an individual value; the pairing simply makes it easier to count points. If a card cannot be paired, because there are an odd number in the scoring pile (common with three or five players) or more counters than ordinary cards:\n*Kings and ''oudlers'' are worth {{frac|4|1|2}} points each;\n*Queens are worth {{frac|3|1|2}};\n*Knights are worth {{frac|2|1|2}};\n*Jacks are worth {{frac|1|1|2}};\n*All other cards are worth {{frac|1|2}} point.\n\n==== Winning ====\nThe number of points the taker needs depends on how many of the ''oudlers'' (Excuse, Petit, 21 of trumps) are among his won tricks.\n\n*With 3 ''oudlers'' the taker needs at least 36 card points to win;\n*With 2 ''oudlers'' the taker needs at least 41 card points to win;\n*With 1 ''oudler'' the taker needs at least 51 card points to win;\n*With none the taker needs at least 56 card points to win.\n\nThere are 91 points to be taken in a round, so if the taker has:\n*3 ''oudlers'', the defenders need at least {{frac|55|1|2}} card points to win;\n*2 ''oudlers'', the defenders need at least {{frac|50|1|2}} card points to win;\n*1 ''oudler'', the defenders need at least {{frac|40|1|2}} card points to win;\n*no ''oudler'', the defenders need at least {{frac|35|1|2}} card points to win.\n\n==== Updating the scorecard ====\nScoring in tarot is \"zero-sum\"; when one player gains points, one or more other players lose an equal number. \nTo calculate the basic \"hand score\" that is to be added or deducted, the scorer starts with a basic score of 25 points, then adds the absolute (non-negative) difference between the points earned by the taker and the threshold, and, if any, the ''{{linktext|Petit| au| bout}}'' bonus. This quantity is multiplied by the appropriate multiplier for the taker's bid level (see Bidding), and then two additional bonuses may be added if they apply; the ''{{linktext|poign\u00e9e}}'' or \"handful\" bonus, and the ''{{linktext|chelem}}'' or slam bonus (see below for descriptions of bonuses). Thus, calculation of the hand score is expressed by the formula\n\n:s = (25 + E + P) \u00d7 M + H + S\n\nwhere:\n*E = Extra Points (points above the target score, or below if the target score is not hit)\n*P = ''{{linktext|Petit| au| bout}}'' bonus (see below)\n*M = Multiplier (1, 2, 4, or 6 depending on the taker's bid level)\n*H = Handful bonus (see below)\n*S = Slam bonus (see below)\n\nIf the taker beats the target score, this hand score is deducted from the score of each defender. If the taker misses the target score, this score is added to the score of each defender. The opposite of the sum of the defenders' gain or loss is then added to or deducted from the taker's score to balance the scores; with four players, the taker will gain or lose three times the hand score depending on whether the taker made or missed the contract. The sum of all scores for each hand, and thus the sum of the running totals after each hand, should be zero.<ref name=\"fft1\">{{citation |author=F\u00e9deration Fran\u00e7ais de Tarot|title=R\u00e9glement Officiel du Tarot |publisher=France Cartes}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a Garde Sans bid with a simple handful won by player A by a margin of 12 points gives the following hand score: {{nowrap|((25 + 12 + 0) \u00d7 4) + 20 + 0}} = 168 points. This score is deducted from the scores of all defenders and the sum of this loss is added to the taker's score, hence the scorecard:\n*A +504\n*B \u2212168\n*C \u2212168\n*D \u2212168\n\nSome players prefer to round the scores to the nearest 10 points after each game, however care must be taken as the scores should still sum to zero. Rounding each of the above scores independently yields 500 \u2212 170 \u2212 170 \u2212 170 = \u221210. If rounding is to be done, the defenders' scores should be rounded and the taker's score adjusted accordingly. Doing so in the above example would make the taker's score 510, thus it balances out.\n\nThis is not the only scoring method; the alternative is seen below.\n\n====Soft shuffling====\n\nAfter each round, the cards are gathered, cut by the previous dealer, and dealt by the person to the right of the previous dealer. The cards are not commonly shuffled other than the \"soft shuffling\" that occurs as a natural result of playing the cards. By not shuffling, groups of desirable cards are kept together such that one person generally has a favorable enough hand to open the bidding. With shuffling between deals it is unlikely for any one player to be dealt a hand he is willing to bid on; this leads to multiple redeals before a hand is actually played.\n\n=== Bonuses ===\n\n==== {{linktext|Mis\u00e8re}} ====\nIf a player's hand contains no trumps or no court cards (roi, dame, cavalier, valet), the player can declare Mis\u00e8re, which gives the declarer 30 points and subtracts 10 from the other players scores. This bonus is a common house rule and is not considered \"official\" by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot]] for tournament purposes.\n\n==== ''{{linktext|Poign\u00e9e}}'' ====\nIf a player has 10 or more trumps in their hand, they can declare a single (10+), double (13+), or triple (15+) \"handful\" (''poign\u00e9e''), right before playing their first card. A single handful adds 20 to the scoring. Doubles and triples add 40 and 60, respectively. The bonus is always added to the hand score, so if a player thinks that his or her side may not win, they might not want to declare a handful, so as not to give the other side points. The declaring player must show at least the number of trump cards for the level of the bonus declared. The Fool counts as a trump for the purposes of declaring handfuls, but if shown it gives information to other players as it usually means that the declaring player has no additional trumps. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract.\n\n==== ''{{linktext|Petit| au| bout}}'' ====\nWhen the last trick contains the Petit (1 of trump), 10 points is added to or deducted from the hand score before multiplying. Whether it is added or subtracted depends on which would most benefit the side taking the trick with the ''Petit au bout'' (One at the End). Usually, when one side (taker or defense) makes ''Petit au bout'' but the other side was successful in either making or breaking contract, the bonus is subtracted; when one side is successful in the contract and also makes ''Petit au bout'', the bonus is added. If the side attempting the ''Petit au bout'' wins all the tricks, the player gets the ''petit au bout'' bonus if the Petit was played at the second to last trick (and won the trick) and the Fool was played at the last trick. This bonus is multiplied according to the contract; if the contract is Guard Without, the gain or loss for a single hand score is adjusted by 40 points one way or the other.\n\n==== ''{{linktext|Chelem}}'' ====\nTo Slam (in French, ''chelem'') is to take every trick in the round. \"Announced\" Slam (made while bidding in the auction) gains 400 points if made. It grants the taker the right (and obligation) to start the first trick. Otherwise, a non-announced Slam made by either the taker or the defense gains 200 points. Failure to fulfill a pre-declared Slam costs the announcer 200 points. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract.\n\n==== Petit Slam ====\n\"Petit Slam\" is a bid to take every trick but three. It is, like the ''mis\u00e8re'', unofficial. An unannounced Petit Slam is worth 150 points, while an announced slam can gain the taker 300 points or lose them 150 if they make or miss.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{cleanup|section|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Petit imprenable ===\nIn Untouchable One Of Trumps variant, the player who has no trump except the Petit can still play, but the Petit is played like the Fool; if it does not take the trick, it is given back to its owner in exchange for a half-point card.\n\n=== Three-player variant ===\nThe dog consists of six cards, each hand of 24 cards, dealt in packets of three. 13 trumps are needed for a single handful, 15 for a double handful, 18 for a triple.\n\n=== Five-player variant ===\nThe dog consists of three cards, each hand of 15 cards, dealt in packets of three. 8 trumps are needed for a single handful, 10 for a double, 13 for a triple. Before calling the dog and scoring his three cards, the taker calls the King of any suit. Whoever has that King becomes the taker's partner, and plays with him against the other players. If the taker has all four kings, he calls a queen. If the taker has all four kings and all four queens, he calls a knight. The taker must play alone if he has all kings, queens and knights.\n\nIn the [[Austria]]n tarot game of [[K\u00f6nigrufen]], this king-calling mechanism is used so that four-player play two against two.\n\nThe King is called ''before'' anything is done with the dog; therefore, the taker may call a King that is in the dog. In this case, the taker plays alone; he has technically called himself as partner if the dog's cards are to be integrated into the hand, and in any case no other player has that King in hand.\n\nIn scoring, the taker's partner gets one \"hand score\" added to or taken from his score if the taker makes or misses his contract. So, if taker beats the target score, each defender loses the hand score, the partner gains the hand score, and the taker gets twice the hand score. If he misses, the gains and losses are reversed.\n\n=== Alternative scoring ===\nIn this variant, there is no score multiplier but the base score (25) is variable:\n*10 for a Petit\n*20 for a Pousse\n*40 for a Garde\n*80 for a Garde Sans\n*160 for a Garde Contre\n\nAnother popular variant is setting the multiplier for the Garde Contre to 8 instead of 6.\n\n===Scoring with chips===\nA simple way to keep score, and to gamble in tarot, utilizes a number of [[poker chips]] or similar tokens. The bid levels correspond to 1, 2, 4, and 6/8 chips or units. Each player bids or raises by increasing the number of chips, similar to [[Poker]] but without the option of folding. Each player's wager remains in front of him, and the taker adds an extra matching stack for each defender. If the taker wins, he gets all the chips on the table. If the taker loses, the defenders divide the chips evenly.\n\nRules on what happens when someone runs out of chips or cannot cover the current wager vary. Most often the player who is short cannot win more than was wagered; if the taker is short and wins, he only wins an equal stack from each defender. If he loses, the defenders split his chips as evenly as possible. If a defender is short, the taker can only win, and must only cover, the amount the defender has remaining. The game may end when someone runs out, in which case the person with the most chips wins. Alternatively, play may continue, with the chip values of each bid level increased. The player who has run out must still play, and may or may not be able to win chips by helping to set the taker.\n\n== Strategy ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Special hands\n!Term\n!English\n!Definition\n|-\n|Coupe franche\n|void\n|Having no card in a particular suit\n|-\n|Singlette\n|rowspan=3|singleton\n|rowspan=3|Having one card in a particular suit\n|-\n|Demi-coupe\n|-\n|Fausse coupe\n|-\n|Filante\n|rowspan=2|Being long in a suit\n|rowspan=2|Having many cards in a particular suit.\n|-\n|Longue\n|}\n\n=== Evaluating one's hand ===\nAs a guide to bidding, a player can award points for various features of his hand, judging his bid according to the total number of points.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Feature\n! align=\"right\" | Pts\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"top\" | The oudlers\n| colspan=\"2\" | the 21\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | the fool\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\" | the petit\n| with 1-3 trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n| with 4 trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|-\n| with 5 trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 7\n|-\n| with 6+ trumps\n| align=\"right\" | 9\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The trumps\n| colspan=\"2\" | for each trump (oudlers included) unless there are less than 4 of them\n| align=\"right\" | 2\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | for each major trump (16 to 21)\n| align=\"right\" | 2\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | for each major trump in a sequence, e.g. 20,21 = 2 points or 16,17,18 = 3 points\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\" | The major suited cards\n| colspan=\"2\" | king and queen of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a king without queen\n| align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a queen without king\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a knight\n| align=\"right\" | 2\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | a jack\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The suits\n| colspan=\"2\" | 5 cards of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 5\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | 6 cards of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 7\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | 7+ cards of the same suit\n| align=\"right\" | 9\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | For garde sans or garde contre\n| colspan=\"2\" | no card of a suit\n| align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | only one card of a suit\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|}\n\nEach range of point totals suggests a different bid:\n:less than 40 points: Passe (no bid)\n:40 to 55 points: Prise\n:56 to 70 points: Garde\n:71 to 80 points: Garde Sans\n:80+ points: Garde Contre\n\n=== Getting the Petit ===\nIt is essential to try to get the Petit if one can. In a 5-player game, if the taker has the 21 of trump, he shall always play it so his partner can secure the Petit if he's got it. If the taker has many trumps, he can perform a ''chasse au petit'' (Petit hunt), trying to play his trumps so that the Petit owner has no choice but to give it away.\n\n=== Observation ===\nEvery player should know which suits have been played, and which are still to be played.

An outline of the system follows.\n\n'''At the outset (indicated by 1 card)'''\n\n*In a suit:\n: A card from Ace to 5 signals that the player holds a major honor (King-Queen).\n: A card higher than the 5 signals that the player does not hold such an honor.\n\n*In trumps:\n: An odd trump signals possession of at least 7 trumps, and requests that partner play trumps.\n: An even trump played at the beginning of part announces possession of fewer than 7 trumps.\n\n'''With the Supply (indicated by 2 cards)'''\n\n*Suit played by the attacker:\n: Order going down: behavior 5th in the suit invites to play trump (attention not to have the Petit in hand).\n: The Excuse on starts attacker with the first or with the second turn promises the behavior\n\n*Suit played by defense:\n: Two cards of the same suit played in descending order signal that the player held a doubleton in this suit. The player's partner is implicitly expected to continue playing this suit so that the player can overtrump.\n\nWhen a player indicates the strength of his or her hand by playing a king or an odd trump, it imposes a line of play to which the partners are duty bound to adhere.\n\n: Excuse at the first round of trumps: Player demands an end to trumps.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://fftarot.fr/ ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7oise de Tarot''], official website of the French Tarot Federation.\n*[http://www.pagat.com/tarot/frtarot.html Rules of the game at pagat.com]\n*[http://trionfi.com/0/p/ general information on the game of tarot]\n*[http://www.shogix.net/ Shogix.net]\n*[http://www.angelfire.com/games5/atga/ American Tarot Game Association]\n*{{Webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20121202005201/http://community.livejournal.com/game_of_tarot/profile/ |date=December 2, 2012 |title=Game of Tarot livejournal community}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0DuML4wfWI&mode=user&search= Instructional video on French tarot]\n*[https://viptarot.fr/en/ Online platform to play Tarot]\n\n{{Tarot and Tarock card games}}\n[[Category:Tarot card games]]\n[[Category:French tarot| ]]\n[[Category:Four-player card games]]\n[[Category:French card games]]\n", "name_user": "Countakeshi", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed redlinks to deleted page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_tarot"}
