In the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, however, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.<ref name=enn>{{cite news |url=http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=13101&ref=rss |title=Florida Raises Ill-Fated Artificial Reefs |author=Loney, Jim |work=Reuters |date=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-10 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{See also|List of neighborhoods in Fort Lauderdale}}\nFort Lauderdale has a program for designating and recognizing neighborhoods.
