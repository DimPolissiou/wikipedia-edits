His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} It is surrounded by farms, small mountains, plains, and trees. Pililla is known as the Green Field Municipality of Rizal.\n\nPililla has preserved some religious and non-religious traditions such as the Santa Cruzan or Flores de Mayo, wherein men and women walk all over town with their gowns. Town Fiesta during the month of July is being visited by people from the city to experience the celebrations especially the amateur shows at night. Like other towns, Pililla holds basketball league competitions for youth during summer. Pililla is also a destination for road cyclists because of its asphalted road, specifically in Sitio Bugarin in Barangay Halayhayin.\n\n==History==\nPilang Munti (Pililla\u2019s pre-Hispanic name) was ruled by a leader named Salyan Maginto. His territory encompasses the modern-day jurisdiction of the municipalities of Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Jalajala. It was referenced as \u201c''munti''\u201d in contrast to the nearby and much larger town of [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the province of Laguna.\n\nCavada, a Spanish historian, revealed that in the year 1571, the Spanish forces conquered the towns along Laguna de Bay which they called \u201cRinconada de Moron\u201d and Pilang Munti was among these which surrendered to the superior force of the Spaniards. Pilang Munti was incorporated into the colonial administration of Morong, and thus, the town was called \"Pilang Morong\".\n\nIn 1572, the first Spanish missionary priests arrived at Pilang Morong. Since then, Christianity was spread by the Spanish priests and in 1582, Fr. Juan de Placencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa established a \u201cvisita\u201d barrio at Pilang Morong. The place was divided by the Spaniards into 5 \u201c''rancherias''\u201d:\n\n* Monte Tan-ay\n* Sitio Tigbi (Lulukong)\n* San Diego\n* Monte Yakat\n* Dolo Rio (Wawa)\n\nIn 1583, Pilang Morong became an independent municipality. \u201dPililla\u201d was given as the official name of the newly formed town. The name \u201cPililla\u201d arose from the diminutive rules in the Castillan language by modifying a name with \u201c''-illa''\u201d or \u201c''-illo''\u201d to indicate a smaller or younger version.\n\nIn 1599, 16 years after the town was given autonomy, the supreme government granted Pililla the authority to construct a church.\n\nIn 1600, the first church of cogon and bamboo was constructed in the Dolo Rio but this was burned and a church made of wood was constructed but this was also burned down with the whole town in 1632. Another church made of wood was built and this suffered the same fate in 1668. Two years later, the construction of the present church began. This was finished in 1673 and the edifice still stands up to the present.\n\nAs an autonomous town, Pililla encompassed several barrios including Tanay and Jalajala. Tanay separated from Pililla and became an independent town in 1606. Jalajala became a barrio of Pililla in 1676 but was separated and made an independent town in 1786. It was reincorporated as a barrio of Pililla in 1816, but 9 years later, it was once again separated from Pililla to become an independent municipality.\n\nOn December 4, 1837, an election of local officials was held in Pililla. The following towns participated in the said election: Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Jalajala and San Diego. The last town was a new town and is presumed to be either the barrio of Quisao, which has San Diego as its patron, or the barrio of Niogan.\n\nIn 1853, Pililla was separated from the province of Laguna to be incorporated into the newly created Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo. In 1857, it was given the new name Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong.\n\nOn March 10, 1861, two principales of San Diego presented to the government a request, on behalf of the residents of San Diego and the sitios of Mavia and Puang, that their territory be separated from Pililla and to create an independent town to be called Perez. Both the gobernadorcillo and the parish priest, as well as the gobernador politico-militar de Morong, favored the petition. However, it was disapproved by the Administracion Civil since the territory did not meet the pre-requisite of having at least 500 tributes, the said territory was having only 298 tributes at that time.\n\nOn July 9, 1885, the government received another petition from Cabeza de Barangay of San Diego requesting that it be made into a kind of self-governing barrio of Pililla, on account of its remoteness. On January 25, 1886, the government agreed to make San Diego into a \u201c''Visita con Teniente Absolute''\u201d, on condition that the barrio constructs the necessary public buildings. Thus, upon the fulfillment of the agreed condition, the government\u2019s approval went into effect on June 18 of that same year.\n\nIn 1896, the Katipuneros of Pililla and San Diego established their military camp at Rambo or Pabalang na Gubat.\n\nThree years later, on August 6, 1898, Pililla was incorporated in the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. During the existence of the Philippine Republic, San Diego became an independent town. On January 5, 1899, a fierce battle ensued between the American forces and the Filipino troops defending Pililla. The town was partially ravaged by fire and local troops had to retreat to the mountain of Tanay.\n\nThe towns of Pililla and San Diego were integrated into the newly created province of Rizal in June 1901. Two years later, the Philippine Commission, in line with its policy of economy and centralization, consolidated the towns of Pililla, San Diego and Jalajala with the seat of government in Pililla.\n\nThe first ''Capitan'' under the American regime was Regino Quitiong who was the ''alcalde'' from 1900 to 1901.\n\nOn September 20, 1907, Jalajala was separated from Pililla and became an independent municipality. Quisao, on the other hand, remained a barrio of Pililla up to the present.\n\nIn 1918, the population of Pililla was 2,776 and Quisao was 814. In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala.\n\nOn September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya.\n\nOn December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \"''tulisanes''\".\n\nDuring the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} It is surrounded by farms, small mountains, plains, and trees. Pililla is known as the Green Field Municipality of Rizal.\n\nPililla has preserved some religious and non-religious traditions such as the Santa Cruzan or Flores de Mayo, wherein men and women walk all over town with their gowns. Town Fiesta during the month of July is being visited by people from the city to experience the celebrations especially the amateur shows at night. Like other towns, Pililla holds basketball league competitions for youth during summer. Pililla is also a destination for road cyclists because of its asphalted road, specifically in Sitio Bugarin in Barangay Halayhayin.\n\n==History==\nPilang Munti (Pililla\u2019s pre-Hispanic name) was ruled by a leader named Salyan Maginto. His territory encompasses the modern-day jurisdiction of the municipalities of Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Jalajala. It was referenced as \u201c''munti''\u201d in contrast to the nearby and much larger town of [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the province of Laguna.\n\nCavada, a Spanish historian, revealed that in the year 1571, the Spanish forces conquered the towns along Laguna de Bay which they called \u201cRinconada de Moron\u201d and Pilang Munti was among these which surrendered to the superior force of the Spaniards. Pilang Munti was incorporated into the colonial administration of Morong, and thus, the town was called \"Pilang Morong\".\n\nIn 1572, the first Spanish missionary priests arrived at Pilang Morong. Since then, Christianity was spread by the Spanish priests and in 1582, Fr. Juan de Placencia and Fr. Diego de Oropesa established a \u201cvisita\u201d barrio at Pilang Morong. The place was divided by the Spaniards into 5 \u201c''rancherias''\u201d:\n\n* Monte Tan-ay\n* Sitio Tigbi (Lulukong)\n* San Diego\n* Monte Yakat\n* Dolo Rio (Wawa)\n\nIn 1583, Pilang Morong became an independent municipality. \u201dPililla\u201d was given as the official name of the newly formed town. The name \u201cPililla\u201d arose from the diminutive rules in the Castillan language by modifying a name with \u201c''-illa''\u201d or \u201c''-illo''\u201d to indicate a smaller or younger version.\n\nIn 1599, 16 years after the town was given autonomy, the supreme government granted Pililla the authority to construct a church.\n\nIn 1600, the first church of cogon and bamboo was constructed in the Dolo Rio but this was burned and a church made of wood was constructed but this was also burned down with the whole town in 1632. Another church made of wood was built and this suffered the same fate in 1668. Two years later, the construction of the present church began. This was finished in 1673 and the edifice still stands up to the present.\n\nAs an autonomous town, Pililla encompassed several barrios including Tanay and Jalajala. Tanay separated from Pililla and became an independent town in 1606. Jalajala became a barrio of Pililla in 1676 but was separated and made an independent town in 1786. It was reincorporated as a barrio of Pililla in 1816, but 9 years later, it was once again separated from Pililla to become an independent municipality.\n\nOn December 4, 1837, an election of local officials was held in Pililla. The following towns participated in the said election: Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Jalajala and San Diego. The last town was a new town and is presumed to be either the barrio of Quisao, which has San Diego as its patron, or the barrio of Niogan.\n\nIn 1853, Pililla was separated from the province of Laguna to be incorporated into the newly created Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo. In 1857, it was given the new name Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong.\n\nOn March 10, 1861, two principales of San Diego presented to the government a request, on behalf of the residents of San Diego and the sitios of Mavia and Puang, that their territory be separated from Pililla and to create an independent town to be called Perez. Both the gobernadorcillo and the parish priest, as well as the gobernador politico-militar de Morong, favored the petition. However, it was disapproved by the Administracion Civil since the territory did not meet the pre-requisite of having at least 500 tributes, the said territory was having only 298 tributes at that time.\n\nOn July 9, 1885, the government received another petition from Cabeza de Barangay of San Diego requesting that it be made into a kind of self-governing barrio of Pililla, on account of its remoteness. On January 25, 1886, the government agreed to make San Diego into a \u201c''Visita con Teniente Absolute''\u201d, on condition that the barrio constructs the necessary public buildings. Thus, upon the fulfillment of the agreed condition, the government\u2019s approval went into effect on June 18 of that same year.\n\nIn 1896, the Katipuneros of Pililla and San Diego established their military camp at Rambo or Pabalang na Gubat.\n\nThree years later, on August 6, 1898, Pililla was incorporated in the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. During the existence of the Philippine Republic, San Diego became an independent town. On January 5, 1899, a fierce battle ensued between the American forces and the Filipino troops defending Pililla. The town was partially ravaged by fire and local troops had to retreat to the mountain of Tanay.\n\nThe towns of Pililla and San Diego were integrated into the newly created province of Rizal in June 1901. Two years later, the Philippine Commission, in line with its policy of economy and centralization, consolidated the towns of Pililla, San Diego and Jalajala with the seat of government in Pililla.\n\nThe first ''Capitan'' under the American regime was Regino Quitiong who was the ''alcalde'' from 1900 to 1901.\n\nOn September 20, 1907, Jalajala was separated from Pililla and became an independent municipality. Quisao, on the other hand, remained a barrio of Pililla up to the present.\n\nIn 1918, the population of Pililla was 2,776 and Quisao was 814. In 1929, the place called Longos within the jurisdiction of Pililla was cleared by the majority of the tenant population of the town of Jalajala who transferred their homes to this site and whereon they founded a new community, thus avoiding their agrarian conflict with the plantation owner of Jalajala.\n\nOn September 24, 1929, Don Ananias Vicencio, a philanthropist in public documents, donated a tract of land containing approximately 15 hectares to the families of Manuel Roxas, Leoncio Carungay and Quintin Golliden, all of Jalajala, who shall distribute and assign free of charge and to the best interest of the residents, the said lot at Longos, Barrio Quisao, Municipality of Pililla. In 1939, this land was surveyed by Engr. Quintin Gollidon who provided the layout of this new community now called Barrio Malaya.\n\nOn December 13, 1942, the town of Quisao was attacked and pillaged by \"''tulisanes''\".\n\nDuring the liberation of the town on March 18, 1945, nearly 3/4 of all the houses and public buildings were either burned or destroyed by American and Filipino military bombing and shelling. The Japanese forces and Makapili fled to the mountains following the liberation of the town. The PCAU of the US Army reestablished the municipal government of Pililla on April 20, 1945 with the designation of Lucio Aquino, an active guerrilla leader, as the mayor.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Pililla,Rizaljf6506 11.JPG|thumb|right|Pililla Municipal Hall]]\nPililla is politically subdivided into nine [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n* Bagumbayan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Halayhayin\n* Hulo ([[Poblacion]])\n* Imatong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Malaya\n* Niogan\n* Quisao\n* Wawa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Takungan ([[Poblacion]])\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Pililla\n| 1903 = 2859\n| 1918 = 4701\n| 1939 = 5461\n| 1948 = 6067\n| 1960 = 9021\n| 1970 = 15052\n| 1975 = 18985\n| 1980 = 23222\n| 1990 = 32771\n| 1995 = 37081\n| 2000 = 45275\n| 2007 = 58525\n| 2010 = 59527\n| 2015 = 64812\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Pililla, Rizal, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=38&frmIdLgu=843 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Pililla\n | North     = [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]]\n | Northeast = [[Santa Maria, Laguna]]\n | East      = [[Mabitac, Laguna]]\n | Southeast = [[Pakil, Laguna]]\n | South     = [[Jalajala, Rizal|Jalajala]]\n | West      = ''[[Laguna de Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Rizal}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Rizal]]\n[[Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay]]\n", "name_user": "Subwaymuncher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pililla,_Rizal"}

His son Mas\u2019\u00fbd ibn Bursuq\u00ee replaced him in [[List of rulers of Mosul#Seljuk Atabegs|Mosul]], but his reign was short-lived because of the rise of the [[Zengid dynasty]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |year=2000 |title=The Creation of the Principality of Antioch, 1098\u20131130 |publisher=The Boydell Press |isbn=978-0-85115-661-3 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/creationofprinci00thom }}\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |first=Malcolm |year=2012 |title=The Crusader States |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-11312-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Maalouf |first=Amin |author-link=Amin Maalouf |year=1984 |title=[[The Crusades Through Arab Eyes]] |publisher=SAQI |isbn=978-0-86356-023-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Murray |first=Alan V. |year=2000 |title=The Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A Dynastic History, 1099\u20131125 |publisher=Prosopographica et Geneologica |isbn=978-1-9009-3403-9 |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n[[Category:Atabegs]]\n[[Category:History of Mosul]]\n", "name_user": "Mugsalot", "label": "safe", "comment": "addedCategory:1126 deathsusingHotCat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqsunqur_al-Bursuqi"}
