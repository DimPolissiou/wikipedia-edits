Its members are commonly known as '''birthwort''', '''pipevine''' or '''Dutchman's pipe''' and are widespread and occur in the most diverse climates. Some species, like ''[[Aristolochia utriformis|A.&nbsp;utriformis]]'' and ''[[Aristolochia westlandii|A.&nbsp;westlandii]]'', are threatened with [[extinct]]ion.\n\n''Isotrema'' is usually included here, but might be a valid genus. If so, it contains those species with a three-lobed [[sepal|calyx]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Starr 010420-0105 Aristolochia littoralis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Calico flower (''[[Aristolochia littoralis|A.&nbsp;littoralis]]''): [[Morphology (biology)|habit]]]]\n''Aristolochia'' is a genus of evergreen and deciduous [[liana]]s (woody vines) and herbaceous [[perennial plant|perennial]]s. The smooth [[Plant stem|stem]] is erect or somewhat twining. The simple [[Leaf|leaves]] are alternate and cordate, membranous, growing on leaf stalks. There are no [[stipule]]s.\n\nThe [[flower]]s grow in the leaf [[axil]]s. They are inflated and [[globose]] at the base, continuing as a long [[perianth]] tube, ending in a tongue-shaped, brightly colored lobe. There is no [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]. The [[sepal|calyx]] is one to three whorled, and three to six toothed. The [[sepal]]s are united (gamosepalous). There are six to 40 [[stamen]]s in one whorl. They are united with the style, forming a [[gynostemium]]. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and is four to six locular.\n\nThese flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism. The plants are aromatic and their strong scent<ref>\"sometimes with a very disagreeable odour\" remarks the Royal Horticultural Society, ''Dictionary of Gardening''.</ref> attracts insects. The inner part of the perianth tube is covered with hairs, acting as a fly-trap. These hairs then wither to release the fly, covered with pollen.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is dehiscent [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] with many endospermic seeds.\n\nThe common names ''Dutchman's pipe'' and ''pipevine'' (e.g. common pipevine, ''[[Aristolochia durior|A.&nbsp;durior]]'') are an allusion to old-fashioned [[meerschaum]] pipes at one time common in the Netherlands and northern Germany. ''Birthwort'' (e.g. European birthwort ''[[Aristolochia clematitis|A.&nbsp;clematitis]]'') refers to these species' flower shape, resembling a [[birth canal]]. \nAristolochia was first described by the 4th c. BC Greek philosopher and botanist Theophrastos in his book [Inquiry of Plants, IX.8.3], and the scientific name ''Aristolochia'' was developed from [[Ancient Greek]] ''aristos'' (''\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'') \"best\" + ''locheia'' (''\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1''), ''childbirth'' or ''childbed'', relating to its known ancient use in childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?575,576 |title=Jepson Manual: ''Aristolochia'' |publisher=Ucjeps.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/tours/medicinal_plants/birthwort.asp |title=Missouri Botanical Garden |publisher=Mobot.org |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> The Roman orator [[Cicero]] records a different tradition, that the plant was named for the otherwise unknown individual with the common Greek name Aristolochos, who had learned from a dream that it was an antidote for snake bites.<ref>Cicero, ''On Divination'' 1.10.16</ref>\n[[Image:Aristolochic acid.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Aristolochic acid]], the main [[toxin]] of pipevines]]\n\n==Herbalism, toxicity and carcinogenicity==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe species ''[[Aristolochia clematitis]]'' was highly regarded as a medicinal plant since the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greeks]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Romans]], and on to until the [[Early Modern]] era; it also plays a role in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Due to its resemblance to the uterus, the [[doctrine of signatures]] held that ''birthwort'' was useful in childbirth. A preparation was given to women upon delivery to expel the [[placenta]], as noted by the herbalist [[Dioscurides]] in the 1st century AD. Despite its presence in ancient medicine, ''Aristolochia'' is known to contain the lethal toxin [[aristolochic acid]].\n\nThe ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'', compiled by Li Shi-Zhen in the latter part of the sixteenth century, was based on the author\u2019s experience and on data obtained from earlier herbals; this Chinese herbal classic describes 1892 \"drugs\" (with 1110 drawings), including many species of ''Aristolochia''.<ref>Grollman, A. P., et al. (2009) Aristolochic acid nephropathy: An environmental and iatrogenic disease. In: Fishbein, J. C. (ed.) ''Advances in Molecular Toxicology'' Vol. 3. Amsterdam: Elsevier. pp 211-22.</ref> For 400 years, the ''Bencao Gangmu'' remained the principal source of information in traditional Chinese medicine and the work was translated into numerous languages, reflecting its influence in countries other than China. In the mid-twentieth century, the ''Bencao Gangmu'' was replaced by modern ''Materia Medica'', the most comprehensive source being ''Zhong Hua Ben Cao'' (''Encyclopedia of Chinese Materia Medica''), published in 1999.<ref>Health Department and National Chinese Medicine Management Office (ed.). ''Zhong Hua Ben Cao'', 3\u2013460\u2013509. Shanghai Science Technology Publication. 1999.</ref> The ''Encyclopedia'' lists 23 species of ''Aristolochia'', though with little mention of toxicity. The Chinese government currently lists the following ''Aristolochia'' herbs: ''A.&nbsp;manshuriensis'' (stems), ''A.&nbsp;fangchi'' (root), ''A.&nbsp;debilis'' (root and fruit), and ''[[aristolochia contorta|A.&nbsp;contorta]]'' (fruit), two of which (''madouling'' and ''qingmuxiang'') appear in the 2005 [[Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine ''Aristolochia'' species are used for certain forms of acute [[arthritis]] and [[edema]].<ref>Bensky, D., et al.

Its members are commonly known as '''birthwort''', '''pipevine''' or '''Dutchman's pipe''' and are widespread and occur in the most diverse climates. Some species, like ''[[Aristolochia utriformis|A.&nbsp;utriformis]]'' and ''[[Aristolochia westlandii|A.&nbsp;westlandii]]'', are threatened with [[extinct]]ion.\n\n''Isotrema'' is usually included here, but might be a valid genus. If so, it contains those species with a three-lobed [[sepal|calyx]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Starr 010420-0105 Aristolochia littoralis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Calico flower (''[[Aristolochia littoralis|A.&nbsp;littoralis]]''): [[Morphology (biology)|habit]]]]\n''Aristolochia'' is a genus of evergreen and deciduous [[liana]]s (woody vines) and herbaceous [[perennial plant|perennial]]s. The smooth [[Plant stem|stem]] is erect or somewhat twining. The simple [[Leaf|leaves]] are alternate and cordate, membranous, growing on leaf stalks. There are no [[stipule]]s.\n\nThe [[flower]]s grow in the leaf [[axil]]s. They are inflated and [[globose]] at the base, continuing as a long [[perianth]] tube, ending in a tongue-shaped, brightly colored lobe. There is no [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]. The [[sepal|calyx]] is one to three whorled, and three to six toothed. The [[sepal]]s are united (gamosepalous). There are six to 40 [[stamen]]s in one whorl. They are united with the style, forming a [[gynostemium]]. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and is four to six locular.\n\nThese flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism. The plants are aromatic and their strong scent<ref>\"sometimes with a very disagreeable odour\" remarks the Royal Horticultural Society, ''Dictionary of Gardening''.</ref> attracts insects. The inner part of the perianth tube is covered with hairs, acting as a fly-trap. These hairs then wither to release the fly, covered with pollen.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is dehiscent [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] with many endospermic seeds.\n\nThe common names ''Dutchman's pipe'' and ''pipevine'' (e.g. common pipevine, ''[[Aristolochia durior|A.&nbsp;durior]]'') are an allusion to old-fashioned [[meerschaum]] pipes at one time common in the Netherlands and northern Germany. ''Birthwort'' (e.g. European birthwort ''[[Aristolochia clematitis|A.&nbsp;clematitis]]'') refers to these species' flower shape, resembling a [[birth canal]]. \nAristolochia was first described by the 4th c. BC Greek philosopher and botanist Theophrastos in his book [Inquiry of Plants, IX.8.3], and the scientific name ''Aristolochia'' was developed from [[Ancient Greek]] ''aristos'' (''\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'') \"best\" + ''locheia'' (''\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1''), ''childbirth'' or ''childbed'', relating to its known ancient use in childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?575,576 |title=Jepson Manual: ''Aristolochia'' |publisher=Ucjeps.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/tours/medicinal_plants/birthwort.asp |title=Missouri Botanical Garden |publisher=Mobot.org |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> The Roman orator [[Cicero]] records a different tradition, that the plant was named for the otherwise unknown individual with the common Greek name Aristolochos, who had learned from a dream that it was an antidote for snake bites.<ref>Cicero, ''On Divination'' 1.10.16</ref>\n[[Image:Aristolochic acid.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Aristolochic acid]], the main [[toxin]] of pipevines]]\n\n==Herbalism, toxicity and carcinogenicity==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe species ''[[Aristolochia clematitis]]'' was highly regarded as a medicinal plant since the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greeks]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Romans]], and on to until the [[Early Modern]] era; it also plays a role in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Due to its resemblance to the uterus, the [[doctrine of signatures]] held that ''birthwort'' was useful in childbirth. A preparation was given to women upon delivery to expel the [[placenta]], as noted by the herbalist [[Dioscurides]] in the 1st century AD. Despite its presence in ancient medicine, ''Aristolochia'' is known to contain the lethal toxin [[aristolochic acid]].\n\nThe ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'', compiled by Li Shi-Zhen in the latter part of the sixteenth century, was based on the author\u2019s experience and on data obtained from earlier herbals; this Chinese herbal classic describes 1892 \"drugs\" (with 1110 drawings), including many species of ''Aristolochia''.<ref>Grollman, A.

Amsterdam: Elsevier. pp 211-22.</ref> For 400 years, the ''Bencao Gangmu'' remained the principal source of information in traditional Chinese medicine and the work was translated into numerous languages, reflecting its influence in countries other than China. In the mid-twentieth century, the ''Bencao Gangmu'' was replaced by modern ''Materia Medica'', the most comprehensive source being ''Zhong Hua Ben Cao'' (''Encyclopedia of Chinese Materia Medica''), published in 1999.<ref>Health Department and National Chinese Medicine Management Office (ed.). ''Zhong Hua Ben Cao'', 3\u2013460\u2013509. Shanghai Science Technology Publication. 1999.</ref> The ''Encyclopedia'' lists 23 species of ''Aristolochia'', though with little mention of toxicity. The Chinese government currently lists the following ''Aristolochia'' herbs: ''A.&nbsp;manshuriensis'' (stems), ''A.&nbsp;fangchi'' (root), ''A.&nbsp;debilis'' (root and fruit), and ''[[aristolochia contorta|A.&nbsp;contorta]]'' (fruit), two of which (''madouling'' and ''qingmuxiang'') appear in the 2005 [[Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine ''Aristolochia'' species are used for certain forms of acute [[arthritis]] and [[edema]].<ref>Bensky, D., et al.

While adducts on the transcribed DNA strand within genes are detected and removed by [[Nucleotide excision repair#Transcription coupled repair .28TC-NER.29|transcription-coupled repair]], the adducts on the non-transcribed strand remain and eventually cause DNA replication errors. These adducts have a preference for [[adenine]] bases, and cause A-to-T [[transversion]]s. Furthermore, these metabolites appear to show a preference for C'''A'''G and T'''A'''G sequences.\n\n==Garden history==\nDue to their spectacular flowers, several species are used as [[ornamental plant]]s, notably the hardy ''A.&nbsp;durior'' of eastern North America, which was one of [[John Bartram]]'s many introductions to British gardens; in 1761 Bartram sent seeds he had collected in the [[Ohio River Valley]] to [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]] in London, and Collinson gave them to the nurseryman James Gordon at Mile End to raise. The vine was soon adopted for creating for arbors \"a canopy impenetrable to the rays of the sun, or moderate rain,\" as [[John Sims (taxonomist)|Dr John Sims]] noted in ''[[The Botanical Magazine]]'', 1801.<ref>Quoted in Coats (1964) 1992.</ref>\n[[Image:Black and yellow butterfly KL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trogonoptera brookiana|Rajah Brooke's birdwing]]: its caterpillars feed on ''Aristolochia foveolata'']]\n\n==Swallowtail butterflies==\nMany species of ''Aristolochia'' are eaten by the caterpillar larvae of [[swallowtail butterflies]], thus making themselves unpalatable to most [[predator]]s.

The band has released four EPs, five albums, and a silent album on [[Spotify]] titled ''[[Sleepify]]'' \u2013 royalties from which funded Vulfpeck's admission-free tour in 2014. The band's most recent album, ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', was released in December 2019.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe band members attended [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance|University of Michigan]]'s music school.<ref name=\"med-2015\" /> They first came together as a [[rhythm section]] for a performance at the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering#Laboratories and facilities|Duderstadt Center]], a university facility that houses an arts library and other resources. After reading an interview with German producer [[Reinhold Mack]], band founder Jack Stratton conceived of Vulfpeck as an imagined German version of the U.S. session musicians of the 1960s such as [[The Funk Brothers|Funk Brothers]], [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]], and [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section|Muscle Shoals]]. The idea was to channel that era of the live rhythm section.<ref name=\"vp-jamb2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-mliv2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-tapeop\" />\n\nThe band's founding members are Jack Stratton on keyboards, drums and guitar, [[Theo Katzman]] on guitar, drums and vocals, Woody Goss on keyboards, and Joe Dart on bass.<ref name=\"vp-jamb2014\" /> Touring partners and frequent collaborators are [[Antwaun Stanley]], [[Joey Dosik]] and [[Cory Wong]].<ref name=\"vp-msg-jan2019\" /><ref name=\"vp-brooklyn-2016\" /> Other contributing musicians include Charles Jones, Christine Hucal, [[David T. Walker]], [[Bernard Purdie]], [[James Gadson]] and [[Blake Mills]].\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early years and ''Sleepify'' ===\n\nThe band's first release was titled \"Beastly\". It was released in April 2011 as a [[YouTube]] video. The track was noted for its bass performance by ''No Treble'', an online magazine for bass players.<ref name=\"vp-nt-jun2011\" /> The band released its first EP, ''Mit Peck'', in December 2011, and a second EP, ''Vollmilch'', in December 2012. In 2013 three band members backed [[Darren Criss]] on his national tour, and Katzman was the musical director of the tour.<ref name=\"vp-bb-apr4-14\" /><ref name=\"vp-bb2013\" /> In 2013 Joe Dart was ranked as ''No Treble'''s 5th-favorite bassist.<ref name=\"vp-top10-2013\" /> Vulfpeck's first live performance was at the [[Blind Pig (venue)|Blind Pig]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, followed by a performance in New York City at the [[Rockwood Music Hall]] in October 2013.<ref name=\"vp-mliv2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-nt-nov2013\" /> The band released its third EP, ''My First Car'', in August 2013. The EP features [[Antwaun Stanley]] on the band's first vocal track. A review of ''My First Car'' called it less energetic compared to the band's first two EPs but \"still a fitting addition to a unique catalogue of music\".<ref name=\"vp-review2013\" />\n\nIn March 2014 Vulfpeck released ''[[Sleepify]]'', a ten-track silent album on [[Spotify]], in order to raise funds for an admission-free tour. The album generated $20,000 in royalties over a two-month period.<ref name=\"vp-bb-apr4-14\" /><ref name=\"vp-rs-apr25-14\" /> Subsequently Spotify removed the album stating it violated their terms of content.<ref name=\"vp-bb-apr26-14\" /> The band's royalty generation scheme received international press coverage.<ref name=\"vp-guardian-mar2014\" /><ref name=\"albm-spiegel-2014\" /><ref name=\"albm-time-2014\" /> In July the band received the royalties and announced that they would follow through and organize a tour.<ref name=\"vp-bb-July22-14\" />\n\nIn August 2014 the band announced the Sleepify Tour and released its fourth EP, ''Fugue State''.<ref name=\"vp-tour-annc-aug2014\" /> The EP's second track \"1612\" is styled after [[Wardell Quezergue]]'s works and features Antwaun Stanley on vocals.<ref name=\"vp-nt-1612\" /> The song's title was inspired by the entrance code to an [[Airbnb]] Stratton was subletting.<ref name=\"vp-sirius2016\" /> The admission-free Sleepify Tour was scheduled for September 2014.

The band aims for a simple and minimal sound where each instrument contributes and does not dominate. Recordings are done live with real instruments, and very seldom are different takes cut and mixed. Improvisation is a significant part of song development. The compositions are modeled after unconventional song structures of the past, such as \"[[O-o-h Child|Ooh Child]]\" with an A and B section where each section provides a lift, and \"[[If You Want Me to Stay]]\" with a repetitive eight bar progression.<ref name=\"vp-jamb2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-wupr\" /><ref name=\"vp-clinic-2018\" />\n\n== Side projects ==\nIn 2018 the band's label, Vulf Records, released an EP by the Fearless Flyers quartet consisting of drummer [[Nate Smith (musician)|Nate Smith]], bassist Joe Dart, and guitarists [[Cory Wong]] and [[Snarky Puppy|Mark Lettieri]], with contributors [[Sandra Crouch]], [[Blake Mills]] and [[Tedeschi Trucks Band|Elizabeth Lea]].<ref name=\"vp-live-june2018\" /> In 2019 the label released a second six-track record by the quartet, titled ''The Fearless Flyers II'', featuring [[Chris Thile]] and Joey Dosik.<ref name=\"vp-live-april2019\" /> In 2019 a compilation of eight jazz-style rearrangements of Vulfpeck originals was released by band keyboardist Woody Goss, titled ''A Very Vulfy Christmas''.

The band has released four EPs, five albums, and a silent album on [[Spotify]] titled ''[[Sleepify]]'' \u2013 royalties from which funded Vulfpeck's admission-free tour in 2014. The band's most recent album, ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', was released in December 2019.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe band members attended [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance|University of Michigan]]'s music school.<ref name=\"med-2015\" /> They first came together as a [[rhythm section]] for a performance at the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering#Laboratories and facilities|Duderstadt Center]], a university facility that houses an arts library and other resources. After reading an interview with German producer [[Reinhold Mack]], band founder Jack Stratton conceived of Vulfpeck as an imagined German version of the U.S. session musicians of the 1960s such as [[The Funk Brothers|Funk Brothers]], [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]], and [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section|Muscle Shoals]]. The idea was to channel that era of the live rhythm section.<ref name=\"vp-jamb2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-mliv2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-tapeop\" />\n\nThe band's founding members are Jack Stratton on keyboards, drums and guitar, [[Theo Katzman]] on guitar, drums and vocals, Woody Goss on keyboards, and Joe Dart on bass.<ref name=\"vp-jamb2014\" /> Touring partners and frequent collaborators are [[Antwaun Stanley]], [[Joey Dosik]] and [[Cory Wong]].<ref name=\"vp-msg-jan2019\" /><ref name=\"vp-brooklyn-2016\" /> Other contributing musicians include Charles Jones, Christine Hucal, [[David T. Walker]], [[Bernard Purdie]], [[James Gadson]] and [[Blake Mills]].\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early years and ''Sleepify'' ===\n\nThe band's first release was titled \"Beastly\". It was released in April 2011 as a [[YouTube]] video. The track was noted for its bass performance by ''No Treble'', an online magazine for bass players.<ref name=\"vp-nt-jun2011\" /> The band released its first EP, ''Mit Peck'', in December 2011, and a second EP, ''Vollmilch'', in December 2012. In 2013 three band members backed [[Darren Criss]] on his national tour, and Katzman was the musical director of the tour.<ref name=\"vp-bb-apr4-14\" /><ref name=\"vp-bb2013\" /> In 2013 Joe Dart was ranked as ''No Treble'''s 5th-favorite bassist.<ref name=\"vp-top10-2013\" /> Vulfpeck's first live performance was at the [[Blind Pig (venue)|Blind Pig]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, followed by a performance in New York City at the [[Rockwood Music Hall]] in October 2013.<ref name=\"vp-mliv2014\" /><ref name=\"vp-nt-nov2013\" /> The band released its third EP, ''My First Car'', in August 2013.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli).
