The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'' \u2013 based on a memoir co-authored by Lovell titled ''[[Lost Moon]]'' \u2013 and an episode of the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'' \u2013 based on a memoir co-authored by Lovell titled ''[[Lost Moon]]'' \u2013 and an episode of the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] challenged his nation to land an astronaut on [[the Moon]] by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth.<ref name = \"mission overview\" /> [[NASA]] worked towards this goal incrementally, sending astronauts into space during [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]], leading up to the [[Apollo program]].{{sfn|Hacker & Grimwood|2010|p=382}} The goal was achieved with [[Apollo 11]], which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969.

Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}\n\nThe astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103\u2013104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense.

This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}\n\nThe plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the \"[[Vomit Comet]]\" in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits.

We've had a Main&nbsp;B Bus undervolt.\"<ref name = \"journal Houston\" />\n\nLovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three [[fuel cells]] (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two electric power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage.

These would be needed for the final hours of the mission, but the remaining fuel cell, already starved for oxygen, was drawing from the surge tank. Kranz ordered the surge tank isolated, saving its oxygen, but this meant that the remaining fuel cell would die within two hours, as the oxygen in tank{{nbsp}}1 was consumed or leaked away.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293\u2013294}} The volume surrounding the spacecraft was filled with myriad small bits of debris from the accident, complicating any efforts to use the stars for navigation.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=299}}  The mission's goal became simply getting the astronauts back to Earth alive.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" />\n\n=== Looping around the Moon ===\n[[File:Direct Abort Trajectory - Lunar Landing Symposium, MSC Jun66.jpg|left|upright=1.2|thumb|This depiction of a direct abort (from a 1966 planning report) contemplates returning from a point much earlier in the mission, and closer to Earth, than where the Apollo&nbsp;13 accident occurred.]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo13-ViewsOfMoon-20200224.webm|thumb|left|260px|NASA - Apollo 13 Lunar Mission - Views Of The Moon (2:24)]]\nThe lunar module had charged batteries and full oxygen tanks for use on the lunar surface, so Kranz directed that the astronauts power up the LM and use it as a \"lifeboat\"<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />{{snd}}a scenario anticipated but considered unlikely.{{sfn|Lovell & Kluger|2000|pp=83\u201387}} Procedures for using the LM in this way had been developed by LM flight controllers after a training simulation for Apollo 10 in which the LM was needed for survival, but could not be powered up in time.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" /> Had Apollo&nbsp;13's  accident occurred on the return voyage, with the LM already jettisoned, the astronauts would have died,<ref name=\"LM-ALSEP\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1970-029C|title=Apollo 13 Lunar Module/ALSEP|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> as they would have following an explosion in lunar orbit, including one while Lovell and Haise walked on the Moon.<ref name = \"Yahoo 50th\" />\n\nA key decision was the choice of return path. A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied.

This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only.

The resultant book, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo&nbsp;13]]'', was published in 1994.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39589313/the_postcrescent_11_december_1994/|title=Lovell Describes the Dark Side of Moon Shots|newspaper=The Post-Crescent|location=Appleton, Wisconsin|agency=Associated Press|last1=Dunn|first1=Marcia|date=December 11, 1994|page=F-8|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nThe next year, in 1995, a film adaptation of the book, ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'', was released, directed by [[Ron Howard]] and starring [[Tom Hanks]] as Lovell, [[Bill Paxton]] as Haise, [[Kevin Bacon]] as Swigert, [[Gary Sinise]] as Mattingly, [[Ed Harris]] as Kranz, and [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Marilyn Lovell. James Lovell, Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, given that some [[dramatic license]] was taken. For example, the film changes the tense of Lovell's famous follow-up to Swigert's original words from, \"Houston, we've had a problem\" to \"[[Houston, we have a problem]]\".<ref name = \"journal Houston\" /><ref name = \"nasaMembers\" /> The film also invented the phrase \"[[Failure Is Not an Option|Failure is not an option]]\", uttered by Harris as Kranz in the film; the phrase became so closely associated with Kranz that he used it for the title of his 2000 autobiography.<ref name=\"nasaMembers\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/members-of-apollo-13-team-reflect-on-nasas-finest-hour|title=Members of Apollo 13 Team Reflect on 'NASA's Finest Hour'|last=Granath|first=Bob|date=April 17, 2015|website=NASA|access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref> The film won two of the nine Academy Awards it was nominated for, Best Film Editing and Best Sound.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35088898/the_heraldpalladium/|title=The Winners|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Herald-Palladium|location=Saint Joseph, Michigan|date=March 26, 1996|page=4B|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35088927/st_louis_postdispatch/|title='Braveheart', 'Apollo 13' Lead Oscar Nominees|newspaper=St. Louis Post Dispatch|location=St. Louis, Missouri|date=February 14, 1996|page=4A|via=Newspapers.com|last1=Barnes|first1=Harper}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', co-produced by Hanks and Howard, the mission is dramatized in the episode \"We Interrupt This Program\".

Episodes began airing for Season 2, starting on March 8, 2020, with episode 1, \"Time bomb: Apollo 13\", explaining the launch and the explosion. Episode 2 details the denial and disbelief of Mission Control to the accident, with other episodes covering other aspects of the mission. The seventh and final episode was delayed due to the [[coronavirus pandemic]]. In \"Delay to Episode 7\", the BBC explained that the presenter of the series, medical doctor Kevin Fong, had been called into service.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2/episodes/downloads 13 minutes to the moon, season 2, BBC podcast] accessed April 14, 2020</ref><ref>[http://www.bbcworldservice.com/13_minutes_BBC 13 Minutes to the moon] accessed April 13, 2020.</ref> \n\nIn advance of the 50th anniversary of the mission in 2020, an [[Apollo in Real Time]] site for the mission went online, allowing viewers to follow along as the mission unfolds, view photographs and video, and listen to the conversations, not only between Houston and the astronauts, but between mission controllers on the audio loops.<ref>{{cite web|title=Relive the drama of Apollo 13 in real time, as it happened|date=April 8, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020|last=Reichhardt|first=Tony|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/relive-drama-apollo-13-real-time-it-happened-180974625/|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|journal=Air and Space Magazine}</ref> Due to the pandemic, NASA did not hold any in-person events during April 2020 for the flight's 50th anniversary, but premiered a new documentary, \"Apollo 13: Home Safe\" on April 10, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrate Apollo 13 at 50 with NASA's 'Home Safe' documentary (and much more!)|last=Howell|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.space.com/apollo-13-50th-anniversary-webcast-digital-celebrations.html|date=April 10, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020|publisher=space.com}}</ref> A number of events were rescheduled for later in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Houston, we've had a delay: Apollo 13 50th celebrations rescheduled|last=Pearlman|first=Robert Z.|url=https://www.space.com/apollo13-50th-celebrations-rescheduled.html|date=April 9, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020|publisher=space.com}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:ALSEP Ap13-70-HC-77.jpg|Lovell practices deploying the [[ALSEP]] during training\nFile:Apollo 13 Saturn V during rollout.jpg|The Apollo 13 launch vehicle being rolled out, December 1969\nFile:Apollo 13 Mailbox at Mission Control.jpg|The \"mailbox\" at [[Mission Control#NASA Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] during the Apollo&nbsp;13 mission\nFile:Apollo 13 LM undocking (AS13-59-8566) (cropped).jpg|Lunar module ''Aquarius'' after it was jettisoned above the Earth\nFile:Mission Control Celebrates - GPN-2000-001313.jpg|Mission Control celebrates the successful splashdown\nFile:Apollo 13 Astronauts on the U.S.S.

In 2012 it consisted of 793 officers and 29 support staff.<ref>http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/territorial_support_group_report.pdf IPCC, 21 December 2012 Metropolitan Police Service Territorial Support Group: A review of complaints data and IPCC cases 2008-2012</ref> It specialises in [[public order]] containment, among other specialist policing.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/co/territorial_support.htm|title=Metropolitan Police: Territorial Support Group|date=2008-10-29|publisher=Metropolitan Police Force|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref> The TSG is a uniformed unit of the MPS that replaced the similarly controversial [[Special Patrol Group]] in 1987.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/> TSG units patrol the streets of London in marked [[police van]]s or \"carriers\"; using the call sign \"Uniform\". Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive \"U\" in their [[collar number|shoulder numbers]].\n\n==Role==\n\nToday the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the [[Metropolitan Police District]]:<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n* Securing the capital against [[terrorism]].\n* Responding to [[public order|disorder]] anywhere within London.\n* Reducing priority crime through [[London borough|borough]] support.\n\n===Public order===\nAlthough public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most [[Police Support Unit]] vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with [[acrylic glass]] [[riot shield]]s, visored [[Riotsquad helmet|'NATO' helmets]], shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including [[riot]]s, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the [[Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre|MPS Specialist Training Centre]] in [[Gravesend, Kent]], though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain [[military]] units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat.<ref name=\"waldren\">{{Cite book|title= Armed Police, The Police Use of Firearms since 1945 |last=Waldren |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Sutton |location= England |isbn= 0-7509-4637-7 |page= 224}}</ref> Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was [[Gold-silver-bronze command structure#Silver|tactical]] commander for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]].<ref name=\"MPA0915\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/mpa/2011/0915/05/| title=Acting Commissioner\u2019s Report| accessdate=13 March 2012| last= | first= |date=15 September 2011 |work=MPA Committee Reports | publisher=MPA }}</ref>\n\n===Borough support===\nTSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. [[London borough|Borough]]s are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n===Terrorism response===\nTSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police [[Counter Terrorism Command]]) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Recruitment==\n\nPotential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]]) whilst on division.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:TSG Van123.jpg|thumb|right|TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier)]]\n[[Mercedes Sprinter]]s are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Constable]]s and a [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]]. Three of these vans can form an operational Serial ready to respond to incidents; following the national [[Police Support Unit|PSU]] model this would include an Inspector, three Sergeants, eighteen Constables, two medics and three drivers.<ref name=\"waldren\"/><ref name=\"HMICdyfedPO\">{{Cite web| url=http://inspectorates.homeoffice.gov.uk/hmic/inspections/bvr/dyfedpowys/mar03/dppublicorder.pdf?view=Binary| title=Dyfed-Powys Police - Public Order| accessdate=1 March 2003| last= | first=|date=March 2003 | work=Best Value Review Inspection Reports | publisher=HMIC }}</ref>\n\nTSG officers are not routinely armed, but are equipped with [[Hiatts Speedcuffs|Speedcuffs]], Monadnock fixed [[Club (law enforcement)|batons]] and [[CS gas|CS]]/[[Nonivamide|PAVA]] [[Lachrymatory agent|Incapacitant Spray]] like divisional officers.

He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. [[Peter Waddington]] counters this conclusion in the [[British Journal of Criminology]] by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that [[paramedic]]s in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued.\n\nWaddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three [[Poll Tax Riots]] to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes.<ref name=\"BJC\">{{Cite journal|last=Waddington|first=P.

Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive \"U\" in their [[collar number|shoulder numbers]].\n\n==Role==\n\nToday the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the [[Metropolitan Police District]]:<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n* Securing the capital against [[terrorism]].\n* Responding to [[public order|disorder]] anywhere within London.\n* Reducing priority crime through [[London borough|borough]] support.\n\n===Public order===\nAlthough public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most [[Police Support Unit]] vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with [[acrylic glass]] [[riot shield]]s, visored [[Riotsquad helmet|'NATO' helmets]], shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including [[riot]]s, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the [[Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre|MPS Specialist Training Centre]] in [[Gravesend, Kent]], though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain [[military]] units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat.<ref name=\"waldren\">{{Cite book|title= Armed Police, The Police Use of Firearms since 1945 |last=Waldren |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Sutton |location= England |isbn= 0-7509-4637-7 |page= 224}}</ref> Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was [[Gold-silver-bronze command structure#Silver|tactical]] commander for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]].<ref name=\"MPA0915\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/mpa/2011/0915/05/| title=Acting Commissioner\u2019s Report| accessdate=13 March 2012| last= | first= |date=15 September 2011 |work=MPA Committee Reports | publisher=MPA }}</ref>\n\n===Borough support===\nTSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. [[London borough|Borough]]s are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n===Terrorism response===\nTSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police [[Counter Terrorism Command]]) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Recruitment==\n\nPotential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]]) whilst on division.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:TSG Van123.jpg|thumb|right|TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier)]]\n[[Mercedes Sprinter]]s are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Constable]]s and a [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]].

He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. [[Peter Waddington]] counters this conclusion in the [[British Journal of Criminology]] by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that [[paramedic]]s in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued.\n\nWaddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three [[Poll Tax Riots]] to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes.<ref name=\"BJC\">{{Cite journal|last=Waddington|first=P.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek encountered [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), now a Polish army officer, who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]], where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99\u2013107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108\u2013118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nIn June 1941, [[Peter Wilkinson (diplomat)|Peter Wilkinson]] of SOE came to Cairo and officially dismissed Skarbek and Kowerski, although keeping them on the SOE payroll with a  small retainer that forced them to live in near poverty.{{sfn|Mulley|2017|pages=124-133}} Kowerski, who was under less suspicion than Skarbek, eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 949.</ref>\n\nWhen Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, was informed that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed out of his own career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> (The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946.) \n\nA week after the dismissal of Skarbek and Kowerski, on 22 June 1941 Germany began its [[Operation Barbarossa]] invasion of the [[Soviet Union]],  predicted by the intelligence the couple had passed along to the British from the Musketeers.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 131.</ref> It is now known that advance information about Operation Barbarossa had also been provided by a number of other sources, including [[Ultra]].<ref>Read, Anthony, and David Fisher, ''[[Lucy spy ring|Operation Lucy]]: Most Secret Spy Ring of the Second World War'', New York, Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1981; {{ISBN|0-698-11079-X}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the remainder of 1941, 1942, and 1943, Skarbek was given several small tasks by SOE, such as intelligence gathering in Syria and Cairo, including passing along information to the British on Polish intelligence and resistance agencies. She turned down offers of office work and continued to be sidelined from the kind of dangerous and difficult work she desired.{{sfn|Mulley|2017|pages=134-148}} Both she and Kowerski continued to be under suspicion by the British and resented by the Polish government-in-exile because they worked for Britain.{{sfn|Walker|2014|page=82}}\n\n===Training===\nSkarbek's route back to active service with SOE began with her joining the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), an all-woman charity organization with military-style uniforms, that was used as a cover for many women in the SOE. The SOE officer who recruited her, Patrick Howarth, would later say jokingly that \"the most useful thing I did in World War II was to reinstate Christine Granville.\" Her briefing officer in FANY, Gwendolin Lees, was so impressed by Skarbek (now more commonly known as Granville) that she later named a daughter after her.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=148-149}} Despite Skarbek's experience in clandestine work, she was given SOE training for prospective agents. She proved to be a less than apt student at wireless transmitting (at which she was hopeless) and firearms (which she hated), but she loved parachuting.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=150-151, 168-176}}\n\nSOE's original plan to parachute Skarbek into Hungary was cancelled because the mission was deemed \"little short of homicide.\" The continued suspicions about her by the Polish government-in-exile precluded a return to Poland. Thus, SOE decided to infiltrate her into southern France. Her French was good and she took a course to improve her English. She moved to Algeria in preparation for a mission to France, but she was not immediately dispatched because SOE believed she was \"too flamboyant to work undercover effectively.\"{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=171-172}}\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] in August 1944.

The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to  F Section in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]], where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99\u2013107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108\u2013118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M.

Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 949.</ref>\n\nWhen Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, was informed that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed out of his own career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> (The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946.) \n\nA week after the dismissal of Skarbek and Kowerski, on 22 June 1941 Germany began its [[Operation Barbarossa]] invasion of the [[Soviet Union]],  predicted by the intelligence the couple had passed along to the British from the Musketeers.<ref>M.

She turned down offers of office work and continued to be sidelined from the kind of dangerous and difficult work she desired.{{sfn|Mulley|2017|pages=134-148}} Both she and Kowerski continued to be under suspicion by the British and resented by the Polish government-in-exile because they worked for Britain.{{sfn|Walker|2014|page=82}}\n\n===Training===\nSkarbek's route back to active service with SOE began with her joining the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), an all-woman charity organization with military-style uniforms, that was used as a cover for many women in the SOE. The SOE officer who recruited her, Patrick Howarth, would later say jokingly that \"the most useful thing I did in World War II was to reinstate Christine Granville.\" Her briefing officer in FANY, Gwendolin Lees, was so impressed by Skarbek (now more commonly known as Granville) that she later named a daughter after her.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=148-149}} Despite Skarbek's experience in clandestine work, she was given SOE training for prospective agents. She proved to be a less than apt student at wireless transmitting (at which she was hopeless) and firearms (which she hated), but she loved parachuting.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=150-151, 168-176}}\n\nSOE's original plan to parachute Skarbek into Hungary was cancelled because the mission was deemed \"little short of homicide.\" The continued suspicions about her by the Polish government-in-exile precluded a return to Poland. Thus, SOE decided to infiltrate her into southern France. Her French was good and she took a course to improve her English. She moved to Algeria in preparation for a mission to France, but she was not immediately dispatched because SOE believed she was \"too flamboyant to work undercover effectively.\"{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=171-172}}\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] in August 1944.

New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to  F Section in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.
