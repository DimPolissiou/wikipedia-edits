members to Senedd Cymru (the [[Welsh Parliament]]). It would be the sixth [[general election]] since the (formerly named) Assembly was established in 1999. The election will be held along with the other [[2021 United Kingdom local elections]].\n\nIt will be the first election in which 16 and 17 year olds are allowed to vote in Wales, the largest extension of the franchise in Wales since 1969. Both changes were a result of the [[Senedd and Elections (Wales) Bill 2019]].<ref name=\":assemblywales2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.assembly.wales/en/newhome/pages/newsitem.aspx?itemid=2054|title=16 and 17 year olds get right to vote - a historic day for democracy in Wales|website=National Assembly for Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSeven parties had AMs in the fifth Assembly: [[Welsh Labour]] led by [[First Minister of Wales|First Minister]] [[Mark Drakeford]], [[Welsh Conservative Party|Welsh Conservatives]] led by [[Paul Davies (politician)|Paul Davies]], [[Plaid Cymru]] led by [[Adam Price]], the [[Brexit Party]] led by [[Mark Reckless]], [[UK Independence Party|UKIP Wales]] led by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]], the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] led by [[Jane Dodds]] and the Welsh National Party led by [[Neil McEvoy]].\n\n==Electoral system==\n{{main|Mixed-Member Proportional}}\n{{main|Additional Member System}}\nIn [[election]]s for the Welsh Parliament, each voter has two votes in the [[additional member system]]. The first vote is for a candidate to become the Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote is for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[D'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation. The overall result is approximately [[proportional representation|proportional]].\n\nIn accordance to the [[Wales Act 2014]], a candidate is allowed to stand in both a constituency, as well as a regional list. However, holding a [[dual mandate]] with the House of Commons is illegal, meaning a Welsh Parliament Member cannot also be an MP.\n\nThis will be the first election where 16 and 17 year olds can vote, following the introduction of a new law in January 2020.<ref>https://www.assembly.wales/en/newhome/pages/newsitem.aspx?itemid=2065</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom]] was the last of its kind.

[[Welsh Labour]] suffered an 8% drop in their vote and they were completely wiped out of [[North Wales]], apart from in [[Alyn and Deeside (UK Parliament constituency)|Alyn and Deeside]]. Labour ended up losing 6 parliamentary seats to the [[Welsh Conservatives]] in [[Boris Johnson|Boris Johnson's]] [[landslide victory]]. These seats included [[Bridgend (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgend]], which has been represented on the [[Bridgend (Assembly constituency)|assembly level]] by former [[First Minister of Wales]] [[Carwyn Jones]] since [[1999 National Assembly for Wales election|1999]].

Together with Teegarden c, GJ 1061 c, d, GJ 273 b and Tau ceti e, it is the fourth-closest potentially habitable exoplanet as of April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.midilibre.fr/2020/01/07/toi-700d-une-planete-de-la-taille-de-la-terre-decouverte-dans-une-zone-habitable,8645004.php|title=[VIDEO] TOI 700d : une plan\u00e8te de la taille de la Terre d\u00e9couverte dans une \"zone habitable\"|website=midilibre.fr|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Discovery ==\nTeegarden b was discovered in June 2019. The alignment and dimness of Teegarden didn't allow for the transit method to be of much use, so astronomers instead used the CARMENES next-generation telescope. Located at Spain's Calar Alto Observatory, the instrument allowed the researchers to look for small changes in the star's velocity. After three years of close observation, watching for any wobbles produced by potential orbiting objects, more than 200 measurements indicate the existence of two new planets, known as Teegarden b and [[Teegarden c]].<ref name=\"sciencealert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/two-earth-like-planets-found-orbiting-a-star-just-12-light-years-away |title=We Just Found 2 of The Most Earth-Like Exoplanets Yet, Only 12.5 Light Years Away |last=Cassella |first=Carly |date=June 19, 2019 |website=Science Alert }}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nTeegarden b is the innermost known planet orbiting Teegarden's Star, with an orbital period of just 4.91 days. The minimum mass of the planet is about 1 Earth mass, and because of this is likely to be rocky. Teegarden b may even have an ocean of water on its surface.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" />\n\n== Habitability ==\n{{Puffery|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Artist&#039;s impression of the planet Ross 128 b.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ross 128]], an example of quiet red dwarf that can support habitable planet, like [[Teegarden's Star]].]]\n[[File:Kepler-438 b superflare.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kepler-438]], an example for active red dwarf with powerful flares that can strip the atmosphere of planet, making it uninhabitable.]]\nTeegarden b orbits within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star. It has a 60 percent chance of having a habitable surface temperature, between 0\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C, though probably closer to 28\u00b0C.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" /> \n\nAnother factor for Teegarden b's potential habitability is its host star. Most red dwarfs emit powerful flares, which can strip the atmospheres off their planets and cause them to be uninhabitable. A good example is [[Kepler-438b]], which has an ESI score of 0.88, but because of its active star it is likely uninhabitable, and another example is [[Proxima Centauri]], the closest star to us. However, Teegarden's Star is relatively inactive and quiet, increasing the chance that Teegarden b may be habitable. Other quiet red dwarfs with potentially habitable exoplanets are [[Ross 128]] and [[Luyten's Star]].\n\n== Host star ==\nTeegarden\u2019s star is a low-mass red dwarf, with a mass of around 9 percent the mass of the Sun's, and with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623\u00b0C or 4,760 F). The very low temperature and luminosity of Teegarden's Star explains why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is also older than the [[Sun]], with age of 8 billion years.\n\nIt was discovered in 2003. Astronomers had long thought it was likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars existed within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected, and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden's team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. So they reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then located on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery.\n\nThe parallax was initially measured as 0.43 \u00b1 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making [[Teegarden's Star]] only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between [[Barnard's Star]] and [[Wolf 359]]. However, even at that time the anomalously low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the [[Sun]]'s nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding the now accepted distance of 12.578 light-years.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/07/aa35460-19/aa35460-19.html The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: Two temperate Earth-mass planet candidates around Teegarden\u2019s Star]\n\n[[Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2019]]\n[[Category:Aries (constellation)]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{short description|Exoplanet}}\n{{Infobox planet\n| name                     = Teegarden b\n| website                  = Teegardenb.com\n| https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/art_red_dwarf_planets.jpg                = \n<!-- IMAGE               -->\n| image = [[File:Teegarden&#039;s star proper motion.gif|300 px]]\n| caption = Teegarden's Star proper motion\n<!-- DISCOVERY           -->\n| discoverer               = \n| discovery_site           = [[Calar Alto Observatory]]\n| discovered               = June 2019\n| discovery_method         = [[Doppler spectroscopy]]\n<!-- DESIGNATIONS        -->\n<!-- ORBITAL             --> \n| apsis                    = \n| semimajor                = {{val|0.0252|0.0008|0.0009}} [[astronomical unit|AU]]\n| eccentricity             = {{val|0|+0.16|0}}\n| period                   = {{val|4.91|0.0014}} days\n<!-- PHYS CHARS          --> \n| mean_radius  \n| single_temperature       = {{convert|301|K|C}}\n<!-- ATMOSPHERE          --> \n<!-- NOTES               --> \n}}\n'''Teegarden b''' is an [[exoplanet]] found orbiting within the habitable zone of [[Teegarden's star]], an M-type [[red dwarf]] star around 12 light years away from the [[Solar system|Solar System]].

After three years of close observation, watching for any wobbles produced by potential orbiting objects, more than 200 measurements indicate the existence of two new planets, known as Teegarden b and [[Teegarden c]].<ref name=\"sciencealert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/two-earth-like-planets-found-orbiting-a-star-just-12-light-years-away |title=We Just Found 2 of The Most Earth-Like Exoplanets Yet, Only 12.5 Light Years Away |last=Cassella |first=Carly |date=June 19, 2019 |website=Science Alert }}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nTeegarden b is the innermost known planet orbiting Teegarden's Star, with an orbital period of just 4.91 days. The minimum mass of the planet is about 1 Earth mass, and because of this is likely to be rocky. Teegarden b may even have an ocean of water on its surface.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" />\n\n== Habitability ==\n{{Puffery|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Artist&#039;s impression of the planet Ross 128 b.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ross 128]], an example of quiet red dwarf that can support habitable planet, like [[Teegarden's Star]].]]\n[[File:Kepler-438 b superflare.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kepler-438]], an example for active red dwarf with powerful flares that can strip the atmosphere of planet, making it uninhabitable.]]\nTeegarden b orbits within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star. It has a 60 percent chance of having a habitable surface temperature, between 0\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C, though probably closer to 28\u00b0C.<ref name=\"sciencealert\" /> \n\nAnother factor for Teegarden b's potential habitability is its host star. Most red dwarfs emit powerful flares, which can strip the atmospheres off their planets and cause them to be uninhabitable. A good example is [[Kepler-438b]], which has an ESI score of 0.88, but because of its active star it is likely uninhabitable, and another example is [[Proxima Centauri]], the closest star to us. However, Teegarden's Star is relatively inactive and quiet, increasing the chance that Teegarden b may be habitable. Other quiet red dwarfs with potentially habitable exoplanets are [[Ross 128]] and [[Luyten's Star]].\n\n== Host star ==\nTeegarden\u2019s star is a low-mass red dwarf, with a mass of around 9 percent the mass of the Sun's, and with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623\u00b0C or 4,760 F). The very low temperature and luminosity of Teegarden's Star explains why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is also older than the [[Sun]], with age of 8 billion years.\n\nIt was discovered in 2003. Astronomers had long thought it was likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars existed within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected, and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden's team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. So they reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then located on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery.\n\nThe parallax was initially measured as 0.43 \u00b1 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making [[Teegarden's Star]] only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between [[Barnard's Star]] and [[Wolf 359]]. However, even at that time the anomalously low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the [[Sun]]'s nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding the now accepted distance of 12.578 light-years.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/07/aa35460-19/aa35460-19.html The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: Two temperate Earth-mass planet candidates around Teegarden\u2019s Star]\n\n[[Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2019]]\n[[Category:Aries (constellation)]]\n", "name_user": "Albertheditor", "label": "safe", "comment": "updated for current month", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teegarden_b"}
