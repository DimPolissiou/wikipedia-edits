As a youth, he had an English governess and grew up in English boarding schools. He also composed, sang, and played [[piano]] and [[timpani]]. While his father noticed his son's musical talents, he nevertheless dissuaded Carlos from pursuing a musical career: \"What a pity the boy is musically talented\", wrote Erich to a friend.<ref name=WPobit />\n\nCarlos first studied [[chemistry]] at [[ETH Zurich]], but soon decided to dedicate himself to music. He was [[r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur]] at the [[Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz|G\u00e4rtnerplatz Theatre]] in [[Munich]] in 1952, and made his conducting debut with the [[operetta]] ''[[Gasparone]]'' at [[Potsdam]] theatre in 1954. From 1958 to 1964 he was ''Kapellmeister'' at the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]], and then at the Opera in Zurich from 1964 to 1966. Between 1966 and 1973 he was first ''Kapellmeister'' in [[Stuttgart]], his last permanent post. During the following years, he often conducted at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] in Munich.\n\n== Mature career ==\nDuring his freelance career, Kleiber restricted his conducting appearances to a select number of occasions. He made his British debut in 1966 with a performance at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] of [[Alban Berg]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Wozzeck]]'', a work whose premiere his father had conducted in 1925.  Kleiber's repertoire at the [[Royal Opera House]] included ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'' and ''[[Otello]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Performance Database Search Results\n|publisher=Royal Opera House Collections Online|url=http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/SearchResults.aspx?person=Carlos%20Kleiber&searchtype=workprodperf|accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>  He made his [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] debut in 1974 conducting [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.\n\nHis American debut came in 1978 with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]],<ref>{{cite news|author=John Rockwell|authorlink=John Rockwell|title=Carlos Kleiber Is Dead at 74;

they include [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth]] and [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh]] [[symphony|symphonies]] with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]],  [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]] and [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Schubert)|third]] and [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|eighth]] (\"Unfinished\") symphonies, also with the Vienna Philharmonic, recordings of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Concerto for piano and orchestra]] with [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'', [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]' ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La traviata]]''.  His last studio recording was [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' with the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]]. Recording sessions began in 1980 but Kleiber left before they were completed. However, as a musically complete performance had been set down, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] went ahead and released it, much to Kleiber's anger.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nKleiber's small studio discography has been increased by a number of releases of live recordings, often sourced from broadcast relays. These have included his two [[Vienna New Year's Concert]]s, and performances of Beethoven's Fourth, Sixth and Seventh Symphonies with the Bavarian State Orchestra. The Sixth is especially notable as being the only occasion on which Kleiber conducted the work; in this instance the source came not from a radio broadcast but a C-90 [[compact cassette]] recorded for his son.<ref>https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/beethoven-symphony-no-6-0</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nKleiber retired from concert life in the early 1990s, occasionally reappearing for private or [[benefit concert]]s. For one such event in Ingolstadt, part of his payment consisted of a new [[Audi]] made to his specifications. His performances were painstakingly rehearsed, but often seemed spontaneous and inspired. In the opinion of many of his colleagues and audiences, he was an eccentric genius whom some placed among the greatest conductors of all time despite the paucity of his appearances.<ref name=WPobit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63106-2004Jul19.html?noredirect=on|title=Gifted, Eccentric Conductor Carlos Kleiber Dies at 74|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref>\"Kleiber, Carlos\" ''Current Biography Yearbook'', 1991 edition, H.

In his interview, Abbado termed Kleiber \"one of the greatest, if not the greatest, conductors of the 20th century\" (\"Carlos \u00e8 stato uno dei pi\u00f9 grandi, se non il pi\u00f9 grande, direttore del Novecento.\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/radio3_suite/view.cfm?Q_EV_ID=240713&Q_PROG_ID=68 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210845/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/radio3_suite/view.cfm?Q_EV_ID=240713&Q_PROG_ID=68 |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn 26 September 2009, BBC Radio 3 transmitted a documentary, ''Who Was Carlos Kleiber?''.

Producer Jon Tolansky, who himself played for Kleiber at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, interviewed singers [[Ileana Cotruba\u0219]], [[Thomas Hampson]], Dame [[Felicity Lott]], the late Dame [[Margaret Price]] and [[Jonathan Summers]], members of the Chicago Symphony, Royal Opera House, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras, conductor and Kleiber friend Charles Barber, administrators Sir Peter Jonas and Sir John Tooley, and recording executive Costa Pilavachi. This audio essay incorporated numerous excerpts from Kleiber's most important recordings, including Beethoven's fifth and seventh symphonies, Verdi's ''La traviata'', Richard Strauss' ''Der Rosenkavalier'', and Weber's ''Der Freisch\u00fctz''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://correspondingwithcarlos.com/two-hour-radio-special-on-carlos-kleiber-now-available-online-and-free/|title=NOW: Carlos in Korean / Carlos on DGG Documentary|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Honors and posthumous evaluation===\n\nOn 21 June 2010, Ljubljana celebrated Carlos Kleiber's 80th birthday with a concert by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] directed by Kleiber's friend [[Riccardo Muti]]. ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' announced on 17 March 2011 that Kleiber had been selected as \"the greatest conductor of all time.\" Some 100 current conductors, including [[Sir Colin Davis]], [[Gustavo Dudamel]], [[Valery Gergiev]] and [[Mariss Jansons]], participated in the BBC poll. Kleiber, who conducted just 96 concerts and around 400 operatic performances in his 74 years, was voted ahead of [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Claudio Abbado]], who took second and third places respectively.\n\n[[Susanna M\u00e4lkki]], Music director, Ensemble Intercontemporain, and one of the conductors polled, commented: \"Carlos Kleiber brought an incredible energy to music... Yes, he did have about five times as much time to rehearse than conductors do today, but he deserved it because his vision was remarkable, he knew what he wanted, and his attention to detail was truly inspiring.\"\n\nJeremy Pound, Deputy Editor of BBC Music Magazine, added: \"Asking 100 of today's conducting greats to name their idols and inspirations was a fascinating experience. Not least when so many named Carlos Kleiber, who in the course of his whole lifetime conducted fewer concerts than most of them direct in just a couple of years. Kleiber's incredible attention to detail, sheer enthusiasm for music, and astonishingly accomplished level of performance could never be doubted \u2013 perhaps 'less is more' is the real path to true greatness?\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Charles Barber, biographer, friend and pen-pal of Kleiber, another factor contributed to his legendary and unusual career. \"Uniquely, Carlos Kleiber combined the rigors of German analysis, form and discipline with the expressive vitality of Latin dance, pulse and joy. For nearly twenty years at the formative outset, a conductor baptized Karl gradually became Carlos. He never turned his back on that fascinating cultural biochemistry. It would shape everything he did.\"<ref name=Barber />\n\nKleiber was voted into the [[Gramophone Hall of Fame]] in 2012. [[Clemens Hellsberg]] (''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', May 2012) said:\n\n<blockquote>What was it that propelled Carlos Kleiber to near mystical heights? It was the unforgettable experience of surpassing one's own boundaries, yet also the utter helplessness when he stormed off in the last minutes of a final rehearsal. This was not pretension but rather the expression of deepest despair, even though the orchestra had performed at the highest level \u2013 or perhaps for that very reason. Extreme contradictions characterised his personality: one constantly feared catastrophe, yet he was always available to musicians for private conversations. He had a vast repertoire, yet restricted himself to a very few works. His outbursts of rage could be directed at anyone, yet his interaction with children was characterised by a precious and fragile tenderness. In art there are no upward limits. Yet each generation needs at least one artist who exemplifies this. Kleiber reached to the stars for us; even when he broke down in his efforts, he still proved that they exist.</blockquote>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Cultural Honour of the City of Munich (1978)\n* [[Pour le M\u00e9rite for Science and Art]] (Germany, 1990)\n* [[Austrian Medal for Science and Art]] (1992){{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Golden Baton of [[La Scala]] (Milan, 1995)\n* [[Deutscher Schallplattenpreis|German Record Prize]]\n* [[Bavarian Order of Merit]]\n* [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]]\n* Grand Merit Cross with Star of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n\n== Discography ==\nDates refer to the original recorded performance, not necessarily date of commercial release.

As a youth, he had an English governess and grew up in English boarding schools. He also composed, sang, and played [[piano]] and [[timpani]]. While his father noticed his son's musical talents, he nevertheless dissuaded Carlos from pursuing a musical career: \"What a pity the boy is musically talented\", wrote Erich to a friend.<ref name=WPobit />\n\nCarlos first studied [[chemistry]] at [[ETH Zurich]], but soon decided to dedicate himself to music. He was [[r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur]] at the [[Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz|G\u00e4rtnerplatz Theatre]] in [[Munich]] in 1952, and made his conducting debut with the [[operetta]] ''[[Gasparone]]'' at [[Potsdam]] theatre in 1954. From 1958 to 1964 he was ''Kapellmeister'' at the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]], and then at the Opera in Zurich from 1964 to 1966. Between 1966 and 1973 he was first ''Kapellmeister'' in [[Stuttgart]], his last permanent post. During the following years, he often conducted at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] in Munich.\n\n== Mature career ==\nDuring his freelance career, Kleiber restricted his conducting appearances to a select number of occasions. He made his British debut in 1966 with a performance at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] of [[Alban Berg]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Wozzeck]]'', a work whose premiere his father had conducted in 1925.

they include [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth]] and [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh]] [[symphony|symphonies]] with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]],  [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]] and [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Schubert)|third]] and [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|eighth]] (\"Unfinished\") symphonies, also with the Vienna Philharmonic, recordings of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Concerto for piano and orchestra]] with [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'', [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]' ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La traviata]]''.  His last studio recording was [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' with the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]]. Recording sessions began in 1980 but Kleiber left before they were completed. However, as a musically complete performance had been set down, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] went ahead and released it, much to Kleiber's anger.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nKleiber's small studio discography has been increased by a number of releases of live recordings, often sourced from broadcast relays. These have included his two [[Vienna New Year's Concert]]s, and performances of Beethoven's Fourth, Sixth and Seventh Symphonies with the Bavarian State Orchestra. The Sixth is especially notable as being the only occasion on which Kleiber conducted the work; in this instance the source came not from a radio broadcast but a C-90 [[compact cassette]] recorded for his son.<ref>https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/beethoven-symphony-no-6-0</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nKleiber retired from concert life in the early 1990s, occasionally reappearing for private or [[benefit concert]]s. For one such event in Ingolstadt, part of his payment consisted of a new [[Audi]] made to his specifications. His performances were painstakingly rehearsed, but often seemed spontaneous and inspired. In the opinion of many of his colleagues and audiences, he was an eccentric genius whom some placed among the greatest conductors of all time despite the paucity of his appearances.<ref name=WPobit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63106-2004Jul19.html?noredirect=on|title=Gifted, Eccentric Conductor Carlos Kleiber Dies at 74|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref>\"Kleiber, Carlos\" ''Current Biography Yearbook'', 1991 edition, H.

In his interview, Abbado termed Kleiber \"one of the greatest, if not the greatest, conductors of the 20th century\" (\"Carlos \u00e8 stato uno dei pi\u00f9 grandi, se non il pi\u00f9 grande, direttore del Novecento.\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/radio3_suite/view.cfm?Q_EV_ID=240713&Q_PROG_ID=68 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210845/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/radio3_suite/view.cfm?Q_EV_ID=240713&Q_PROG_ID=68 |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn 26 September 2009, BBC Radio 3 transmitted a documentary, ''Who Was Carlos Kleiber?''.

Producer Jon Tolansky, who himself played for Kleiber at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, interviewed singers [[Ileana Cotruba\u0219]], [[Thomas Hampson]], Dame [[Felicity Lott]], the late Dame [[Margaret Price]] and [[Jonathan Summers]], members of the Chicago Symphony, Royal Opera House, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras, conductor and Kleiber friend Charles Barber, administrators Sir Peter Jonas and Sir John Tooley, and recording executive Costa Pilavachi. This audio essay incorporated numerous excerpts from Kleiber's most important recordings, including Beethoven's fifth and seventh symphonies, Verdi's ''La traviata'', Richard Strauss' ''Der Rosenkavalier'', and Weber's ''Der Freisch\u00fctz''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://correspondingwithcarlos.com/two-hour-radio-special-on-carlos-kleiber-now-available-online-and-free/|title=NOW: Carlos in Korean / Carlos on DGG Documentary|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Honors and posthumous evaluation===\n\nOn 21 June 2010, Ljubljana celebrated Carlos Kleiber's 80th birthday with a concert by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] directed by Kleiber's friend [[Riccardo Muti]]. ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' announced on 17 March 2011 that Kleiber had been selected as \"the greatest conductor of all time.\" Some 100 current conductors, including [[Sir Colin Davis]], [[Gustavo Dudamel]], [[Valery Gergiev]] and [[Mariss Jansons]], participated in the BBC poll. Kleiber, who conducted just 96 concerts and around 400 operatic performances in his 74 years, was voted ahead of [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Claudio Abbado]], who took second and third places respectively.\n\n[[Susanna M\u00e4lkki]], Music director, Ensemble Intercontemporain, and one of the conductors polled, commented: \"Carlos Kleiber brought an incredible energy to music... Yes, he did have about five times as much time to rehearse than conductors do today, but he deserved it because his vision was remarkable, he knew what he wanted, and his attention to detail was truly inspiring.\"\n\nJeremy Pound, Deputy Editor of BBC Music Magazine, added: \"Asking 100 of today's conducting greats to name their idols and inspirations was a fascinating experience. Not least when so many named Carlos Kleiber, who in the course of his whole lifetime conducted fewer concerts than most of them direct in just a couple of years. Kleiber's incredible attention to detail, sheer enthusiasm for music, and astonishingly accomplished level of performance could never be doubted \u2013 perhaps 'less is more' is the real path to true greatness?\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Charles Barber, biographer, friend and pen-pal of Kleiber, another factor contributed to his legendary and unusual career. \"Uniquely, Carlos Kleiber combined the rigors of German analysis, form and discipline with the expressive vitality of Latin dance, pulse and joy. For nearly twenty years at the formative outset, a conductor baptized Karl gradually became Carlos. He never turned his back on that fascinating cultural biochemistry. It would shape everything he did.\"<ref name=Barber />\n\nKleiber was voted into the [[Gramophone Hall of Fame]] in 2012. [[Clemens Hellsberg]] (''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', May 2012) said:\n\n<blockquote>What was it that propelled Carlos Kleiber to near mystical heights? It was the unforgettable experience of surpassing one's own boundaries, yet also the utter helplessness when he stormed off in the last minutes of a final rehearsal. This was not pretension but rather the expression of deepest despair, even though the orchestra had performed at the highest level \u2013 or perhaps for that very reason. Extreme contradictions characterised his personality: one constantly feared catastrophe, yet he was always available to musicians for private conversations. He had a vast repertoire, yet restricted himself to a very few works. His outbursts of rage could be directed at anyone, yet his interaction with children was characterised by a precious and fragile tenderness. In art there are no upward limits. Yet each generation needs at least one artist who exemplifies this. Kleiber reached to the stars for us; even when he broke down in his efforts, he still proved that they exist.</blockquote>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Cultural Honour of the City of Munich (1978)\n* [[Pour le M\u00e9rite for Science and Art]] (Germany, 1990)\n* [[Austrian Medal for Science and Art]] (1992){{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Golden Baton of [[La Scala]] (Milan, 1995)\n* [[Deutscher Schallplattenpreis|German Record Prize]]\n* [[Bavarian Order of Merit]]\n* [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]]\n* Grand Merit Cross with Star of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n\n== Discography ==\nDates refer to the original recorded performance, not necessarily date of commercial release.

The earliest reference from within Ireland about bees are in the Bee Judgements of the [[Brehon Laws]] which among other issues dealt with the ownership and value of swarms, the compensation paid by the beekeeper to a person stung by one of his bees and the compensation paid to the beekeeper if a person's hens began eating his bees. The Brehon Laws began to be codified about 438-441 A.D. having been handed down orally from previous generations, they contain no [[Latin]] loan words relating to bees or beekeeping, which provides further evidence that beekeeping vocabulary was established before the arrival of Christianity in about 430 A.D. However legend has it that St. [[Modomnoc]] first brought bees to Ireland from [[Wales]] in the early 540's A.D. just after the effects of the [[extreme weather events of 535\u2013536]] A.D. would have been subsiding. A \"great mortality of bees\" was recorded in 950 A.D., and again in 992 A.D. when it was said that \"Bees were largely kept in Ireland at this time, and were a great source of wealth to the people\". In 1443 A.D \"the third [[epizooty]] of bees\" was recorded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Flemming |first1=George |title=Animal plagues: Their history, nature and prevention |date=1871 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animalplaguesthe00flem/page/53 53], 58, & 118 |url=https://archive.org/details/animalplaguesthe00flem |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first beekeeping book in Ireland was ''Instructions for managing bees'' in 1733, it included recommendations for the use of [[skep]]s and stipulated the best size to use to encourage at least one [[swarming (honey bee)|swarm]] per year with two afterswarms to follow. The bees would traditionally have been killed at the end of each season, often with the use of brimstone matches, to be able to extract the honey and wax. However, by the mid-1700s boxes for keeping bees had begun to be used and methods of extracting the honey and wax, without killing the bees, were being devised.\nIn the 1870s Brother Joeseph, a Carmelite monk from [[Loughrea]], imported a Bar and Frame Hive<ref>{{cite book |last1=W.

In 1881 the Irish Beekeepers Associations (IBKA) was formed, holding a honey show in Dublin; in 1908 their name was changed to Irish Beekeepers' Association (IBA), in 1939 it was wound up due to decreasing membership.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James K. |title=Bee-keeping in Ireland: A history. |date=1981 |publisher=The Glendale Press |isbn=978-0907606000 |pages=vi, 30\u201343, 72\u201374, 271\u2013276}}</ref>\n\nIn 1943 the County Dublin Beekeepers' Association was formed, from which an attempt was made to revive the old IBA to form an ''all'' Ireland body.

In 1942 the UBKA was formed and in 1951 the smaller NIBKA affiliated with it and was later absorbed into it. In 1949 there were 6,000 beekeepers with 16,000 hives, the most common of which was the CDB Hive. At the 14th Annual Conference in 1959 a lecture was given entitled \"How to take advantage of the ''[[buckfast bee|Buckfast]]'' strain of bees, to be shortly introduced into Northern Ireland\". At the 15th Annual Conference in 1960 a member of the Ministry of Agriculture gave the lecture \"The Buckfast Strain of Honeybee and its dissemination throughout Northern Ireland\". In 1966 at the 21st Annual Conference of the UBKA it was decided that all subsequent Conferences should be held at Greenmount Agricultural and Horticultural College; it was also at this conference that the Ministry of Agriculture informed the UBKA \"that due to the increase of Nosema, the ''Buckfast'' Queen distribution scheme was being suspended\", a scheme initially begun to improve the local bee stock (the ''A. m. mellifera'' imported after the IoWD).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James K. |title=Bee-keeping in Ireland: A history. |date=1981 |publisher=The Glendale Press |isbn=978-0907606000 |pages=135}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 the FIBKA raised the subject of forming an All-Ireland Beekeepers' Alliance but the UBKA unanimously rejected the suggestion, opting instead to support continued co-operation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James K. |title=Bee-keeping in Ireland: A history. |date=1981 |publisher=The Glendale Press |isbn=978-0907606000 |pages=121\u2013123, 126\u2013129, 130}}</ref>\n\n==Honeybee diseases, pests and poisons==\n\n===Varroa===\nPresently the ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' mite is the single greatest threat to bee colonies in Ireland.

The earliest reference from within Ireland about bees are in the Bee Judgements of the [[Brehon Laws]] which among other issues dealt with the ownership and value of swarms, the compensation paid by the beekeeper to a person stung by one of his bees and the compensation paid to the beekeeper if a person's hens began eating his bees. The Brehon Laws began to be codified about 438-441 A.D. having been handed down orally from previous generations, they contain no [[Latin]] loan words relating to bees or beekeeping, which provides further evidence that beekeeping vocabulary was established before the arrival of Christianity in about 430 A.D. However legend has it that St. [[Modomnoc]] first brought bees to Ireland from [[Wales]] in the early 540's A.D. just after the effects of the [[extreme weather events of 535\u2013536]] A.D. would have been subsiding. A \"great mortality of bees\" was recorded in 950 A.D., and again in 992 A.D. when it was said that \"Bees were largely kept in Ireland at this time, and were a great source of wealth to the people\". In 1443 A.D \"the third [[epizooty]] of bees\" was recorded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Flemming |first1=George |title=Animal plagues: Their history, nature and prevention |date=1871 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animalplaguesthe00flem/page/53 53], 58, & 118 |url=https://archive.org/details/animalplaguesthe00flem |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first beekeeping book in Ireland was ''Instructions for managing bees'' in 1733, it included recommendations for the use of [[skep]]s and stipulated the best size to use to encourage at least one [[swarming (honey bee)|swarm]] per year with two afterswarms to follow. The bees would traditionally have been killed at the end of each season, often with the use of brimstone matches, to be able to extract the honey and wax. However, by the mid-1700s boxes for keeping bees had begun to be used and methods of extracting the honey and wax, without killing the bees, were being devised.\nIn the 1870s Brother Joeseph, a Carmelite monk from [[Loughrea]], imported a Bar and Frame Hive<ref>{{cite book |last1=W.
