Coal is valued for its [[Energy value of coal|energy content]] and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. [[Steel]] and [[cement]] industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from [[iron ore]] and for cement production. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]], a coal mine and its structures are a '''colliery''', a coal mine \u2013 a '''pit''', and the above-ground structures \u2013 a ''[[pit head]]''. In [[Australia]], \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the [[United States]], \"colliery\" has been used{{when|reason=No clear timeframe specified, \"nowadays\" is also unclear.|date=October 2019}} to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n\nCoal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] and [[Longwall mining|long wall]] mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of [[Dragline excavator|draglines]], trucks, [[conveyor]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s and shearers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of coal mining}}\n[[File:Boats hauling coal.jpg|thumb|Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.]]\nSmall-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in [[Roman Britain]], the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.<ref name = \"Smith 1997, 322\u2013324\">Smith, A. H. V. (1997): \"Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales\", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297\u2013324 (322\u20134).</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.<ref>National Archives, UK. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/lesson21.htm \"19th Century Mining Disaster.\"]</ref> Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, [[surface mining]] was conducted with [[steam shovel]]s designed for coal mining.\n\nMineworkers used rodents (mostly mice) and birds (canaries) underground to track the amount of concentrated carbon monoxide in the shafts. Small animals were more sensitive to danger. Miners kept an eye on mice, and any strange behaviors,  such as becoming lethargic or, on the contrary, making their way out of the shaft at the top speed, were a sign of coming troubles.<ref>Thomas Andrews \"Killing for Coal\" Harvard University Press(2008), pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Methods of extraction==\nCoal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called open cast) mine. Additionally coal seam thickness and geology are factors in selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which is a shear blade that runs along sections of the coal seam.  Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a [[coal preparation plant]]. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; [[overburden]] characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.<ref>[http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ \"Methods of Coal Mining\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121002/http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ |date=18 March 2012 }} ''Great Mining'' (2003) accessed 19 December 2011</ref>\n\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are usually surface mined.\n\nCoal that occurs at depths of {{convert|180|to|300|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam {{convert|60|\u2013|90|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5|order=flip}}. Coals occurring below {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on||round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\">Christman, R.C., J. Haslbeck, B. Sedlik, W. Murray, and W. Wilson. 1980. ''Activities, effects and impacts of the coal fuel cycle for a 1,000-MWe electric power generating plant''. Washington, DC: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ref> However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|ft|m|abbr=off|-1|order=flip}} below ground level, for instance [[Tagebau Hambach]] in Germany.\n\n===Surface mining===\n[[File:Cerrejonmine1.png|thumb|right|Trucks loaded with coal at the [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] coal mine in [[Colombia]]]]\nWhen coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using [[open cut]] (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the [[stratum|strata]] may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\nMost open cast mines in the United States extract [[bituminous coal]]. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, [[open cast mining]] is used for both [[thermal coal|thermal]] and [[metallurgical coal]]s. In [[New South Wales]] open casting for steam coal and [[anthracite]] is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\n====Strip mining====\nStrip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as 'overburden' and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.\n\nIt is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as [[dragline]]s, [[Power shovel|shovel]] and trucks, [[excavator]] and trucks, or [[Bucket-wheel excavator|bucket-wheels]] and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the\nunderlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.\n\nEquipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\">U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (1987). ''Surface coal mining reclamation: 10 years of progress, 1977\u20131987''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n====Contour mining====\nThe contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.\n\nThe limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.\n\n====Mountaintop removal mining====\n{{Main|Mountaintop removal}}\nMountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent \"valley fills.\" Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.\n\n[[Mountaintop removal]] combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden is\ndeposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\"/> The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of\ncreating ''head-of-hollow-fills'', or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029154012/http://mountainjusticesummer.org/facts/steps.php|archivedate=2005-10-29|title=Mountain Justice Summer \u2013 What is Mountain Top Removal Mining?|date=29 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Philadelphia, PA (2005). [http://www.epa.gov/region3/mtntop/eis2005.htm \"Mountaintop mining/valley fills in Appalachia: Final programmatic environmental impact statement.\"]</ref>\n\nSpoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\"/>\n\n===Underground mining===\n{{Main|Underground mining (soft rock)}}\n[[File:Coal Washer.JPG|thumb|right|Coal wash plant in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], [[Kentucky]]]]\nMost coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/> In deep mining, the [[room and pillar|room and pillar or bord and pillar]] method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or [[retreat mining]], is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.\n\nModern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.\n\n[[File:Continuous Miner.jpg|thumb|Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground]]\nThere are six principal methods of underground mining:\n* [[Longwall mining]] accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\" />\n* [[Continuous mining]] utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a \"room and pillar\" (also known as \"bord and pillar\") system&mdash;where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5\u201310 m) \"rooms\" or work areas cut into the coalbed&mdash;it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. [[Conveyor system|Conveyors]] transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|0}} (or a bit more with [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]] permission) (12 meters or roughly 40&nbsp;ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the \"continuous\" miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the \"continuous\" label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Room and pillar|Room and pillar mining]] consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the ''in situ'' coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (''see'' [[retreat mining]]).<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\">{{cite web|title=Coal Mining.

This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \u201ccutting\u201d the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Shortwall mining]], a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner shears coal panels {{convert|150|to|200|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5}} wide and more than a half-mile (1&nbsp;km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Retreat mining]] is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Top 5 Coal Producing Countries.png|thumb|Coal production trends 1980\u20132012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US EIA)]]\n[[File:Coal mine in Inner Mongolia 002.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[China]]]]\n[[File:Loy Yang open cut brown coal mine and dredgers.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[Australia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Major coal producing regions}}\nCoal is mined commercially in over 50 countries.

Exposure to excessive noise can lead to [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. Hearing loss developed as a result of occupational exposures is coined [[occupational hearing loss]]. To protect miners' hearing, the US [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]'s (MSHA) guidelines for noise place a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for noise at 90 dBA time-weighted over 8 hours. A lower cutoff, 85 dBA, is set for a worker to fall into the MSHA Action Level which dictates that workers be placed into hearing conservation programs.\n\nNoise exposures vary depending on the method of extraction. For example, a study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment produced the loudest sound at a range of 88\u2013112 dBA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=ER|date=April 2004|title=Worker exposure and equipment noise in large surface coal mines.|url=|journal=Min Eng|volume=56|pages=49\u201354|via=}}</ref> Within longwall sections, stageloaders used to transport coal from the mining face and shearers used for extraction represent some of the highest noise exposures.  Auxiliary fans (up to 120 dBA), continuous mining machines (up to 109 dBA), and roof bolters (up to 103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment within continuous mining sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1107.html|title=Summary of Longwall and Continuous Miner Section Noise Studies in Underground Coal Mines|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> Exposures to noise exceeding 90 dBA can lead to adverse effects on workers' hearing. The use of [[administrative controls]] and [[engineering controls]] can be used to reduce noise exposures.\n\n===Dangers from mining waste===\nIn the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster]] in Wales, a colliery [[spoil tip]] collapsed, engulfing a school and killing 116 children and 28 adults. Other accidents involving coal waste include the [[Martin County coal slurry spill]] (USA, 2000) and the [[Obed Mountain coal mine spill]] (Canada, 2013).\n\n===Safety Improvements===\n[[File:Make it Safer with Roof Screen.webm|thumb|A video on the use of roof screens in underground coal mines]]\nImprovements in mining methods (e.g. longwall mining), hazardous gas monitoring (such as [[safety-lamp]]s or more modern electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|electrical equipment]], and ventilation have reduced many of the risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with [[gas engines]].<ref>[http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/coal-gas/ Coal Gas Utilisation], www.clarke-energy.com</ref> Another innovation in recent years is the use of [[Self-contained self-rescue device|closed circuit escape respirator]]s, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/07/super-workplace/ |title = The Importance of Occupational Safety and Health: Making for a \"Super\" Workplace |date = 7 August 2013 |accessdate = 15 January 2015 |first1 = Jaclyn |last1 = Krah |first2 = Richard L. |last2 = Unger |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds.

''Permanent Regulatory Program Implementing Section 501(b) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977: Environmental Impact Statement''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of the Interior.</ref> This often results in a scarred landscape with no scenic value. Of greater concern, the movement, storage, and redistribution of soil during mining can disrupt the community of [[soil microbiology|soil microorganisms]] and consequently [[nutrient cycling]] processes. Rehabilitation or reclamation mitigates some of these concerns and is required by US Federal Law, specifically the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]].\n\nMine dumps ([[tailings]]) could produce [[acid mine drainage]] which can seep into [[waterways]] and [[aquifers]], with consequences on [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[human health]].\n\nIf underground mine tunnels collapse, they cause [[subsidence]] of the ground above. Subsidence can damage buildings, and disrupt the flow of streams and rivers by interfering with the natural [[drainage]].\n\nCoal production is a major contributor to [[global warming]]: burning coal generates large quantities of [[carbon dioxide]] and mining operations can release [[methane]], a known [[greenhouse gas]], into the atmosphere.

Although there is some evidence of [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of [[abandoned mined land]], which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface [[subsidence]] (6\u201312 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no [[air pollution]] control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.\n\n===Colombia===\nSome of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] in [[Colombia]] is one of the world's largest [[open pit]] mines. Output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). Cerrej\u00f3n contributed about half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150&nbsp;km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bol\u00edvar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port\noperate 24 hours per day. Cerrej\u00f3n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrej\u00f3n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in [[steel]] manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.\n\nThe expansion of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c04a21_55722707895847839433655205a851ff.pdf|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF COAL IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|title=Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n y Responsabilidad Social: Una revisi\u00f3n independiente de los impactos y del objetivo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174624/http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Ende Gel\u00e4nde 2017 CHB 23 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal mine in the [[Rhineland]] lignite mining area ([[Germany]]).]]\nGermany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Coal mining greatly increased during the [[industrial revolution]] and the following decades. The main mining areas were around [[Aachen]], the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]] area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.\nThese areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.\n\nCoal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (''Kohlepfennig''). In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, [[RAG AG]], the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in Germany.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|Jharia coal mine]]\n{{Main|Coal mining in India}}\nCoal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of [[Damodar River]]. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Daikodo of Horonai Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|The Daik\u014dd\u014d, the first [[adit]] of the [[Hokutan Horonai coal mine|Horonai mine]], dug in 1879.]]\n{{Main|List of coal mines in Japan}}\n\nThe richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on [[Hokkaido]] and [[Kyushu]].\n\nJapan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the [[Sengoku period|Japanese Middle Ages]].

Coal is valued for its [[Energy value of coal|energy content]] and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. [[Steel]] and [[cement]] industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from [[iron ore]] and for cement production. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[South Africa]], a coal mine and its structures are a '''colliery''', a coal mine \u2013 a '''pit''', and the above-ground structures \u2013 a ''[[pit head]]''. In [[Australia]], \"colliery\" generally refers to an underground coal mine. In the [[United States]], \"colliery\" has been used{{when|reason=No clear timeframe specified, \"nowadays\" is also unclear.|date=October 2019}} to describe a coal mine operation, but this usage is less common today.\n\nCoal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] and [[Longwall mining|long wall]] mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of [[Dragline excavator|draglines]], trucks, [[conveyor]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s and shearers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of coal mining}}\n[[File:Boats hauling coal.jpg|thumb|Ships have been used to haul coal since Roman times.]]\nSmall-scale mining of surface deposits dates back thousands of years. For example, in [[Roman Britain]], the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.<ref name = \"Smith 1997, 322\u2013324\">Smith, A. H. V. (1997): \"Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales\", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297\u2013324 (322\u20134).</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded rapidly when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth-century coal was mined underground using a pick and shovel, and children were often employed underground in dangerous conditions.<ref>National Archives, UK. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/lesson21.htm \"19th Century Mining Disaster.\"]</ref> Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s. By 1912, [[surface mining]] was conducted with [[steam shovel]]s designed for coal mining.\n\nMineworkers used rodents (mostly mice) and birds (canaries) underground to track the amount of concentrated carbon monoxide in the shafts. Small animals were more sensitive to danger. Miners kept an eye on mice, and any strange behaviors,  such as becoming lethargic or, on the contrary, making their way out of the shaft at the top speed, were a sign of coming troubles.<ref>Thomas Andrews \"Killing for Coal\" Harvard University Press(2008), pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Methods of extraction==\nCoal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called open cast) mine. Additionally coal seam thickness and geology are factors in selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which is a shear blade that runs along sections of the coal seam.  Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a [[coal preparation plant]]. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; [[overburden]] characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.<ref>[http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ \"Methods of Coal Mining\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121002/http://www.greatmining.com/articles/methods-of-coal-mining/ |date=18 March 2012 }} ''Great Mining'' (2003) accessed 19 December 2011</ref>\n\nSurface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately {{convert|180|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are usually surface mined.\n\nCoal that occurs at depths of {{convert|180|to|300|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on|round=5|order=flip}} are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam {{convert|60|\u2013|90|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5|order=flip}}. Coals occurring below {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on||round=5|order=flip}} are usually deep mined.<ref name=\"Christman, R.C. 1980\">Christman, R.C., J. Haslbeck, B. Sedlik, W. Murray, and W. Wilson. 1980. ''Activities, effects and impacts of the coal fuel cycle for a 1,000-MWe electric power generating plant''. Washington, DC: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ref> However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|ft|m|abbr=off|-1|order=flip}} below ground level, for instance [[Tagebau Hambach]] in Germany.\n\n===Surface mining===\n[[File:Cerrejonmine1.png|thumb|right|Trucks loaded with coal at the [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] coal mine in [[Colombia]]]]\nWhen coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using [[open cut]] (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the [[stratum|strata]] may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\nMost open cast mines in the United States extract [[bituminous coal]]. In Canada (BC), Australia and South Africa, [[open cast mining]] is used for both [[thermal coal|thermal]] and [[metallurgical coal]]s. In [[New South Wales]] open casting for steam coal and [[anthracite]] is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/>\n\n====Strip mining====\nStrip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as 'overburden' and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.\n\nIt is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as [[dragline]]s, [[Power shovel|shovel]] and trucks, [[excavator]] and trucks, or [[Bucket-wheel excavator|bucket-wheels]] and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the\nunderlying coal seam will be exposed (a 'block' of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.\n\nEquipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\">U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (1987). ''Surface coal mining reclamation: 10 years of progress, 1977\u20131987''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\n\n====Contour mining====\nThe contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.\n\nThe limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.\n\n====Mountaintop removal mining====\n{{Main|Mountaintop removal}}\nMountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent \"valley fills.\" Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.\n\n[[Mountaintop removal]] combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts.

In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.<ref name=\"Interior 1987\"/>\n\n===Underground mining===\n{{Main|Underground mining (soft rock)}}\n[[File:Coal Washer.JPG|thumb|right|Coal wash plant in [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]], [[Kentucky]]]]\nMost coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\"/> In deep mining, the [[room and pillar|room and pillar or bord and pillar]] method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or [[retreat mining]], is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.\n\nModern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support's legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.\n\n[[File:Continuous Miner.jpg|thumb|Remote Joy HM21 Continuous Miner used underground]]\nThere are six principal methods of underground mining:\n* [[Longwall mining]] accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\" />\n* [[Continuous mining]] utilizes a Continuous Miner Machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a \"room and pillar\" (also known as \"bord and pillar\") system&mdash;where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5\u201310 m) \"rooms\" or work areas cut into the coalbed&mdash;it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. [[Conveyor system|Conveyors]] transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|0}} (or a bit more with [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]] permission) (12 meters or roughly 40&nbsp;ft in South Africa before the Continuous Miner goes out and the roof is supported by the Roof Bolter), after which, the face has to be serviced, before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the \"continuous\" miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face (two major components of servicing) while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the \"continuous\" label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Room and pillar|Room and pillar mining]] consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the ''in situ'' coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (''see'' [[retreat mining]]).<ref name=\"CoalMining2009\">{{cite web|title=Coal Mining.

This process consists of a series of operations that begins with \u201ccutting\u201d the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Shortwall mining]], a method currently accounting for less than 1 percent of deep coal production, involves the use of a continuous mining machine with movable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner shears coal panels {{convert|150|to|200|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5}} wide and more than a half-mile (1&nbsp;km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* [[Retreat mining]] is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Top 5 Coal Producing Countries.png|thumb|Coal production trends 1980\u20132012 in the top five coal-producing countries (US EIA)]]\n[[File:Coal mine in Inner Mongolia 002.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[China]]]]\n[[File:Loy Yang open cut brown coal mine and dredgers.jpg|thumb|Coal mine in [[Australia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Major coal producing regions}}\nCoal is mined commercially in over 50 countries.

Although there is some evidence of [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of [[abandoned mined land]], which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface [[subsidence]] (6\u201312 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no [[air pollution]] control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.\n\n===Colombia===\nSome of the world's largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] in [[Colombia]] is one of the world's largest [[open pit]] mines. Output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). Cerrej\u00f3n contributed about half of Colombia's coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150&nbsp;km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bol\u00edvar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port\noperate 24 hours per day. Cerrej\u00f3n directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrej\u00f3n are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in [[steel]] manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.\n\nThe expansion of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c04a21_55722707895847839433655205a851ff.pdf|title=DIGGING DEEPER: THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS OF COAL IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|title=Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n y Responsabilidad Social: Una revisi\u00f3n independiente de los impactos y del objetivo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174624/http://www.cerrejon.com/site/Portals/0/Documents/pdf/tpr/INFORME_FINAL_PANEL_2008.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Ende Gel\u00e4nde 2017 CHB 23 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal mine in the [[Rhineland]] lignite mining area ([[Germany]]).]]\nGermany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Coal mining greatly increased during the [[industrial revolution]] and the following decades. The main mining areas were around [[Aachen]], the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]] area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.\nThese areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.\n\nCoal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (''Kohlepfennig''). In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, [[RAG AG]], the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ending coal mining in Germany.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|Jharia coal mine]]\n{{Main|Coal mining in India}}\nCoal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of [[Damodar River]]. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Daikodo of Horonai Coal Mine.jpg|thumb|The Daik\u014dd\u014d, the first [[adit]] of the [[Hokutan Horonai coal mine|Horonai mine]], dug in 1879.]]\n{{Main|List of coal mines in Japan}}\n\nThe richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on [[Hokkaido]] and [[Kyushu]].\n\nJapan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the [[Sengoku period|Japanese Middle Ages]].

The buildings that were in use for this purpose - the Exchange Buildings and Mechanics' Institute - were proving insufficient for the city's needs. As a result, a group of shareholders was brought together by the city's [[mayor]], Samuel Smith, in 1849 for the purpose of building a music hall.{{sfn|James|1866|p=123}} \u00a316,000 of capital was raised, in \u00a310 shares and a site on the corner of Bridge Street and Hall Ings was chosen as the location of the hall.

Previously, transition teams had been trained at several U.S. Army installations, most notably [[Fort Carson, Colorado]]; [[Camp Atterbury, Indiana]]; [[Fort Hood, Texas]]; and [[Camp Shelby, Mississippi]]. However, in early 2006, the U.S. Army decided to consolidate all training at [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], in order to standardize and improve training for that critical mission.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe first teams began training on June 1, 2006. The [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division]] took over command and control of the TT mission in October 2006. The brigade is responsible for the formation and training of the TT teams.  This mission shifted to [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]] later in 2009.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Triplet |first=William S. |date=2000 |editor-last=Ferrell |editor-first=Robert H. |editor-link=Robert Hugh Ferrell |title=A Youth in the Meuse-Argonne |pages=[https://archive.org/details/youthinmeuseargo00trip/page/4 4, 18\u201319, 267] |location=Columbia, MO |publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]] |isbn=0-8262-1290-5 |lccn=00029921 |oclc=43707198 |url=https://archive.org/details/youthinmeuseargo00trip/page/4 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n{{coord|39|05|46|N|96|43|35|W|region:US-KS_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}\n* http://griff-wjg.blogspot.com/2009_03_01_archive.html\n* http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/msgfisher/ww1pic.htm\n\n[[Category:Military facilities in Kansas]]\n", "name_user": "212.140.166.82", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Funston"}

The characters were turned into plush [[teddy bear]]s in 1983, and soon after appeared in the TV specials ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]''. They appeared in a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear is a different color and has a special \"belly badge\" that represents its personality.  Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, lamb, dog, cat, and horse created in the same style as the Care Bears.\n\nIn 2002, new versions of the bears were manufactured by Play-Along Toys; these new Care Bears appeared in three [[Computer animation|computer animated]] films: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005), and ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' (2007).\n\nA revival TV series titled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]'' aired on [[Discovery Family#As The Hub/Hub Network (2010\u20132014)|The Hub]] in 2012 for one season; a continuation with the same characters, ''Care Bears and Cousins'', was commissioned by [[Netflix]] and premiered in 2015. That year, toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figurines, and blind bag collectibles) based on the series.

Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (the home of the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen.\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot.\n\nThe 10 original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the TV series. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the film, Oopsy Bear, a Care Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.<ref name=cbsite />\n\nThroughout the films and various TV series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC TV series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced the wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]], and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the films, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim and Dum in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and the Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the film ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persist into the TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.\n\n===Magic spells===\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\", in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the tummy being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Care Bears and/or Care Bear Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The films ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear Stare, but it does return in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''. In the new TV series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the Care Bear Stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC TV series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC TV series to cure Care Bears and humans who were under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer up Grumpy Bear in the episode \"Tell-Tale Tummy\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their tummy symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges, and sending out a distress signal.\n\nUsually a tummy symbol\u2019s power is initiated by will, but in ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', a Care Bear has to rub their tummy in order to activate it. By ''Welcome to Care-a-lot'', the belly badges activate by will once again, though the bears may rub their belly to activate it on occasion.\n\n===Caring Meter===\nShown prominently in most of the ''Care Bears'' films and original TV series, the Caring Meter (renamed the Care-O-Meter in ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'') is typically in the center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the films and original TV series, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Care Bears or Care Bear Cousins see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling, or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white. If the meter were to reach all the way to zero, then Care-a-lot would be gone forever, along with everyone and everything in it.\n\n==Merchandise==\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards, and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.<ref name=\"cbfaq\" /> During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].<ref name=\"cbfaq\" />\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two Care Bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.<ref name=\"cbsite\" />\n\nIn his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"<ref name=pantheon>{{cite book|last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=[https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 98] |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]]) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 }}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}\nMany children's books have been based on, and featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include ''Meet the Care Bear Cousins'', ''Sweet Dreams for Sally'', ''The Witch Down the Street'', ''The Trouble with Timothy'', and ''A Sister for Sam''. All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" /> As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the Bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the Bears in the past.\n\nIn ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects\u2014and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"<ref name=rules>{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 217] |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 }}</ref>\n\n==Comics==\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

In 1983 five LPs were introduced: ''Introducing the Care Bears'', ''The Care Bears Care For You'', ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', ''The Care Bears' Birthday Party'', and ''The Care Bears' Christmas''. In 1986 ''Friends Make Everything Better'' was released as a promotion with [[Novartis|Trianimic]] cough medicine. They also released the soundtrack albums for the first films. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during this time.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" />\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for ''Birthday Party'') featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]].

The characters were turned into plush [[teddy bear]]s in 1983, and soon after appeared in the TV specials ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]''. They appeared in a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear is a different color and has a special \"belly badge\" that represents its personality.  Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, lamb, dog, cat, and horse created in the same style as the Care Bears.\n\nIn 2002, new versions of the bears were manufactured by Play-Along Toys; these new Care Bears appeared in three [[Computer animation|computer animated]] films: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005), and ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''

The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs.

Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (the home of the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen.\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot.\n\nThe 10 original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the TV series. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the film, Oopsy Bear, a Care Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.<ref name=cbsite />\n\nThroughout the films and various TV series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC TV series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced the wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]], and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the films, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim and Dum in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and the Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the film ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persist into the TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.\n\n===Magic spells===\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\", in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the tummy being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Care Bears and/or Care Bear Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The films ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear Stare, but it does return in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''. In the new TV series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the Care Bear Stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC TV series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC TV series to cure Care Bears and humans who were under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer up Grumpy Bear in the episode \"Tell-Tale Tummy\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their tummy symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges, and sending out a distress signal.\n\nUsually a tummy symbol\u2019s power is initiated by will, but in ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', a Care Bear has to rub their tummy in order to activate it. By ''Welcome to Care-a-lot'', the belly badges activate by will once again, though the bears may rub their belly to activate it on occasion.\n\n===Caring Meter===\nShown prominently in most of the ''Care Bears'' films and original TV series, the Caring Meter (renamed the Care-O-Meter in ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'') is typically in the center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the films and original TV series, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Care Bears or Care Bear Cousins see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling, or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white. If the meter were to reach all the way to zero, then Care-a-lot would be gone forever, along with everyone and everything in it.\n\n==Merchandise==\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards, and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.<ref name=\"cbfaq\" /> During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].<ref name=\"cbfaq\" />\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two Care Bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.<ref name=\"cbsite\" />\n\nIn his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"<ref name=pantheon>{{cite book|last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=[https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 98] |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]]) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/watchingtelevisi00gitl/page/98 }}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}\nMany children's books have been based on, and featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include ''Meet the Care Bear Cousins'', ''Sweet Dreams for Sally'', ''The Witch Down the Street'', ''The Trouble with Timothy'', and ''A Sister for Sam''. All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" /> As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the Bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the Bears in the past.\n\nIn ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects\u2014and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"<ref name=rules>{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 217] |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom) |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/playingbydiffere0000woja/page/217 }}</ref>\n\n==Comics==\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover ''Care Bear Annual'' books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the U.S. comic series.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}\nDuring the 1980s, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. In 1983 five LPs were introduced: ''Introducing the Care Bears'', ''The Care Bears Care For You'', ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', ''The Care Bears' Birthday Party'', and ''The Care Bears' Christmas''. In 1986 ''Friends Make Everything Better'' was released as a promotion with [[Novartis|Trianimic]] cough medicine. They also released the soundtrack albums for the first films. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during this time.<ref name=\"cbhistory\" />\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for ''Birthday Party'') featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]].
