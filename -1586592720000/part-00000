The thesis states that a mathematical method is effective if it could be set out as a list of instructions able to be followed by a human clerk with paper and pencil, for as long as necessary, and without ingenuity or insight.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nMachines that computed with continuous values became known as the ''analog'' kind. They used machinery that represented continuous numeric quantities, like the angle of a shaft rotation or difference in electrical potential.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nDigital machinery, in contrast to analog, were able to render a state of a numeric value and store each individual digit. Digital machinery used difference engines or relays before the invention of faster memory devices.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe phrase ''computing machine'' gradually gave way, after the late 1940s, to just ''computer'' as the onset of electronic digital machinery became common. These computers were able to perform the calculations that were performed by the previous human clerks.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nSince the values stored by digital machines were not bound to physical properties like analog devices, a logical computer, based on digital equipment, was able to do anything that could be described \"purely mechanical.\" The theoretical [[Turing Machine]], created by [[Alan Turing]], is a hypothetical device theorized in order to study the properties of such hardware.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n== Emergence of a discipline ==\n\n=== Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace ===\n{{Main|Charles Babbage|Ada Lovelace}}\n[[Charles Babbage]] is often regarded as one of the first pioneers of computing. Beginning in the 1810s, Babbage had a vision of mechanically computing numbers and tables. Putting this into reality, Babbage designed a calculator to compute numbers up to 8 decimal points long. Continuing with the success of this idea, Babbage worked to develop a machine that could compute numbers with up to 20 decimal places. By the 1830s, Babbage had devised a plan to develop a machine that could use punched cards to perform arithmetical operations. The machine would store numbers in memory units, and there would be a form of sequential control.  This means that one operation would be carried out before another in such a way that the machine would produce an answer and not fail. This machine was to be known as the \u201cAnalytical Engine\u201d, which was the first true representation of what is the modern computer.<ref name=\"Charles Babbage\" />\n\n[[Ada Lovelace]] (Augusta Ada Byron) is credited as the pioneer of computer programming and is regarded as a mathematical genius, a result of the mathematically heavy tutoring regimen her mother assigned to her as a young girl. Lovelace began working with Charles Babbage as an assistant while Babbage was working on his \u201cAnalytical Engine\u201d, the first mechanical computer.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=16}} During her work with Babbage, Ada Lovelace became the designer of the first computer algorithm, which had the ability to compute [[Bernoulli numbers]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} Moreover, Lovelace's work with Babbage resulted in her prediction of future computers to not only perform mathematical calculations, but also manipulate symbols, mathematical or not.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=20}} While she was never able to see the results of her work, as the \u201cAnalytical Engine\u201d was not created in her lifetime, her efforts in later years, beginning in the 1840s, did not go unnoticed.<ref name=\"Ada Lovelace\" />\n\n=== Alan Turing and the Turing machine ===\n{{Main|Alan Turing|Turing machine}}\nThe mathematical foundations of modern computer science began to be laid by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] with his [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]] (1931). In this theorem, he showed that there were limits to what could be proved and disproved within a [[formal system]]. This led to work by G\u00f6del and others to define and describe these formal systems, including concepts such as [[mu-recursive function]]s and [[lambda-definable functions]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn 1936  Alan Turing and [[Alonzo Church]] independently, and also together, introduced the formalization of an [[algorithm]], with limits on what can be computed, and a \"purely mechanical\" model for computing.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} This became the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]], a hypothesis about the nature of mechanical calculation devices, such as electronic computers. The thesis claims that any calculation that is possible can be performed by an algorithm running on a computer, provided that sufficient time and storage space are available.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn 1936, [[Alan Turing]] also published his seminal work on the [[Turing machine]]s, an abstract digital computing machine which is now simply referred to as the [[Universal Turing machine]]. This machine invented the principle of the modern computer and was the birthplace of the [[stored program]] concept that almost all modern day computers use.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">{{cite book|section-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/#ACE|section=Turing's Automatic Computing Engine|title=The Modern History of Computing|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2017}}</ref> These hypothetical machines were designed to formally determine, mathematically, what can be computed, taking into account limitations on computing ability.

Many people have acclaimed von Neumann as the \"father of the computer\" (in a modern sense of the term) but I am sure that he would never have made that mistake himself. He might well be called the midwife, perhaps, but he firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing...}}\n\n=== Akira Nakashima and switching circuit theory ===\nUp to and during the 1930s, electrical engineers were able to build electronic circuits to solve mathematical and logic problems, but most did so in an ''ad hoc'' manner, lacking any theoretical rigor.  This changed with [[NEC]] engineer Akira Nakashima's [[switching circuit theory]] in the 1930s. From 1934 to 1936, Nakashima published a series of papers showing that the [[Two-element Boolean algebra|two-valued]] [[Boolean algebra]], which he discovered independently (he was unaware of [[George Boole]]'s work until 1938), can describe the operation of switching circuits.<ref>[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejfms/124/8/124_8_720/_article History of Research on Switching Theory in Japan], ''IEEJ Transactions on Fundamentals and Materials'', Vol. 124 (2004) No. 8, pp. 720-726, [[Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan]]</ref><ref>[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0002.html Switching Theory/Relay Circuit Network Theory/Theory of Logical Mathematics], IPSJ Computer Museum, [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]</ref><ref name=\"historical\">Radomir S.

Since 1950, the von Neumann model provided uniformity in subsequent computer designs. The von Neumann architecture was considered innovative as it introduced an idea of allowing machine instructions and data to share memory space.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  The von Neumann model is composed of three major parts, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the memory, and the instruction processing unit (IPU). In von Neumann machine design, the IPU passes addresses to memory, and memory, in turn, is routed either back to the IPU if an instruction is being fetched or to the ALU if data is being fetched.<ref name=\"Von Neumann\" />\n\nVon Neumann's machine design uses a RISC (Reduced instruction set computing) architecture,{{dubious|reason=neologism, reduced from what?|date=April 2014}} which means the instruction set uses a total of 21 instructions to perform all tasks. (This is in contrast to CISC, [[complex instruction set computing]], instruction sets which have more instructions from which to choose.)  With von Neumann architecture, main memory along with the accumulator (the register that holds the result of logical operations)<ref name=\"Dictionary\" /> are the two memories that are addressed. Operations can be carried out as simple arithmetic (these are performed by the ALU and include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), conditional branches (these are more commonly seen now as <code>if</code> statements or <code>while</code> loops. The branches serve as <code>go to</code> statements), and logical moves between the different components of the machine, i.e., a move from the accumulator to memory or vice versa. Von Neumann architecture accepts fractions and instructions as data types. Finally, as the von Neumann architecture is a simple one, its register management is also simple.

The thesis states that a mathematical method is effective if it could be set out as a list of instructions able to be followed by a human clerk with paper and pencil, for as long as necessary, and without ingenuity or insight.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nMachines that computed with continuous values became known as the ''analog'' kind. They used machinery that represented continuous numeric quantities, like the angle of a shaft rotation or difference in electrical potential.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nDigital machinery, in contrast to analog, were able to render a state of a numeric value and store each individual digit. Digital machinery used difference engines or relays before the invention of faster memory devices.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe phrase ''computing machine'' gradually gave way, after the late 1940s, to just ''computer'' as the onset of electronic digital machinery became common. These computers were able to perform the calculations that were performed by the previous human clerks.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nSince the values stored by digital machines were not bound to physical properties like analog devices, a logical computer, based on digital equipment, was able to do anything that could be described \"purely mechanical.\" The theoretical [[Turing Machine]], created by [[Alan Turing]], is a hypothetical device theorized in order to study the properties of such hardware.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n== Emergence of a discipline ==\n\n=== Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace ===\n{{Main|Charles Babbage|Ada Lovelace}}\n[[Charles Babbage]] is often regarded as one of the first pioneers of computing. Beginning in the 1810s, Babbage had a vision of mechanically computing numbers and tables. Putting this into reality, Babbage designed a calculator to compute numbers up to 8 decimal points long. Continuing with the success of this idea, Babbage worked to develop a machine that could compute numbers with up to 20 decimal places. By the 1830s, Babbage had devised a plan to develop a machine that could use punched cards to perform arithmetical operations. The machine would store numbers in memory units, and there would be a form of sequential control.  This means that one operation would be carried out before another in such a way that the machine would produce an answer and not fail. This machine was to be known as the \u201cAnalytical Engine\u201d, which was the first true representation of what is the modern computer.<ref name=\"Charles Babbage\" />\n\n[[Ada Lovelace]] (Augusta Ada Byron) is credited as the pioneer of computer programming and is regarded as a mathematical genius, a result of the mathematically heavy tutoring regimen her mother assigned to her as a young girl. Lovelace began working with Charles Babbage as an assistant while Babbage was working on his \u201cAnalytical Engine\u201d, the first mechanical computer.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=16}} During her work with Babbage, Ada Lovelace became the designer of the first computer algorithm, which had the ability to compute [[Bernoulli numbers]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} Moreover, Lovelace's work with Babbage resulted in her prediction of future computers to not only perform mathematical calculations, but also manipulate symbols, mathematical or not.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=20}} While she was never able to see the results of her work, as the \u201cAnalytical Engine\u201d was not created in her lifetime, her efforts in later years, beginning in the 1840s, did not go unnoticed.<ref name=\"Ada Lovelace\" />\n\n=== Alan Turing and the Turing machine ===\n{{Main|Alan Turing|Turing machine}}\nThe mathematical foundations of modern computer science began to be laid by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] with his [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]] (1931). In this theorem, he showed that there were limits to what could be proved and disproved within a [[formal system]].

This changed with [[NEC]] engineer Akira Nakashima's [[switching circuit theory]] in the 1930s. From 1934 to 1936, Nakashima published a series of papers showing that the [[Two-element Boolean algebra|two-valued]] [[Boolean algebra]], which he discovered independently (he was unaware of [[George Boole]]'s work until 1938), can describe the operation of switching circuits.<ref>[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejfms/124/8/124_8_720/_article History of Research on Switching Theory in Japan], ''IEEJ Transactions on Fundamentals and Materials'', Vol. 124 (2004) No. 8, pp. 720-726, [[Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan]]</ref><ref>[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0002.html Switching Theory/Relay Circuit Network Theory/Theory of Logical Mathematics], IPSJ Computer Museum, [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]</ref><ref name=\"historical\">Radomir S.

Since 1950, the von Neumann model provided uniformity in subsequent computer designs. The von Neumann architecture was considered innovative as it introduced an idea of allowing machine instructions and data to share memory space.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  The von Neumann model is composed of three major parts, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the memory, and the instruction processing unit (IPU). In von Neumann machine design, the IPU passes addresses to memory, and memory, in turn, is routed either back to the IPU if an instruction is being fetched or to the ALU if data is being fetched.<ref name=\"Von Neumann\" />\n\nVon Neumann's machine design uses a RISC (Reduced instruction set computing) architecture,{{dubious|reason=neologism, reduced from what?|date=April 2014}} which means the instruction set uses a total of 21 instructions to perform all tasks. (This is in contrast to CISC, [[complex instruction set computing]], instruction sets which have more instructions from which to choose.)  With von Neumann architecture, main memory along with the accumulator (the register that holds the result of logical operations)<ref name=\"Dictionary\" /> are the two memories that are addressed. Operations can be carried out as simple arithmetic (these are performed by the ALU and include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), conditional branches (these are more commonly seen now as <code>if</code> statements or <code>while</code> loops. The branches serve as <code>go to</code> statements), and logical moves between the different components of the machine, i.e., a move from the accumulator to memory or vice versa. Von Neumann architecture accepts fractions and instructions as data types. Finally, as the von Neumann architecture is a simple one, its register management is also simple. The architecture uses a set of seven registers to manipulate and interpret fetched data and instructions. These registers include the \"IR\" (instruction register), \"IBR\" (instruction buffer register), \"MQ\" (multiplier quotient register), \"MAR\" (memory address register), and \"MDR\" (memory data register).\"<ref name=\"Von Neumann\" />  The architecture also uses a program counter (\"PC\") to keep track of where in the program the machine is.<ref name=\"Von Neumann\" />\n\n=== Transistors and the computer revolution ===\n{{See|History of the transistor|MOSFET|Information Age}}\n\nThe concept of a [[field-effect transistor]] was proposed by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] in 1925.

This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the [[Early Modern Period]].\n\n==Modern development==\nIt was not until the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.\n\nThe practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,<ref name=\"BoiseStateI\">{{cite web |last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I.

The\nsecond was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty.

She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.\n\n[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]\nShe also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.<ref name=\"dnb\">Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 \"Hill, Octavia (1838\u20131912)\",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010</ref> At first Hill believed, \"Voluntary workers are a necessity.

Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]].

A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population.

This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.<ref>Alfred Marshall, \"[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]\", ed.

They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.<ref name=\"BoiseStateIII\"/>\n\nThe movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were \"...a foundation for social work practice in this country\".<ref>Reyes, J. M. (2008).

Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}</ref> Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: \"I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations.\"<ref>[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]</ref>\n\nRowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working-class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.<ref>Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.</ref> The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.<ref>Rowntree, B S: \"Poverty: A Study in Town Life\", page 298. Macmillan and CO., 1901</ref>\n\nRowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \"necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.\n\nIn analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle<ref>Searle, G R: \"A New England?\", page 196.

In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.<ref name=\"Social Work\">{{cite journal | last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra | author2 = Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127\u2013134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url = http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | pmid = 16858918 | doi = 10.1093/sw/51.2.127 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630195743/http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | archive-date = 30 June 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question \"is social work a profession?\" lingered.

In one hand there discourse reinforced the dualist vision of social roles, considering care work was appropriate with the characteristic women were supposed to have (e.g. softness, empathy, solicitude, love, abnegation, etc.). On the other hand, they affirmed a will to change women's place in society by giving them more power and better recognition. Conversely, when feminists are absent, this has an impact on the professionalisation process, relegating women in the margins. This appears particularly in a study on professionalisation of socio-cultural community work from the 1960s in Switzerland.<ref>Togni, C. & Malatesta, D. (2019).

The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered \"deserving enough\" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.<ref name=gehlert/>\n\nThe first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.\n\nThis approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.<ref name=gehlert/>  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.\n\n==State Welfare==\n[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]\nAs the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.<ref name='eatwell'>{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}</ref> A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences.

This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.\n\nThis is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, M. (2011).

This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the [[Early Modern Period]].\n\n==Modern development==\nIt was not until the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.\n\nThe practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,<ref name=\"BoiseStateI\">{{cite web |last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I.

The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organisation Society]] in the mid-19th century. The\nsecond was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the [[settlement house]] movement.<ref name=\"Lymbery\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}</ref>\n\nThis was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems.

She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.\n\n[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]\nShe also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.<ref name=\"dnb\">Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 \"Hill, Octavia (1838\u20131912)\",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010</ref> At first Hill believed, \"Voluntary workers are a necessity.

Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.\n\nThe settlement was named after [[Arnold Toynbee]], an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]]. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and [[co-operative]]s. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.\n\nIn America, the settlement movement was established by [[Jane Addams]], a young medical student, and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]] in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.<ref name=\"Danilov pp. 356-357\">{{cite book|author=Victor J.

This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.<ref>Alfred Marshall, \"[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]\", ed.

They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.<ref name=\"BoiseStateIII\"/>\n\nThe movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were \"...a foundation for social work practice in this country\".<ref>Reyes, J. M. (2008).

The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.\n\n===Further Development===\n[[Image:Dublin Slum dwellers 1901 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Poverty in towns, slum dwellers in [[Dublin]], Ireland circa 1901.]]\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}</ref> Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: \"I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations.\"<ref>[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]</ref>\n\nRowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working-class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.<ref>Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.</ref> The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.<ref>Rowntree, B S: \"Poverty: A Study in Town Life\", page 298. Macmillan and CO., 1901</ref>\n\nRowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \"necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.\n\nIn analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle<ref>Searle, G R: \"A New England?\", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.<ref>[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html Joseph Rowntree Foundation Centenary: Poverty<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011147/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html |date=2008-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.<ref name=\"Social Work\">{{cite journal | last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra | author2 = Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127\u2013134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url = http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | pmid = 16858918 | doi = 10.1093/sw/51.2.127 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630195743/http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | archive-date = 30 June 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question \"is social work a profession?\" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. [[Abraham Flexner]] spoke on the topic \"Is Social Work a Profession?\" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.<ref name=\"UM-SSW\">{{cite web|title = From Charitable Volunteers to Architects of Social Welfare: A Brief History of Social Work |publisher = [[University of Michigan]] |url =http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html |accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref> This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method.\n\n== Gender perspective in the history of social work ==\nThe importance of the role of women, in particular of feminist organisations, had in the history of social work has been highlighted by several historical studies <ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Social Work in Europe (1900\u20131960)|date=2003|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften|isbn=978-3-8100-3635-3|editor-last=Hering|editor-first=Sabine|location=Wiesbaden|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-80895-0|editor-last2=Waaldijk|editor-first2=Berteke}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Amid social contradictions : towards a history of social work in Europe|date=2009|publisher=Barbara Budrich Publishers|others=Hauss, Gisela, 1956-, Schulte, Dagmar, 1959-|isbn=978-3-86649-150-2|location=Opladen|oclc=231588556}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bortoli, Bruno.|title=I giganti del lavoro sociale : grandi donne (e grandi uomini) nella storia del welfare (1526-1939) Nuova edizione|date=2013|publisher=Erickson|isbn=978-88-590-0165-2|location=Trento|oclc=830362838}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/social-work-history-gender-and-class-profession|title=Social work: A history of gender and class in the profession {{!}} ephemera|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref>Revue suisse de travail social, n\u00b023 (2018).

In one hand there discourse reinforced the dualist vision of social roles, considering care work was appropriate with the characteristic women were supposed to have (e.g. softness, empathy, solicitude, love, abnegation, etc.). On the other hand, they affirmed a will to change women's place in society by giving them more power and better recognition. Conversely, when feminists are absent, this has an impact on the professionalisation process, relegating women in the margins. This appears particularly in a study on professionalisation of socio-cultural community work from the 1960s in Switzerland <ref>Togni, C. & Malatesta, D. (2019). Feminism and the professionalisation of social work : a socio-historical approach through two Swiss examples (1910-1970). ''Contemporanea, 22''(2), 282-287.</ref>.  This study shows that men were hired as socio-cultural community workers to develop youth activities, especially with teenage boys, while status of women were less prestigious (assistant, social carers or child care workers) and the child care work they were attributed to viewed as not (or less) relevant for the \u00ab ''socio-cultural'' community work project \u00bb of the centres <ref>Dallera, C., Malatesta, D. & Togni, C.

The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered \"deserving enough\" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.<ref name=gehlert/>\n\nThe first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.\n\nThis approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.<ref name=gehlert/>  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.\n\n==State Welfare==\n[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]\nAs the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.<ref name='eatwell'>{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}</ref> A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences.

In the early 1900s, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H.

This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.\n\nThis is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, M. (2011).
