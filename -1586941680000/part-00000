The club plays its home matches at the [[Halton Stadium]]. Founded as Widnes Football Club, they are one of the original twenty-two rugby clubs that formed the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] in 1895, making them one of the world's first rugby league teams. Their historic nickname is \"The Chemics\" after the main industry in Widnes, but now they use their modern nickname, \"The Vikings\".\n\nThe club enjoyed a period of success in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, and were frequently described as \"Cup Kings\" reaching the [[Challenge Cup]] Final 7 times in 10 years between 1975 and 1984. In 1989, after winning their third [[Rugby League Premiership]], Widnes became the first official [[World Club Challenge|World Club Champions]] by beating the Australian champions [[Canberra Raiders]] 30-18 at [[Old Trafford]]. They have a strong local rivalry with [[Warrington Wolves]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n[[File:F&A Guardian 1875 extract.jpg|thumb|left|A newspaper extract from the Widnes Guardian in 1875 announcing the formation of Farnworth & Appleton Football Club.|alt=A newspaper extract from the Farnworth & Appleton Guardian in 1875 announcing the formation of Farnworth & Appleton Football Club.]]\nThe Farnworth & Appleton Cricket Club was formed in 1871 and four years later the members decided to embrace the burgeoning football code. At their fourth annual evening party in the Drill Hall, Widnes, in November 1875, club Chairman Henry Lea \"gave a short account of the club since it commenced about four years ago, and indicated that they had now started a football club in connexion (sic) with it, and hoped all would join\". The first known game for the new Farnworth and Appleton FC was in Widnes in January 1876 played under rugby rules against Northwich Victoria. A few weeks later a return match was played at Drill Field, Northwich under soccer rules. Vics won both games. These are the only two known fixtures in that truncated first season.\n\nBy May 1876 the club had changed its name to Widnes FC and the cricket side of the organisation had disbanded, presumably to concentrate on football activities. By the late 1870s the club was being referred to as \"The Chemicals\"\u2014subsequently shortened to 'The Chemics'.\n\nThe first ground was on Albert Road behind what is now the Premier Wetherspoon's pub and a short spell followed in the Simms Cross area. From around 1878\u201384 the club were based at the junction of Millfield/Peelhouse Lane, apart from season 1880\u201381 when they played on the Widnes Cricket Club ground at Lowerhouse Lane. From 1884\u201395 they rented a field at Lowerhouse Lane before moving to their third separate site on that road in October 1895. The first ever game at what later became [[Halton Stadium|Naughton Park]] was against Liversedge on Saturday 12 October 1895.\n\nIn 1895, Widnes were founder members of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] which broke away from the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Their first game was an away fixture against Runcorn which they lost 15\u20134. During the early years, the club often had to sell players to balance the books. The strength of junior rugby league in the area meant the club had a steady stream of new players to offset any losses.\n\nIn 1902, the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues were combined to form a second division, Widnes was added to the first division.\n\nIn 1914, [[Arthur Johnson (rugby league)|Arthur 'Chick' Johnson]] was capped for the Lions (captained by Harold Wagstaff) in the famous [[Rorke's Drift test]], a match in which they overcame all the odds, and injuries to beat Australia with a depleted side of 10 against 13. He scored an extraordinary try to win the game, dribbling the ball from inside his own half. Widnes closed for the 1915-16 season but recommenced playing in 1916 following the introduction of conscription which meant that would not be accused of keeping men from volunteering for the First World War. Thirteen Widnes players were killed during the conflict.\n\nThe club's first ever success came when they won the Lancashire League trophy in the 1919\u201320 season. However, the 1920s saw the club almost go to the wall. Local rivals Warrington donated their share of the traditional Easter and Christmas [[derby match]]es to keep Widnes afloat in 1927\u201328.\n\nIn 1930, Widnes with 12 local-born players defied the odds to beat [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] 10\u20133 to bring home the [[Challenge Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_league/ray_french/2949991.stm |title= Widnes Field 12 Local Players - 1930 Challenge Cup Final |accessdate=2003-04-23 |publisher=BBC | date=24 April 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingsway housing scheme threatened the loss of Widnes' ground. After several years of fundraising during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, \u00a33,250 was raised to save the ground. This came with a stipulation that the ground could be sold only to the local council at the original price. The newly named [[Halton Stadium|Naughton Park]] was opened in 1932.\n\nA major boost for the club was Widnes' first ever trip to the Challenge Cup final, staged at Wembley. Their opponents were [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], Saints scored after six minutes to take a 3\u20130 lead, but Widnes hit back with a penalty try, a further try and a penalty to take a 10\u20133 half-time lead. A scoreless second half meant Widnes had won the cup.\n\nWidnes became the first club to make two trips to Wembley, with a loss to [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] in the 1934 cup final.\n\nIn 1935\u201336, the team came close to being rugby league champions. Having finished third in the table, Widnes beat Liverpool 10\u20139 but lost to [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]], in the championship final. A third trip to Wembley came in 1937, with an 18\u20135 win over [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]]. The final was dubbed \"McCue's Match\" as the halfback played an important part in the win.\n\nWidnes dropped out of the wartime Lancashire league in 1940\u201341 and did not return to league competition until 1945\u201346.\n\n===Post war===\n\nTommy McCue led the club to its first ever [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] win, with a 7\u20133 victory against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in 1945.\n\nBack at Wembley in 1950, the team was beaten 19\u20130 by [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]]. During this period, the club reverted to selling its players to richer teams.\n\nLocal man [[Vince Karalius]] joined Widnes from St. Helens in 1962 and was appointed club captain. In his first season, Widnes finished third in the Championship, which equalled the club's best league placing. In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Widnes and [[Workington Town]] met at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], [[Wigan]], in the first final of the [[Rugby league county leagues|Western Division]] Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962. With two minutes remaining, Lowdon dropped a goal to earn Workington a 9\u20139 draw. Later in the month [[Workington Town]] won the replay 10\u20130.\n\nThe following season saw him lead his team to Wembley, where Widnes were Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] winners after they defeated [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] 13\u20135. No team had ever played more games in reaching Wembley than Widnes in 1964. In the first round, two replays were necessary before beating [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]. [[Liverpool Stanley|Liverpool City]] were beaten in the second round, then Widnes played [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]] in front of 19,000 at Naughton Park. A 5\u20135 draw meant another replay, which was a scoreless draw at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]]. A second replay at Wigan was watched by 21,369 with Widnes winning 15\u20133. The semi-final against [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]] was drawn 7\u20137. A crowd of 28,732 spectators watched the replay, which Widnes won. A Wembley crowd of 84,488 saw Widnes win the Challenge Cup for the third time with a 13\u20135 victory over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. This was the Chemics first trophy success in eighteen years.''\n\n===The ''\"Cup Kings\"''===\nThe 1970s saw the first really outstanding Widnes team. A host of young local players developed into the \"Cup Kings\", a golden age for the club. The first cup-final was a loss in the 1971\u201372 [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]].\n\nSix years after he retired from playing [[Vince Karalius]] returned to Widnes as coach; appointed in January 1972. The following two seasons, Widnes reached the finals of the [[BBC2 Floodlit Trophy]]. The first success came in the 1975 Lancashire Cup which Widnes won by beating [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] that season. They also won the 1975 Challenge Cup final 14\u20137 versus Warrington at Wembley. This was the first time in their history that Widnes had won two trophies in the same season. At his zenith, Karalius, stepped down once from his role as coach. He was replaced in May 1975 by [[Frank Myler]].\n\nWidnes visited Wembley in the following two seasons, losing to [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] and then [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. However, this was made up for by victories in the [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] and [[John Player Trophy]]. The season after this (1977\u201378) saw their first league championship. The team went through the season unbeaten at home in the league. There were also trips to the John Player and Premiership finals.\n\n[[Keith Elwell]] began his run of 242 consecutive appearances at Wembley in the [[1976\u201377 Northern Rugby Football League season|1976\u201377]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final, including two as a substitute. He finished his run at [[Hull F.C.]] on 26 September 1982. This record for consecutive appearances for one club stands to this day.\n\n[[Doug Laughton]] took over the job of team coach when Frank Myler retired from the position in 1978. The 1978\u201379 season saw no less than four cups come to Widnes\u2014the BBC2 floodlit trophy, Lancashire Cup, Premiership and a win at Wembley over [[Wakefield Trinity]] in front of a crowd of 93,218. Widnes also defeated the [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes]]-winning [[1978 Kangaroo tour]]ists.\n\nThe 1979\u201380 season saw Widnes beat [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] in the Premiership final, but come second to them in the league and John Player Trophy. The Lancashire Cup was won for the fifth time in the 1970s.\n\nThe 1980s started with a Wembley win over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] in 1980\u201381. The season after this, Widnes again returned to Wembley, to face [[Hull F.C.]] Widnes led 14\u20136 with less than 20 minutes to go, but the game finished 14\u201314 and Hull won the replay 18\u20139 at [[Elland Road]], [[Leeds United FC|Leeds]]. Widnes kept their record of winning a cup every season by defeating Hull 23\u20138 in the Premiership final. The next season saw Hull again beaten by Widnes in the Premiership final.\n\n[[Vince Karalius]] returned to the club in March 1983 as co-coach with Harry Dawson. Dawson quit as coach in March 1984 with Karalius continuing as team manager. Karalius led a strong Widnes side to the finals of the Lancashire Cup and John Player Trophy and another Wembley victory appearance 19\u20136 against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]].\n\n[[Doug Laughton]] returned to the club in January 1986 and began a series of signings of players from other league clubs and from rugby union. One such player was [[Martin Offiah]], who in 1987\u201388 scored a club record 42 tries. The team went on to win the championship that season, clinching it with a 50-point win away over [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]]. Widnes then beat St. Helens in the Premiership Final at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]] a game in which [[Alan Tait]] made his d\u00e9but.\n\nThe 1988\u201389 season saw the club sign rugby union star [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] from [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] for \u00a3225,000. Wigan were beaten in the Charity Shield but had their revenge in the Regal Trophy Final. The Championship came down to the last game of the season, a capacity crowd at Naughton Park saw Widnes beat Wigan 32\u201318 to win the title for the second year running. The Premiership was won again, with over 40,000 at Old Trafford to see Widnes beat Hull 18\u201310.\n\nThe 1989\u201390 season saw Widnes play at [[Anfield]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beating Wigan 27\u201322. A trip to France to play Le Pontet saw Widnes chosen as the [[Northern Hemisphere]] representatives to meet Australia's Grand Final winners. [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] took a 12\u20130 lead but were then swept aside as Widnes stormed home 30\u201318 to become the [[1989 World Club Challenge|first official World Club Champions]].\n\nHowever, financial problems riddled the club in the early 1990s. To balance the books, over 25 first team players were sold to other teams. This resulted in the club sinking to 12th in the division one table, avoiding relegation.\n\nMyler became coach of Widnes in May 1994. In August 1995 the club decided to bring back [[Doug Laughton]] for a third stint as team manager which resulted in Myler's sacking as coach.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Widnes sack coach Tony Myler | work = Independent, The | place = | pages = | language = | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 1995-08-12 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/widnes-sack-coach-tony-myler-1595927.html | accessdate = 2009-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Summer era===\nIn 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural [[Super League]] season and changed from a winter to a summer season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/rugbys-pounds-87m-deal-gives-murdoch-transfer-veto-1526582.html |title=Rugby's pounds 87m deal gives Murdoch transfer veto |accessdate=9 December 2009 |publisher=Runcorn and Widnes World| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mhXzhohx | archivedate= 2010-01-11 | location=London | first=Dave | last=Hadfield | date=20 December 1995}}</ref> When the RFL announced that a new 12-team Super League was to be formed a chaotic period ensued in which the club was out, then in, then out, then in merged with local rivals Warrington and then finally out again as they finished below the cut-off point of 10th in the existing top flight.\n\nThe club adopted the name ''Widnes Vikings'' on 27 November 1996; the club had originally intended to adopt the moniker 'Warriors' but were asked to reconsider by the RFL, as Whitehaven were planning to adopt this name also. Further player and coaching departures ensued and the club struggled in the new first division, the club's first ever finish in the relegation zone followed. They spent the next five years in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]].\n\n[[Graeme West]] took over as coach after [[Doug Laughton]]'s third stint, his reign lasted from May 1997 until August 1998. During this time, the playing arena was rebuilt and the old stands, terraces and facilities were demolished to be replaced with a state-of-the-art all-seater stadium and was also renamed from Naughton Park to the Halton Community Stadium. West was later replaced as coach by [[Colin Whitfield]].\n\nIn 1999 Widnes narrowly missed out on a place in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] Grand Final. The 2000 season was one of transition with head coach Colin Whitfield being sacked and replaced by [[David Hulme (rugby league)|David Hulme]]. A record attendance for the newly rebuilt stadium was set at 6,644 for a Northern Ford Premiership game against [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] on [[Boxing Day]] 2000. Widnes finished off a poor season in 8th place in the NFP.\n\nUnder new coach [[Neil Kelly]], Widnes won promotion to [[Super League]] in 2001 after beating [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 24\u201312 in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] Grand Final.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/3009731/Cantillon-sees-Widnes-to-brink-of-elite.html |title= Cantillon sees Widnes to brink of elite |accessdate=2001-07-28 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5mgLXtl9w | archivedate= 2010-01-10 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Crossley | date=28 July 2001}}</ref>\n\nTheir d\u00e9but season in the [[Super League]] was in 2002, and the Vikings surprised everyone by narrowly missing out on a play-off place, and finishing seventh.\n\nThe following season saw them consolidate with a 9th place finish, and in 2004 they avoided relegation on the final day of the season, with [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford's]] defeat by [[Wakefield Trinity]] saving Widnes' fate. [[Stuart Spruce]] was caretaker manager.\n\n[[Frank Endacott]] arrived at Widnes as coach in 2005, but could not improve on the previous seasons. With two teams being relegated in 2005, due to the inclusion of [[Catalans Dragons]] in Superleague from 2006 onwards, Widnes were relegated back down to the second tier of the English game (LHF National League 1).\n\nWidnes parted company with coach Frank Endacott, and new coach [[Steve McCormack]] rebuilt the squad, which notably included Australian full back [[David Peachey]], who kept his word to join the club, despite its relegation.\n\n[[Stephen Vaughan, Sr.|Stephen Vaughan]] completed a take-over of Widnes in 2006<ref>[http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-city-fc/chester-city-fc-news/tm_objectid=16885355&method=full&siteid=50020&headline=vaughan-in-new-pledge-name_page.html Vaughan in new pledge] ''Chester Chronicle''. 31-05-06.

The club also reached the 2010 [[Co-operative Championship]] playoffs but were knocked out in the opening round by [[Barrow Raiders]].\n\n===Return to Super League===\nIn 2011 Widnes were granted a [[Super League]] licence for the 2012-14 seasons and [[Denis Betts]] was confirmed as the man who would coach the club. A flourish of new signings were announced and the pioneering 'Viking Stronghold' initiative moved from strength to strength. Widnes also installed a fourth generation artificial pitch (or ipitch as it became known) during the off season, making them the first team in modern day rugby league to not play on a traditional grass pitch. Widnes' tenancy in the [[Co-operative Championship]] culminated in September 2011 with a fifth place league finish, and a first round playoff defeat of 36-20 by [[Sheffield Eagles]] at [[Bramall Lane]].\n\nFebruary 2012 saw Widnes' re-emergence into the top tier of rugby league, and they claimed their first two points against [[Wigan Warriors]]  in a 37-36 win. The club managed to prove a number of critics wrong by gaining 12 points in total by the end of their first season back, but this was not enough to prevent the club from finishing at the bottom of the [[Super League]] table.\n\nThe 2013 season saw a marked improvement on the field by Widnes, with the team earning a total of 22 league points and finishing 10th in the [[Super League]] table.\n\nThe 2014 season proved to be the most successful season of the franchise period, with the club finishing eighth in the [[Super League]] table on 27 points  and subsequently qualifying for the end of season play-offs for the first time in their history. A 22-19 away defeat by the [[Warrington Wolves]] brought the curtain down on a season that can only be seen as a success for the Vikings, with a [[Challenge Cup]] Semi-Final appearance against the [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]] being the key highlight. However, it was also during the 2014 season that the club received the news that \"legendary supporter\" <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.widnesvikings.co.uk/article/39706/pat-price.stm|title=Pat Price 1937-2014|accessdate=2014-07-12 |publisher=Widnes Vikings | date=12 July 2014 }}</ref> Pat Price had died and condolences for 'the first lady of Rugby League' were received from clubs and supporters throughout the sport.\n\nThe RFL overhauled [[Super League]] for the 2015 season, scrapping the Franchise System <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/28464023}}</ref> and re-adopted promotion & relegation. Widnes finished in 9th position on 19 points, and then went on to consolidate their [[Super League]] status in the Middle 8's.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/rugby-league/news/article/480/9927945/super-8s-qualifiers-championship-shield-fixtures-schedule-results}}</ref>\n\nThe 2016 season saw the Vikings put together a number of early exciting performances, including defeating the previous season's champions Leeds Rhinos 56-12. This placed Widnes top of the Super League table, heading into the Easter fixtures. Before the start of the 2017 Widnes sold their inspirational captain and best player to their bitter rivals Warrington Wolves. This move was completed whilst Brown was still in contract and despite warnings from fans was the beginning of the end for Widnes as a potential mid table team.\n\nIn 2017 the team finished bottom but avoided relegation by beating Catalans Dragons and the Million Pound Game.\nThe lack of ambition of the club was now available for everybody to see with Chairman Steven O\u2019Connor washing his hands of the club and moving to Australia in order to pursue further business projects. This was done without O\u2019Connor fulfilling his promise to the club and town that the club would not be entering Super League to \u201cMake up the numbers\u201d. The current board headed by James Rule failed to heed the mistakes of the 2017 season and further recruitment to the squad was extremely poor. This lack of ambition and value for money has resulted in fans walking away from the club in their droves.\n\n===Vikings Resurgence===\nIn March 2019 after narrowly escaping liquidation, Thanks in large part to crowdfunding pages setup by the remaining Widnes Vikings fans.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/fundraising-widnes-vikings-approaches-50000-15881346 |title=Widnes Vikings: Fundraising for Widnes Vikings approaches \u00a350,000 in bid to stave off liquidation threat |work=Cheshire Live|date= 25 February 2019 |accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> Newly appointed Head Coach Kieron Purtill has been leading the boys in a moderately successful streak of wins, culminating in reaching the finals of the [[2019 RFL 1895 Cup]] against [[Sheffield Eagles]].\n\n==Relegation and financial problems==\nThe 2018 season continued as the previous one with few quality signings and a team no longer good enough to compete in Super League. The club lost nineteen games in a row, which led to coach Denis Betts being dismissed with Francis Cummins taking interim charge; however, he could not prevent the club from falling into the Championship. On 1 February 2019, CEO James Rule resigned because the club faced significant financial challenges as a result of relegation. Speculation about the future of the club began to mount following a significant silence by the club's then chairman, Steve O\u2019Connor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.runcornandwidnesworld.co.uk/sport/17403827.james-rule-gives-an-update-as-he-steps-down-at-widnes-vikings/|title=James Rule gives an update as he steps down at Widnes Vikings|website=Runcorn and Widnes World}}</ref>\n\nThe club went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] on 22 February 2019 after a take-over bid failed; as a result of this development the [[Rugby Football League]] imposed a 12-point penalty on the club and their upcoming game against Sheffield was postponed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/47323878 |title=Widnes Vikings go into administration and are deducted 12 points by RFL |work=BBC Sport|date=22 February 2019 |accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> Following a fundraising campaign, supported by fans and other rugby league clubs, over \u00a3100,000 was raised.

This may result in criminal proceedings against those responsible if any wrongdoing is\ndiscovered.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/47422551 |title=Widnes Vikings: RFL accepts new takeover deal but still imposes 12-point penalty |work=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2019 |accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Halton Stadium==\n{{main|Halton Stadium}}\nThe club's home ground is [[Halton Stadium]]. The club had a number of grounds before settling at Lowerhouse Lane in 1895. The death of the club's secretary, Tom Naughton in 1932, led to the ground on Lowerhouse Lane being renamed Naughton Park as a gesture of the team's appreciation. Naughton Park became one of the best known [[Rugby league playing field|Rugby League grounds]] in the country due to the success of the 'Chemics' in the 1970s, and 1980s. In the 1990s Halton Council in partnership with the Widnes agreed to build a new stadium on the existing site, which would provide a multi-purpose complex including a social club, conference facilities, recreational facilities and catering/function facilities and would be the new home venue for Widnes RLFC. The new stadium was officially opened on 2 November 1997 following the completion of phase 1 of a multimillion-pound redevelopment and was renamed the Halton Community Stadium. On 29 January 1999 Halton Borough Council took over responsibility for the entire stadium, both financially and managerially. This was necessary as the joint venture companies arrangements were not performing as expected. The stadium reached completion with the opening of the East Stand in September 2005 and is an all-seater stadium which has a capacity of 13,500. It has also had the honour to have staged national finals and international fixtures. In August 2011, the stadium turf was removed and replaced with a third generation artificial pitch (or ipitch as it became known), in order to improve overall match performance and maximize the use of the club's facilities. The stadium's name has changed a number of times due to sponsorship purposes, with the latest name being the Select Security Stadium.\n\n==Club coaches, captains and vice captains==\n\n{{see also|List of Widnes Vikings coaches}}\n\n===Coaching register - since 1972===\n{{col-begin-small}}\n\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Vince Karalius''' (Jan 1972 - May 1975)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Frank Myler''' (May 1975 - May 1978)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Doug Laughton''' (May 1978 - Mar 1983)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Harry Dawson & Colin Tyrer''' (Mar 1983 - May 1983)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Vince Karalius & Harry Dawson'''(May 1983-May 1984)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Eric Hughes''' (Jun 1984 - Jan 1986)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Doug Laughton''' (Jan 1986 - May 1991)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Frank Myler''' (Jun 1991 - May 1992)\n\n{{col-3}} \n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Phil Larder''' (May 1992 - May 1994)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Tony Myler''' (May 1994 - Aug 1995)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Doug Laughton''' (Aug 1995 - Aug 1996)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Bernard Long''' (Aug 1996 - May 1997)\n*{{flagicon|NZL}} '''Graeme West''' (May 1997 - Aug 1998)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Colin Whitfield''' (Aug 1998 - Mar 2000)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''David Hulme''' (Mar 2000 - Mar 2001)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Neil Kelly''' (Mar 2001 - Jul 2004)\n\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Stuart Spruce''' (Jul 2004 - Oct 2004)\n*{{flagicon|NZL}} '''Frank Endacott''' (Oct 2004 - Oct 2005)\n*{{flagicon|SCO}} '''Steve McCormack''' (Oct 2005 - Feb 2009)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''John Stankevitch''' (Feb 2009 - Mar 2009)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Paul Cullen''' (Mar 2009 - Nov 2010)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Denis Betts''' (Nov 2010 \u2013 May 2018)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Francis Cummins''' (May 2018 - Oct 2018)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Keiron Purtill''' (Nov 2018 \u2013 Oct2019)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} '''Tim Sheens''' (Oct 2019 \u2013 present)\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Captain register - since 2005===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!width=2%|Year\n!width=1%|\n!width=5%|Captain\n!width=1%|\n!width=5%|Vice Captain\n!width=10%|League\n|-\n|2005\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Terry O'Connor (rugby league)|Terry O'Connor]]\n||{{flagicon|AUS}}\n||[[Shane Millard]]\n|[[Super League X]]\n|-\n|2006\n||{{flagicon|ENG}}\n||[[Mark Smith (rugby league)|Mark Smith]]\n|[[RFL Championship|National League One]]\n|-\n|2007\n|rowspan=4|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=4|[[Mark Smith (rugby league)|Mark Smith]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|IRE|rugby league}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Bob Beswick]]\n|[[RFL Championship|National League One]]\n|-\n|2008\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2009\n|align=center|{{flagicon|AUS}}\n||[[Jim Gannon (rugby league)|Jim Gannon]]\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2010\n|align=center|{{flagicon|IRE|rugby league}}\n||[[David Allen (rugby league)|Dave Allen]]\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2011\n|align=center|{{flagicon|IRE|rugby league}}\n||[[Simon Finnigan]]\n|align=center|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n||[[Chaz I'Anson]]\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2012\n|rowspan=3|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=3|[[Jon Clarke (rugby league)|Jon Clarke]]\n||{{flagicon|ENG}}\n||[[Shaun Briscoe]]\n|[[Super League XVII]]\n|-\n|2013\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Kevin Brown (English rugby league)|Kevin Brown]]\n|[[Super League XVIII]]\n|-\n|2014\n|[[Super League XIX]]\n|-\n|2015\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Kevin Brown (English rugby league)|Kevin Brown]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Joe Mellor]]\n|[[Super League XX]]\n|-\n|2016\n|[[Super League XIX]]\n|-\n|2017\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Joe Mellor]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|AUS}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Rhys Hanbury]]\n|[[Super League XXII]]\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Super League XXIII]]\n|-\n|2019\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|NZL}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Hep Cahill]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|NZL}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Anthony Gelling]]\n|[[Betfred Championship]]\n|}\n\n==2020 squad==\n''* Announced on 21 December 2019''\n\n{{Rls\n|squadname=2020 Widnes Vikings Squad\n|BC1=white;

Jerseys===\nPrior to the over-commercialization of the sport and the changing of kit design on a yearly basis, Widnes traditionally wore a black and white hooped jersey with white shorts. However, throughout there most dominant period of the 1970s, the club actually wore an all white jersey with 3/4 length sleeves and black shorts. It is quite common for fans to desire the club to return to one of these two jerseys. In addition, historically the club played in red when away from home.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Cheshire}}\n* [http://www.widnesvikings.co.uk Official site]\n* [http://www.rugby.widnes.tv Widnes RLFC History Site]\n* [http://ga.oh-servers.com/forum/ Widnes Vikings Supporters Trust forum]\n* [http://forums.rlfans.com/viewforum.php?f=35 Widnes Vikings forum on rlfans.com]\n* [http://www.rugbyleaguechampionships.co.uk/ Championships website]\n* [http://www.rugbyleague.org/index.php?showforum=32/ Widnes Vikings Fans Forums \u2013 RugbyLeague.org]\n* [http://www.stobartstadiumhalton.org.uk/ Stobart Stadium Halton]\n\n{{Widnes Vikings}}\n{{Super League Europe}}\n{{NRFL}}\n{{RFL Championship}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Widnes Vikings| ]]\n[[Category:Rugby clubs established in 1875]]\n[[Category:Super League teams]]\n[[Category:1875 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|The Chemics||Chemic (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|English rugby league football club}}\n{{Infobox rugby league club\n  | clubname               = Widnes Vikings\n  | image                  = [[File:Widnes Vikings logo.svg|150px]]\n  | fullname               = Widnes Vikings Rugby League Football Club\n  | nickname               = The Chemics<br />The Vikings\n  | short name             = Widnes Vikings\n  | founded                = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1875}}\n  | colours                = {{leagueicon|widnes|size=18}} White and Black\n  | web                    = [http://www.widnesvikings.co.uk/ widnesvikings.co.uk]\n  | ground                 = [[Halton Stadium]]<br>[[Widnes]], [[Cheshire]]\n  | capacity               = 13,350\n  | chairman               =Chris Price {{disambiguation needed|date=January 2020}}\n  | coach                  = [[Tim Sheens]]\n  | captain                = [[Jack Owens (rugby league)|Jack Owens]]\n  | league                 = [[Betfred Championship]]\n  | season                 = [[RFL Championship|2019 season]]\n  | position               = 11th\n  | current                = 2019 RFL Championship\n  |cup1                    = [[Rugby Football League Championship|Championships]]\n  | cup1titles             = 3\n  |cup1years               = [[1977\u201378 Northern Rugby Football League season|1978]], [[1987\u201388 Rugby Football League season|1988]], [[1988\u201389 Rugby Football League season|1989]]\n  |cup2                    = [[Challenge Cup]]s\n  | cup2titles             = 7\n  |cup2years               = [[1929\u201330 Northern Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1930]], [[1936\u201337 Northern Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1937]], [[1963\u201364 Northern Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1964]], [[1975 Challenge Cup|1975]], [[1978\u201379 Northern Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1979]], [[1981 Challenge Cup|1981]], [[1984 Challenge Cup|1984]]\n  |cup4                    = '''Other top-tier honours'''<ref>https://widnesvikings.co.uk/about-us/</ref>\n  | cup4titles             = [[#Honours|20]]\n  | cap                    = 591\n  | mostcap                = [[Keith Elwell]]\n  | points                 = 2,195\n  | mostpoints             = [[Ray Dutton]]\n| pattern_la1 = _black_hoops\n| pattern_b1  = _blackhoops \n| pattern_ra1 = _black_hoops\n| pattern_sh1 = _whitesides \n| pattern_so1 = _hoops_black\n| leftarm1    = ffffff\n| body1       = ffffff\n| rightarm1  =  ffffff\n| shorts1     = 000000\n| socks1      = ffffff\n| pattern_la2 = _whiteborder\n| pattern_b2  = _thinwhitesides \n| pattern_ra2 = _whiteborder\n| pattern_sh2 = _whitesides \n| pattern_so2 = \n| leftarm2    = ff0000\n| body2       = ff0000\n| rightarm2  =  ff0000\n| shorts2     = ff0000\n| socks2      = ff0000\n}}\n\nThe '''Widnes Vikings''' are an English professional [[rugby league]] club based in [[Widnes]], [[Cheshire]] that plays in the [[Betfred Championship]]. The club plays its home matches at the [[Halton Stadium]]. Founded as Widnes Football Club, they are one of the original twenty-two rugby clubs that formed the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] in 1895, making them one of the world's first rugby league teams. Their historic nickname is \"The Chemics\" after the main industry in Widnes, but now they use their modern nickname, \"The Vikings\".\n\nThe club enjoyed a period of success in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, and were frequently described as \"Cup Kings\" reaching the [[Challenge Cup]] Final 7 times in 10 years between 1975 and 1984. In 1989, after winning their third [[Rugby League Premiership]], Widnes became the first official [[World Club Challenge|World Club Champions]] by beating the Australian champions [[Canberra Raiders]] 30-18 at [[Old Trafford]]. They have a strong local rivalry with [[Warrington Wolves]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n[[File:F&A Guardian 1875 extract.jpg|thumb|left|A newspaper extract from the Widnes Guardian in 1875 announcing the formation of Farnworth & Appleton Football Club.|alt=A newspaper extract from the Farnworth & Appleton Guardian in 1875 announcing the formation of Farnworth & Appleton Football Club.]]\nThe Farnworth & Appleton Cricket Club was formed in 1871 and four years later the members decided to embrace the burgeoning football code. At their fourth annual evening party in the Drill Hall, Widnes, in November 1875, club Chairman Henry Lea \"gave a short account of the club since it commenced about four years ago, and indicated that they had now started a football club in connexion (sic) with it, and hoped all would join\". The first known game for the new Farnworth and Appleton FC was in Widnes in January 1876 played under rugby rules against Northwich Victoria. A few weeks later a return match was played at Drill Field, Northwich under soccer rules. Vics won both games. These are the only two known fixtures in that truncated first season.\n\nBy May 1876 the club had changed its name to Widnes FC and the cricket side of the organisation had disbanded, presumably to concentrate on football activities. By the late 1870s the club was being referred to as \"The Chemicals\"\u2014subsequently shortened to 'The Chemics'.\n\nThe first ground was on Albert Road behind what is now the Premier Wetherspoon's pub and a short spell followed in the Simms Cross area. From around 1878\u201384 the club were based at the junction of Millfield/Peelhouse Lane, apart from season 1880\u201381 when they played on the Widnes Cricket Club ground at Lowerhouse Lane. From 1884\u201395 they rented a field at Lowerhouse Lane before moving to their third separate site on that road in October 1895. The first ever game at what later became [[Halton Stadium|Naughton Park]] was against Liversedge on Saturday 12 October 1895.\n\nIn 1895, Widnes were founder members of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] which broke away from the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Their first game was an away fixture against Runcorn which they lost 15\u20134. During the early years, the club often had to sell players to balance the books. The strength of junior rugby league in the area meant the club had a steady stream of new players to offset any losses.\n\nIn 1902, the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues were combined to form a second division, Widnes was added to the first division.\n\nIn 1914, [[Arthur Johnson (rugby league)|Arthur 'Chick' Johnson]] was capped for the Lions (captained by Harold Wagstaff) in the famous [[Rorke's Drift test]], a match in which they overcame all the odds, and injuries to beat Australia with a depleted side of 10 against 13. He scored an extraordinary try to win the game, dribbling the ball from inside his own half. Widnes closed for the 1915-16 season but recommenced playing in 1916 following the introduction of conscription which meant that would not be accused of keeping men from volunteering for the First World War. Thirteen Widnes players were killed during the conflict.\n\nThe club's first ever success came when they won the Lancashire League trophy in the 1919\u201320 season. However, the 1920s saw the club almost go to the wall. Local rivals Warrington donated their share of the traditional Easter and Christmas [[derby match]]es to keep Widnes afloat in 1927\u201328.\n\nIn 1930, Widnes with 12 local-born players defied the odds to beat [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] 10\u20133 to bring home the [[Challenge Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_league/ray_french/2949991.stm |title= Widnes Field 12 Local Players - 1930 Challenge Cup Final |accessdate=2003-04-23 |publisher=BBC | date=24 April 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingsway housing scheme threatened the loss of Widnes' ground. After several years of fundraising during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, \u00a33,250 was raised to save the ground. This came with a stipulation that the ground could be sold only to the local council at the original price. The newly named [[Halton Stadium|Naughton Park]] was opened in 1932.\n\nA major boost for the club was Widnes' first ever trip to the Challenge Cup final, staged at Wembley. Their opponents were [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], Saints scored after six minutes to take a 3\u20130 lead, but Widnes hit back with a penalty try, a further try and a penalty to take a 10\u20133 half-time lead. A scoreless second half meant Widnes had won the cup.\n\nWidnes became the first club to make two trips to Wembley, with a loss to [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] in the 1934 cup final.\n\nIn 1935\u201336, the team came close to being rugby league champions. Having finished third in the table, Widnes beat Liverpool 10\u20139 but lost to [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]], in the championship final. A third trip to Wembley came in 1937, with an 18\u20135 win over [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]]. The final was dubbed \"McCue's Match\" as the halfback played an important part in the win.\n\nWidnes dropped out of the wartime Lancashire league in 1940\u201341 and did not return to league competition until 1945\u201346.\n\n===Post war===\n\nTommy McCue led the club to its first ever [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] win, with a 7\u20133 victory against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in 1945.\n\nBack at Wembley in 1950, the team was beaten 19\u20130 by [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]]. During this period, the club reverted to selling its players to richer teams.\n\nLocal man [[Vince Karalius]] joined Widnes from St. Helens in 1962 and was appointed club captain. In his first season, Widnes finished third in the Championship, which equalled the club's best league placing. In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Widnes and [[Workington Town]] met at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], [[Wigan]], in the first final of the [[Rugby league county leagues|Western Division]] Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962. With two minutes remaining, Lowdon dropped a goal to earn Workington a 9\u20139 draw. Later in the month [[Workington Town]] won the replay 10\u20130.\n\nThe following season saw him lead his team to Wembley, where Widnes were Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] winners after they defeated [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] 13\u20135. No team had ever played more games in reaching Wembley than Widnes in 1964. In the first round, two replays were necessary before beating [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]. [[Liverpool Stanley|Liverpool City]] were beaten in the second round, then Widnes played [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]] in front of 19,000 at Naughton Park. A 5\u20135 draw meant another replay, which was a scoreless draw at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]]. A second replay at Wigan was watched by 21,369 with Widnes winning 15\u20133. The semi-final against [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]] was drawn 7\u20137. A crowd of 28,732 spectators watched the replay, which Widnes won. A Wembley crowd of 84,488 saw Widnes win the Challenge Cup for the third time with a 13\u20135 victory over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. This was the Chemics first trophy success in eighteen years.''\n\n===The ''\"Cup Kings\"''===\nThe 1970s saw the first really outstanding Widnes team. A host of young local players developed into the \"Cup Kings\", a golden age for the club. The first cup-final was a loss in the 1971\u201372 [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]].\n\nSix years after he retired from playing [[Vince Karalius]] returned to Widnes as coach; appointed in January 1972. The following two seasons, Widnes reached the finals of the [[BBC2 Floodlit Trophy]]. The first success came in the 1975 Lancashire Cup which Widnes won by beating [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] that season. They also won the 1975 Challenge Cup final 14\u20137 versus Warrington at Wembley. This was the first time in their history that Widnes had won two trophies in the same season. At his zenith, Karalius, stepped down once from his role as coach. He was replaced in May 1975 by [[Frank Myler]].\n\nWidnes visited Wembley in the following two seasons, losing to [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] and then [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. However, this was made up for by victories in the [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] and [[John Player Trophy]]. The season after this (1977\u201378) saw their first league championship. The team went through the season unbeaten at home in the league. There were also trips to the John Player and Premiership finals.\n\n[[Keith Elwell]] began his run of 242 consecutive appearances at Wembley in the [[1976\u201377 Northern Rugby Football League season|1976\u201377]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final, including two as a substitute. He finished his run at [[Hull F.C.]] on 26 September 1982. This record for consecutive appearances for one club stands to this day.\n\n[[Doug Laughton]] took over the job of team coach when Frank Myler retired from the position in 1978. The 1978\u201379 season saw no less than four cups come to Widnes\u2014the BBC2 floodlit trophy, Lancashire Cup, Premiership and a win at Wembley over [[Wakefield Trinity]] in front of a crowd of 93,218. Widnes also defeated the [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes]]-winning [[1978 Kangaroo tour]]ists.\n\nThe 1979\u201380 season saw Widnes beat [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] in the Premiership final, but come second to them in the league and John Player Trophy. The Lancashire Cup was won for the fifth time in the 1970s.\n\nThe 1980s started with a Wembley win over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] in 1980\u201381. The season after this, Widnes again returned to Wembley, to face [[Hull F.C.]] Widnes led 14\u20136 with less than 20 minutes to go, but the game finished 14\u201314 and Hull won the replay 18\u20139 at [[Elland Road]], [[Leeds United FC|Leeds]]. Widnes kept their record of winning a cup every season by defeating Hull 23\u20138 in the Premiership final. The next season saw Hull again beaten by Widnes in the Premiership final.\n\n[[Vince Karalius]] returned to the club in March 1983 as co-coach with Harry Dawson. Dawson quit as coach in March 1984 with Karalius continuing as team manager. Karalius led a strong Widnes side to the finals of the Lancashire Cup and John Player Trophy and another Wembley victory appearance 19\u20136 against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]].\n\n[[Doug Laughton]] returned to the club in January 1986 and began a series of signings of players from other league clubs and from rugby union. One such player was [[Martin Offiah]], who in 1987\u201388 scored a club record 42 tries. The team went on to win the championship that season, clinching it with a 50-point win away over [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]]. Widnes then beat St. Helens in the Premiership Final at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]] a game in which [[Alan Tait]] made his d\u00e9but.\n\nThe 1988\u201389 season saw the club sign rugby union star [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] from [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] for \u00a3225,000. Wigan were beaten in the Charity Shield but had their revenge in the Regal Trophy Final. The Championship came down to the last game of the season, a capacity crowd at Naughton Park saw Widnes beat Wigan 32\u201318 to win the title for the second year running. The Premiership was won again, with over 40,000 at Old Trafford to see Widnes beat Hull 18\u201310.\n\nThe 1989\u201390 season saw Widnes play at [[Anfield]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beating Wigan 27\u201322. A trip to France to play Le Pontet saw Widnes chosen as the [[Northern Hemisphere]] representatives to meet Australia's Grand Final winners. [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] took a 12\u20130 lead but were then swept aside as Widnes stormed home 30\u201318 to become the [[1989 World Club Challenge|first official World Club Champions]].\n\nHowever, financial problems riddled the club in the early 1990s. To balance the books, over 25 first team players were sold to other teams. This resulted in the club sinking to 12th in the division one table, avoiding relegation.\n\nMyler became coach of Widnes in May 1994. In August 1995 the club decided to bring back [[Doug Laughton]] for a third stint as team manager which resulted in Myler's sacking as coach.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Widnes sack coach Tony Myler | work = Independent, The | place = | pages = | language = | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 1995-08-12 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/widnes-sack-coach-tony-myler-1595927.html | accessdate = 2009-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Summer era===\nIn 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural [[Super League]] season and changed from a winter to a summer season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/rugbys-pounds-87m-deal-gives-murdoch-transfer-veto-1526582.html |title=Rugby's pounds 87m deal gives Murdoch transfer veto |accessdate=9 December 2009 |publisher=Runcorn and Widnes World| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mhXzhohx | archivedate= 2010-01-11 | location=London | first=Dave | last=Hadfield | date=20 December 1995}}</ref> When the RFL announced that a new 12-team Super League was to be formed a chaotic period ensued in which the club was out, then in, then out, then in merged with local rivals Warrington and then finally out again as they finished below the cut-off point of 10th in the existing top flight.\n\nThe club adopted the name ''Widnes Vikings'' on 27 November 1996; the club had originally intended to adopt the moniker 'Warriors' but were asked to reconsider by the RFL, as Whitehaven were planning to adopt this name also. Further player and coaching departures ensued and the club struggled in the new first division, the club's first ever finish in the relegation zone followed. They spent the next five years in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]].\n\n[[Graeme West]] took over as coach after [[Doug Laughton]]'s third stint, his reign lasted from May 1997 until August 1998. During this time, the playing arena was rebuilt and the old stands, terraces and facilities were demolished to be replaced with a state-of-the-art all-seater stadium and was also renamed from Naughton Park to the Halton Community Stadium. West was later replaced as coach by [[Colin Whitfield]].\n\nIn 1999 Widnes narrowly missed out on a place in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] Grand Final. The 2000 season was one of transition with head coach Colin Whitfield being sacked and replaced by [[David Hulme (rugby league)|David Hulme]]. A record attendance for the newly rebuilt stadium was set at 6,644 for a Northern Ford Premiership game against [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] on [[Boxing Day]] 2000. Widnes finished off a poor season in 8th place in the NFP.\n\nUnder new coach [[Neil Kelly]], Widnes won promotion to [[Super League]] in 2001 after beating [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 24\u201312 in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] Grand Final.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/3009731/Cantillon-sees-Widnes-to-brink-of-elite.html |title= Cantillon sees Widnes to brink of elite |accessdate=2001-07-28 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5mgLXtl9w | archivedate= 2010-01-10 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Crossley | date=28 July 2001}}</ref>\n\nTheir d\u00e9but season in the [[Super League]] was in 2002, and the Vikings surprised everyone by narrowly missing out on a play-off place, and finishing seventh.\n\nThe following season saw them consolidate with a 9th place finish, and in 2004 they avoided relegation on the final day of the season, with [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford's]] defeat by [[Wakefield Trinity]] saving Widnes' fate. [[Stuart Spruce]] was caretaker manager.\n\n[[Frank Endacott]] arrived at Widnes as coach in 2005, but could not improve on the previous seasons. With two teams being relegated in 2005, due to the inclusion of [[Catalans Dragons]] in Superleague from 2006 onwards, Widnes were relegated back down to the second tier of the English game (LHF National League 1).\n\nWidnes parted company with coach Frank Endacott, and new coach [[Steve McCormack]] rebuilt the squad, which notably included Australian full back [[David Peachey]], who kept his word to join the club, despite its relegation.\n\n[[Stephen Vaughan, Sr.|Stephen Vaughan]] completed a take-over of Widnes in 2006<ref>[http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-city-fc/chester-city-fc-news/tm_objectid=16885355&method=full&siteid=50020&headline=vaughan-in-new-pledge-name_page.html Vaughan in new pledge] ''Chester Chronicle''. 31-05-06.

A nine-point deduction for going into administration was successfully neutralised through winning their first three games, and Widnes qualified for the [[RFL Championship|National League One]] Playoffs by finishing in sixth place. A 32-16 defeat by third-placed [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] however brought the nostalgic 2008 campaign to an end.\n  \nOff the field, Widnes had applied for a [[Super League]] licence for the 2009 season along with 18 other clubs.

The club also reached the 2010 [[Co-operative Championship]] playoffs but were knocked out in the opening round by [[Barrow Raiders]].\n\n===Return to Super League===\nIn 2011 Widnes were granted a [[Super League]] licence for the 2012-14 seasons and [[Denis Betts]] was confirmed as the man who would coach the club. A flourish of new signings were announced and the pioneering 'Viking Stronghold' initiative moved from strength to strength. Widnes also installed a fourth generation artificial pitch (or ipitch as it became known) during the off season, making them the first team in modern day rugby league to not play on a traditional grass pitch. Widnes' tenancy in the [[Co-operative Championship]] culminated in September 2011 with a fifth place league finish, and a first round playoff defeat of 36-20 by [[Sheffield Eagles]] at [[Bramall Lane]].\n\nFebruary 2012 saw Widnes' re-emergence into the top tier of rugby league, and they claimed their first two points against [[Wigan Warriors]]  in a 37-36 win. The club managed to prove a number of critics wrong by gaining 12 points in total by the end of their first season back, but this was not enough to prevent the club from finishing at the bottom of the [[Super League]] table.\n\nThe 2013 season saw a marked improvement on the field by Widnes, with the team earning a total of 22 league points and finishing 10th in the [[Super League]] table.\n\nThe 2014 season proved to be the most successful season of the franchise period, with the club finishing eighth in the [[Super League]] table on 27 points  and subsequently qualifying for the end of season play-offs for the first time in their history. A 22-19 away defeat by the [[Warrington Wolves]] brought the curtain down on a season that can only be seen as a success for the Vikings, with a [[Challenge Cup]] Semi-Final appearance against the [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]] being the key highlight. However, it was also during the 2014 season that the club received the news that \"legendary supporter\" <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.widnesvikings.co.uk/article/39706/pat-price.stm|title=Pat Price 1937-2014|accessdate=2014-07-12 |publisher=Widnes Vikings | date=12 July 2014 }}</ref> Pat Price had died and condolences for 'the first lady of Rugby League' were received from clubs and supporters throughout the sport.\n\nThe RFL overhauled [[Super League]] for the 2015 season, scrapping the Franchise System <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/28464023}}</ref> and re-adopted promotion & relegation. Widnes finished in 9th position on 19 points, and then went on to consolidate their [[Super League]] status in the Middle 8's.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/rugby-league/news/article/480/9927945/super-8s-qualifiers-championship-shield-fixtures-schedule-results}}</ref>\n\nThe 2016 season saw the Vikings put together a number of early exciting performances, including defeating the previous season's champions Leeds Rhinos 56-12. This placed Widnes top of the Super League table, heading into the Easter fixtures. Before the start of the 2017 Widnes sold their inspirational captain and best player to their bitter rivals Warrington Wolves. This move was completed whilst Brown was still in contract and despite warnings from fans was the beginning of the end for Widnes as a potential mid table team.\n\nIn 2017 the team finished bottom but avoided relegation by beating Catalans Dragons and the Million Pound Game.\nThe lack of ambition of the club was now available for everybody to see with Chairman Steven O\u2019Connor washing his hands of the club and moving to Australia in order to pursue further business projects. This was done without O\u2019Connor fulfilling his promise to the club and town that the club would not be entering Super League to \u201cMake up the numbers\u201d. The current board headed by James Rule failed to heed the mistakes of the 2017 season and further recruitment to the squad was extremely poor. This lack of ambition and value for money has resulted in fans walking away from the club in their droves.\n\n===Vikings Resurgence===\nIn March 2019 after narrowly escaping liquidation, Thanks in large part to crowdfunding pages setup by the remaining Widnes Vikings fans.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/fundraising-widnes-vikings-approaches-50000-15881346 |title=Widnes Vikings: Fundraising for Widnes Vikings approaches \u00a350,000 in bid to stave off liquidation threat |work=Cheshire Live|date= 25 February 2019 |accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> Newly appointed Head Coach Kieron Purtill has been leading the boys in a moderately successful streak of wins, culminating in reaching the finals of the [[2019 RFL 1895 Cup]] against [[Sheffield Eagles]].\n\n==Relegation and financial problems==\nThe 2018 season continued as the previous one with few quality signings and a team no longer good enough to compete in Super League. The club lost nineteen games in a row, which led to coach Denis Betts being dismissed with Francis Cummins taking interim charge; however, he could not prevent the club from falling into the Championship. On 1 February 2019, CEO James Rule resigned because the club faced significant financial challenges as a result of relegation. Speculation about the future of the club began to mount following a significant silence by the club's then chairman, Steve O\u2019Connor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.runcornandwidnesworld.co.uk/sport/17403827.james-rule-gives-an-update-as-he-steps-down-at-widnes-vikings/|title=James Rule gives an update as he steps down at Widnes Vikings|website=Runcorn and Widnes World}}</ref>\n\nThe club went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] on 22 February 2019 after a take-over bid failed; as a result of this development the [[Rugby Football League]] imposed a 12-point penalty on the club and their upcoming game against Sheffield was postponed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/47323878 |title=Widnes Vikings go into administration and are deducted 12 points by RFL |work=BBC Sport|date=22 February 2019 |accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> Following a fundraising campaign, supported by fans and other rugby league clubs, over \u00a3100,000 was raised.

The club had a number of grounds before settling at Lowerhouse Lane in 1895. The death of the club's secretary, Tom Naughton in 1932, led to the ground on Lowerhouse Lane being renamed Naughton Park as a gesture of the team's appreciation. Naughton Park became one of the best known [[Rugby league playing field|Rugby League grounds]] in the country due to the success of the 'Chemics' in the 1970s, and 1980s. In the 1990s Halton Council in partnership with the Widnes agreed to build a new stadium on the existing site, which would provide a multi-purpose complex including a social club, conference facilities, recreational facilities and catering/function facilities and would be the new home venue for Widnes RLFC. The new stadium was officially opened on 2 November 1997 following the completion of phase 1 of a multimillion-pound redevelopment and was renamed the Halton Community Stadium. On 29 January 1999 Halton Borough Council took over responsibility for the entire stadium, both financially and managerially. This was necessary as the joint venture companies arrangements were not performing as expected. The stadium reached completion with the opening of the East Stand in September 2005 and is an all-seater stadium which has a capacity of 13,500. It has also had the honour to have staged national finals and international fixtures. In August 2011, the stadium turf was removed and replaced with a third generation artificial pitch (or ipitch as it became known), in order to improve overall match performance and maximize the use of the club's facilities. The stadium's name has changed a number of times due to sponsorship purposes, with the latest name being the Select Security Stadium.\n\n==Club coaches, captains and vice captains==\n\n{{see also|List of Widnes Vikings coaches}}\n\n===Coaching register - since 1972===\n{{col-begin-small}}\n\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Vince Karalius''' (Jan 1972 - May 1975)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Frank Myler''' (May 1975 - May 1978)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Doug Laughton''' (May 1978 - Mar 1983)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Harry Dawson & Colin Tyrer''' (Mar 1983 - May 1983)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Vince Karalius & Harry Dawson'''(May 1983-May 1984)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Eric Hughes''' (Jun 1984 - Jan 1986)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Doug Laughton''' (Jan 1986 - May 1991)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Frank Myler''' (Jun 1991 - May 1992)\n\n{{col-3}} \n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Phil Larder''' (May 1992 - May 1994)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Tony Myler''' (May 1994 - Aug 1995)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Doug Laughton''' (Aug 1995 - Aug 1996)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Bernard Long''' (Aug 1996 - May 1997)\n*{{flagicon|NZL}} '''Graeme West''' (May 1997 - Aug 1998)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Colin Whitfield''' (Aug 1998 - Mar 2000)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''David Hulme''' (Mar 2000 - Mar 2001)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Neil Kelly''' (Mar 2001 - Jul 2004)\n\n{{col-3}}\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Stuart Spruce''' (Jul 2004 - Oct 2004)\n*{{flagicon|NZL}} '''Frank Endacott''' (Oct 2004 - Oct 2005)\n*{{flagicon|SCO}} '''Steve McCormack''' (Oct 2005 - Feb 2009)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''John Stankevitch''' (Feb 2009 - Mar 2009)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Paul Cullen''' (Mar 2009 - Nov 2010)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Denis Betts''' (Nov 2010 \u2013 May 2018)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Francis Cummins''' (May 2018 - Oct 2018)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} '''Keiron Purtill''' (Nov 2018 \u2013 Oct2019)\n*{{flagicon|AUS}} '''Tim Sheens''' (Oct 2019 \u2013 present)\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Captain register - since 2005===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!width=2%|Year\n!width=1%|\n!width=5%|Captain\n!width=1%|\n!width=5%|Vice Captain\n!width=10%|League\n|-\n|2005\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Terry O'Connor (rugby league)|Terry O'Connor]]\n||{{flagicon|AUS}}\n||[[Shane Millard]]\n|[[Super League X]]\n|-\n|2006\n||{{flagicon|ENG}}\n||[[Mark Smith (rugby league)|Mark Smith]]\n|[[RFL Championship|National League One]]\n|-\n|2007\n|rowspan=4|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=4|[[Mark Smith (rugby league)|Mark Smith]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|IRE|rugby league}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Bob Beswick]]\n|[[RFL Championship|National League One]]\n|-\n|2008\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2009\n|align=center|{{flagicon|AUS}}\n||[[Jim Gannon (rugby league)|Jim Gannon]]\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2010\n|align=center|{{flagicon|IRE|rugby league}}\n||[[David Allen (rugby league)|Dave Allen]]\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2011\n|align=center|{{flagicon|IRE|rugby league}}\n||[[Simon Finnigan]]\n|align=center|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n||[[Chaz I'Anson]]\n|[[Co-operative Championship]]\n|-\n|2012\n|rowspan=3|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=3|[[Jon Clarke (rugby league)|Jon Clarke]]\n||{{flagicon|ENG}}\n||[[Shaun Briscoe]]\n|[[Super League XVII]]\n|-\n|2013\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Kevin Brown (English rugby league)|Kevin Brown]]\n|[[Super League XVIII]]\n|-\n|2014\n|[[Super League XIX]]\n|-\n|2015\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Kevin Brown (English rugby league)|Kevin Brown]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Joe Mellor]]\n|[[Super League XX]]\n|-\n|2016\n|[[Super League XIX]]\n|-\n|2017\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|ENG}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Joe Mellor]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|AUS}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Rhys Hanbury]]\n|[[Super League XXII]]\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Super League XXIII]]\n|-\n|2019\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|NZL}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Hep Cahill]]\n|rowspan=2|{{flagicon|NZL}}\n|rowspan=2|[[Anthony Gelling]]\n|[[Betfred Championship]]\n|}\n\n==2020 squad==\n''* Announced on 21 December 2019''\n\n{{Rls\n|squadname=2020 Widnes Vikings Squad\n|BC1=white;

Jerseys===\nPrior to the over-commercialization of the sport and the changing of kit design on a yearly basis, Widnes traditionally wore a black and white hooped jersey with white shorts. However, throughout there most dominant period of the 1970s, the club actually wore an all white jersey with 3/4 length sleeves and black shorts. It is quite common for fans to desire the club to return to one of these two jerseys. In addition, historically the club played in red when away from home.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Cheshire}}\n* [http://www.widnesvikings.co.uk Official site]\n* [http://www.rugby.widnes.tv Widnes RLFC History Site]\n* [http://ga.oh-servers.com/forum/ Widnes Vikings Supporters Trust forum]\n* [http://forums.rlfans.com/viewforum.php?f=35 Widnes Vikings forum on rlfans.com]\n* [http://www.rugbyleaguechampionships.co.uk/ Championships website]\n* [http://www.rugbyleague.org/index.php?showforum=32/ Widnes Vikings Fans Forums \u2013 RugbyLeague.org]\n* [http://www.stobartstadiumhalton.org.uk/ Stobart Stadium Halton]\n\n{{Widnes Vikings}}\n{{Super League Europe}}\n{{NRFL}}\n{{RFL Championship}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Widnes Vikings| ]]\n[[Category:Rugby clubs established in 1875]]\n[[Category:Super League teams]]\n[[Category:1875 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union]]\n", "name_user": "90.215.175.167", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widnes_Vikings"}

George VI ascended the throne upon the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication of his brother]], [[Edward VIII]], on 11 December 1936, three days before his 41st birthday. Edward's coronation had been planned for 12 May 1937 and it was decided to continue with his brother and sister-in-law's coronation on the same date.\n\nAlthough the music included a range of new anthems and the ceremony underwent some alterations to include the [[Dominion]]s, it remained a largely conservative affair and closely followed the ceremonial of George V's coronation in 1911. The ceremony began with the [[anointing]] of the King, symbolising his spiritual entry into kingship, and then his [[Crown (headgear)|crowning]] and enthronement, representing his assumption of temporal powers and responsibilities. The peers of the realm then [[Homage (feudal)|paid homage]] to the King before a shorter and simpler ceremony was conducted for the Queen's coronation. The return procession to [[Buckingham Palace]] was over {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} in length, making it the longest coronation procession up to that time; crowds of people lined the streets to watch it, over 32,000 soldiers took part and 20,000 police officers lined the route. The coronation was commemorated by the issuing of official [[King George VI Coronation Medal|medals]], coinage, and stamps, by military parades across the Empire, and by numerous unofficial celebrations, including street parties and the production of memorabilia.\n\nThe event was designed to be not only a sacred anointing and formal crowning, but also a public spectacle, which was also planned as a display of the British Empire. May 1937 included a programme of royal events lasting nearly the entire month to commemorate and mark the occasion. As a preliminary to the coronation, guests from across the Empire and around the world assembled at Buckingham Palace and official receptions were held to welcome them; amongst those attending were [[India]]n princes and, for the first time, native [[Africa]]n royalty. For the event itself, the [[prime minister]]s of each Dominion took part in the procession to the abbey, while representatives of nearly every country attended. Contingents from most colonies and each Dominion participated in the return procession through [[London]]'s streets.\n\nThe media played an important part in broadcasting this show of pageantry and imperialism to the Empire. The coronation was an important event in the [[history of television]], being the country's first major [[outside broadcast]], although television cameras were not allowed inside the abbey. It was also the first coronation to be filmed, as well as the first to be broadcast on radio.\n\n==Background==\n===Accession===\n{{Further|Succession to the British throne|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}\n[[File:Tumbler, coronation (AM 10638-2).jpg|thumb|right|A commemorative [[Tumbler (glass)|glass tumbler]], produced for the coronation of King Edward VIII, planned for 12 May 1937.]]\nIn January 1936, King [[George V]] died and his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]], succeeded him as king-emperor of the British Empire. He was unmarried at that time, but the American socialite, [[Wallis Simpson]], had accompanied him on numerous social occasions in years leading up to 1936; she was married to the shipping executive [[Ernest Aldrich Simpson]] and had previously been divorced. The relationship had not been reported in the British press, but was receiving considerable media attention in the United States; it was controversial due to her being divorced, a status considered incompatible with the King's position as the nominal head of the [[Church of England]], which did not at that time permit remarriage after divorce.<ref>https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/marriage,-family-and-sexuality-issues/divorce.aspx</ref>\n\nIn October 1936 Simpson filed for divorce, and the King informed the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], that he intended to marry her. Baldwin and several leading imperial administrators advised the King that popular opinion in the dominions was hostile to the proposed marriage; at home, the King also faced opposition from the Church of England and from factions in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The widespread unwillingness to accept Simpson as the King's consort, and Edward's refusal to give her up, led to his abdication in December 1936.<ref>Matthew, \"Edward VIII (later Prince Edward, duke of Windsor) (1894\u20131972)\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004</ref>\n\nHe was succeeded by his next younger brother, [[George VI]]. Before his accession, George had been known as Prince Albert, [[Duke of York]]; his [[regnal name]] was chosen in honour of his late father. In 1923, he had married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the daughter of the [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]].\n\n===Coronation ceremony===\n{{Further|Coronation of the British monarch}}\nAlthough the reign of the British monarch begins on his or her succession to the throne, the coronation service marks their formal investiture. In 1937, the ceremony was organised by a Coronation Committee, established by the [[Privy Council]] and chaired by the [[Lord President of the Council]], a political appointment; its central component, the Executive Committee, was chaired by [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]], who inherited the office of [[Earl Marshal]], which carries with it, by convention, the responsibility for the organisation and coordination of the coronation ceremony.<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 421\">Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 421</ref><ref name=\"Queen Elizabeth pp. 16-17\">''The Coronation Book of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth'', n.d., pp. 16-17</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n===Planning===\nThe Coronation Committee had been delayed when it met for the first time on 24 June 1936: [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the [[Lord President of the Council]], met the Duke of Norfolk to discuss the proceedings; MacDonald would chair the Coronation Committee as a whole, and the Duke would chair the Executive Committee. While Edward VIII was away, cruising on the ''[[Nahlin (yacht)|Nahlin]]'' with Wallis Simpson, his brother, Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI) sat in his place on the committees.<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 421\"/> Edward VIII had initially been reluctant to have a coronation at all (asking the Archbishop of Canterbury whether it could be dispensed with), but conceded that a shorter service would be acceptable; his desire for a lower-key event led to the planned abandonment of the royal procession through London the following day, the thanksgiving service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and the dinner with London dignitaries.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 421\u2013422</ref>\n\nAfter the abdication of Edward VIII, the coronation committee continued to plan the event for George VI with minimal disruption; according to [[Roy Strong|Sir Roy Strong]], at the next meeting after the abdication \"no reference was made at all to the change of sovereign, everything immediately being assumed to have been done for the new king.\"<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 422</ref> After the abdication, though, many of the traditional elements that Edward VIII cared less for were restored, with Queen Mary taking an interest in the design of furniture and insisting on a more traditional appearance; indeed, much of the service and the furnishings were to closely resemble those of the 1911 coronation of George V.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 423</ref>\n\n===Archbishop of Canterbury===\n[[File:AbpCosmoLang.jpg|thumb|right|Archbishop Cosmo Lang, painted in 1937 with his coronation [[cope]] and [[mitre]] by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]].]]\nAlthough the Executive Committee was chaired by the Earl Marshal, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Cosmo Lang]], was also a driving force behind the preparations for the 1937 coronation; and many of the decisions about the order of service were made by or with him. He was an ''ex officio'' member of both the Executive Committee and the Coronation Committee, which dealt with the detail and, as such, he attended all of the rehearsals. He tended to take a leading role in the planning process, becoming a key mediator when queries arose, and dealing with questions of how the service should be broadcast by the media.<ref>Beaken, Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis, 2012, pp. 132\u2013133</ref> Lang also spoke to the nation through the BBC services in the run-up to Coronation Day; he saw the Coronation as an opportunity for the spiritual renewal of the nation, and he organised a campaign of [[evangelism]] called ''Recall to Religion'', which he launched on 27 December 1936 with an address on BBC radio. He was also keen to ensure that the King and Queen understood the religious nuances of the service, and held two meetings with the couple beforehand.<ref name=\"Beaken, 2012, pp. 132\">Beaken, ''Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis'', 2012, pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n\nThe Archbishop met the King and Queen on the evening before their coronation, running through the ceremony and explaining the most important parts. He was also concerned about King George's [[speech impediment|stutter]] and discussed the matter with Lord Dawson of Penn and Lord Wigram; [[Lionel Logue]] was then the King's speech therapist and the Archbishop discussed replacing him, but decided to monitor the King's improvement and Logue remained his therapist. As it happened, the King delivered his speech without stuttering.<ref name=\"Beaken, 2012, pp. 132\"/>\n\n===Construction===\nThe coronation cost \u00a3454,000, which was more than three times the cost of the 1911 ceremony.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 458</ref> This cost included the construction of the annexe, which was built as a temporary add-on at the entrance of the abbey for each coronation. In previous years, it had taken the form of an imitation Gothic entrance, but, as a remnant of Edward VIII's modernising attitude, it was now an [[art-deco]] design, adorned with stylised heraldic beasts and tapestries belonging to [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 8th Duke of Buccleuch|the Duke of Buccleuch]].<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 423, 459\u2013460 and 462</ref> For each coronation, special seating was also constructed to accommodate the large number of guests; 1937 was the first year to make use of metal structures to support the seats, in the form of tubular steel. 400 tons were used alongside {{convert|72,000|ft3|m3|abbr=off|lk=off}} of wood, with 400 men working on the construction. The theatre and [[sacrarium]] were also lowered to floor level for the first time since the restoration{{clarify|date=December 2017}}.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 462\u2013463</ref>\n\n===Imperial considerations===\n[[File:George VI coronation display, Toronto, 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eaton's]] department store window in [[Toronto]] displaying mannequins of George and Elizabeth wearing their crowns and holding orbs]]\n\nIn 1911, standards of the Dominions, autonomous communities of the British Empire, were borne during the procession, but, after the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which established legislative equality between the Dominions and the United Kingdom, the actual service and coronation rite needed to be updated to reflect this change in political power within the Empire. Furthermore, the fact that the service was an Anglican rite excluded other faiths and denominations; in 1937, several Dominions had premiers who were [[Catholic]] and, by that time, laws which previously excluded people from public office on religious grounds had been repealed.<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 442\">Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 442</ref> The Coronation Committee altered the rite to reflect this change; the King now swore to maintain \"the Protestant Reformed Religion only as established by law in the United Kingdom.\"<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 442\"/> During Edward VIII's reign, a committee was established and chaired by the Duke of York to investigate how colonial representatives might be included within the ceremony, but the Committee failed to implement any changes, except to the [[Coronation Oath]]. This was the first amendment to the oath since the coronation of [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] in 1689.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17305392 The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW) \u2013 Saturday 20 February 1937 \u2013 ''CORONATION OATH: FORM ANNOUNCED'']</ref>\n\nAlthough 1937 saw an increase in the colonial contingents partaking in the procession and an official lunch in [[Westminster Hall]] was given to Parliamentary representatives of Empire states for the first time, the service itself was barely altered to reflect the new status of the Dominions.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 443\u2013444</ref>\n\n==Guests==\nThe ceremony was attended by the King's and Queen's daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Princesses Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], as well as by the King's mother, the dowager [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref name=Abbey>{{cite web|title=\"George VI\", Westminster Abbey (official website)|website=westminster-abbey.org|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/royals/george-vi/|accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref> Members of the extended Royal Family attended and all peers and members of parliament were invited.

Then, Queen Mary's Lord Chamberlain ([[Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey|the Marquess of Anglesey]]) led Queen Mary, whose train was borne by four pages (the Earl of Dalkeith, the Marquess of Lansdowne, Gerald Lascelles, and Viscount Errington) and who was attended by the Mistress of the Robes (the Duchess of Devonshire), two ladies of the bedchamber in waiting, her private secretary, comptroller, and three equerries (two ordinary and one extra).<ref name=\"LG-7044-5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34453/supplement/7044/ |title=''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937 issue no. 34453, pp. 7044\u201345 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the King and Queen===\nA guard of honour had formed at the vestibule and at the entrance, and the King and Queen arrived at 11:00. On their entry, they were greeted by the Great Officers of State, the Archbishops, and the peers bearing the regalia. They then formed their procession, which was led by the King's Chaplain and the Chapter at Westminster, who were followed by representatives of the Free Churches and the Church of Scotland. The procession involved all of the Great Officers of State, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Lord Mayor of London, the Officers of Arms of England and Scotland, the Standards of each Dominion, the Prime Ministers of the UK and of each of the Dominions, and the most senior and highest-ranking officials in the Royal Household. They were followed by twelve members of the Yeoman of the Guard and six of its officials. The King and Queen walked surrounded by their regalia, borne by the designated peers; King George wore his great robes of state, which had to be carried by nine pages. They walked past the choir, in which sat the foreign representatives and delegates, before passing through the screen; after this, they sat or stood in their designated area and the King and Queen took their seats in the Chairs of State in front of the royal box. As the King and Queen and the procession proceeded, the choir sang ''[[I was glad]]'' with the traditional acclamations of ''Vivat Regina Elizabetha'' and ''Vivat Rex Georgius'' by the [[King's Scholar (Westminster School)|King's Scholar]]s of [[Westminster School]].\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Coronation of George VI 1937.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the coronation service by [[Henry Charles Brewer]] (1866 \u2013 1943) and published in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''.]] \nThe coronation service itself began once the procession into the abbey was over and the King and Queen were seated. Beginning with the recognition, the King then took an oath and was anointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, before being crowned king. As a remnant of the coronation ceremony's feudal origins, the King then received homage from the peers and peeresses of the realm in attendance.\n\nThere were few departures from the services conducted at previous coronations. Efforts were made to shorten the lengthy proceedings: the [[litany]] was sung during the regalia procession before the start of the service, and the [[sermon]] was omitted entirely.<ref>Range, ''Music and Ceremonial at British Coronations: From James I to Elizabeth II'', 2003, p. 243</ref> Even so, the service itself lasted for two and a half hours,<ref>Lacey, ''Monarch: The Life and Reign of Elizabeth II'', p. 111</ref> excluding the preliminary processions.\n\n===Recognition, oath, and anointing of the King===\nThe first part of the service was the recognition, where the Archbishop of Canterbury called for those present to proclaim their recognition of the sovereign as their rightful king. The King was conducted by the Garter King of Arms to St Edward's Chair, and the Archbishop, as tradition dictates, asked: \"Sirs, I here present unto you King George, your undoubted King: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?\" The people replied loudly at each repetition \"God save King George\". The king then sat in the Chair of State and the regalia, except the swords, were laid on the altar.<ref name=LG-7054>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, p. 7054</ref> The King then knelt before the altar and swore on the Bible his coronation oath, a copy of which he then signed.<ref name=LG-7054/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury then began the Communion Service, while the Bishop of London read the Epistle and the Archbishop of York the Gospel; after the Service concluded, the King and Queen knelt while the choir sang \"''Veni, Creator Spiritus''\". This marked the beginning of the anointing of the monarch, when the Archbishop of Canterbury marks the monarch's head with oil to symbolise the introduction of the Holy Spirit. The Choir sang Handel's ''Zadok the Priest'' and the Archbishop prayed, before the King was disrobed and sat in St Edward's Chair, with the Canopy borne by four knights of the Garter placed over him. The Archbishop then anointed him with oil from the [[Ampulla]], which had been poured onto the Anointing Spoon.\n\n===Crowning the King===\nIn preparation for his crowning, the King, still on St Edward's Chair, was invested with the two coronation robes, the ''[[Colobium Sindonis]]'' and the ''Supertunica'' by the Dean of Westminster. Next, he was invested with the regalia, each of which symbolised his progress to kingship. First, the Lord Great Chamberlain touched the King's heels with the Golden Spurs; the Great Sword of State was deposited in St Edward's Chapel and the Jewelled Sword of Offering was passed to the King by the Archbishops and Bishops, who said \"With this sword do justice\"; the King then offered this sword at the altar. Seated again, the Lord Great Chamberlain fastened the [[armill]]s and the Dean invested the King with the Royal Robe; the Archbishop passed him the Orb, put the Ring on his fourth finger and handed to him the two sceptres\u2014with the cross (for Royal power) and with the dove (for \"mercy and equity\"). [[Henry Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 9th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|The Earl of Lincoln]], as Deputy of the Lord of the [[Manor of Worksop]], then handed over a glove, which the King wore.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, pp. 7055\u201356</ref>\n\nOnce adorned with his regalia and seated in St Edward's Chair, King George was crowned with St Edward's Crown by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the people in the abbey proclaimed loudly \"God save the King\"; the peers and peeresses wore their coronets (the only time that this happens) and the guns in the Royal Parks were fired to mark the crowning.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, p. 7056</ref> The ceremony appeared to run smoothly, although there were a few inconspicuous mishaps: the Archbishop of Canterbury almost placed the crown on the King's head the wrong way, one bishop stepped on the King's train, and another concealed the words of the Oath with his thumb while the King was reading it.<ref name=\"Abbey\"/>\n\n===Enthronement and homage to the King===\n[[File:Coronation of H.M. George VI and Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|right|A print after a 1938 painting by [[Frank O. Salisbury]], depicting the coronation service.]] \nIn the text of the service, this part of the ceremony was described using the archaic term \"inthronization\". The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] presented the Bible to the King and the King returned it to him, who gave it to the Dean, who placed it on the Altar. The King handed the glove over to the Lord Chamberlain of the Household and the Sceptre with the Cross to the Lord of the Manor of Worksop. The Benediction followed and then the King moved over to the other throne, accompanied by the Bishops of Bath and Wells and of Durham, the Great Officers of State, the Lords carrying the swords and the Lords who had carried the regalia. The Archbishop knelt and paid homage to the King; the Archbishop of York did so next, followed by each of the Bishops. The Dukes of the Blood Royal then did homage, followed by the Lords Temporal (Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons);<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34453/supplement/7056/ ''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, pp. 7056\u201357]; list of peers pp. 7057\u201373</ref> six anthems were sung by the Choir during the homage: \"O come ye servants of the Lord\", \"[[Hear my prayer, O Lord (Purcell)|Hear my prayer, O Lord]]\", \"O clap your hands together, all ye people\", \"All the ends of the world shall remember themselves\", \"O praise God in His holiness\" and \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace\".<ref name=\"London Gazette 1937\">''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, p. 7073</ref>\n\n===The Queen===\n\nThe Queen was crowned and anointed in a much smaller and simpler ceremony. This began immediately after the homage to the King finished, when the Queen knelt in prayer before the altar. She then went to the [[Faldstool]], which had been placed before the altar, where she knelt under a canopy, which was held by the Duchesses of Norfolk, [[Kathleen Manners, Duchess of Rutland|Rutland]], [[Duke of Buccleuch|Buccleuch]] and [[Duke of Roxburghe|Roxburghe]]. The Archbishop anointed her, placed on her fourth finger on her right hand the Queen's ring and then crowned her, at which point the Princesses and Peeresses donned their coronets. She was then handed her Sceptre with the Cross and the Ivory Rod with the Dove, before walking over to her own throne beside the King, where she sat.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1937\"/>\n\n===End of the service===\nThe ''Offertory'' followed, in which the King and Queen offered their regalia on the Altar. They then received [[Holy Communion]] from the Archbishop and were passed their crowns before returning to their thrones where they were also given their sceptres back. ''[[Te Deum]]'' was sung by the choir. A recess followed, during which the King and Queen proceeded to St Edward's Chapel. There, the King delivered the Sceptre with the Dove to the Archbishop who laid it on the altar. The bearers of the Orb, the Golden Spurs and St Edward's Staff delivered these to the Dean of Westminster, who laid them on the altar in the chapel. The King was disrobed of his Royal Robe of State by the Lord Great Chamberlain and put on the Robe of Purple Velvet. The King, now wearing the [[Imperial State Crown]], was then given the Orb by the Archbishop.\n\nWhile the King and Queen were in the chapel, the Officers of Arms arranged the procession out of the abbey, which was similar in form to the procession into the abbey. The King and Queen then joined the procession, with the King carrying the Sceptre with the Cross in his right hand and the Orb in his left, while the Queen carried her Sceptre with the Cross in her right hand and the Ivory Rod with the Dove in her left.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, pp. 7073\u201374</ref> They proceeded to the West Door of the Abbey as the National Anthem, \"[[God Save the King]]\", was sung.\n\n==State Procession to Buckingham Palace==\n[[File:Koning George VI van het Verenigd Koninkrijk en koningin Elizabeth in een koets na hun kroning te Westminster Abbey, RP-F-F21113.jpg|thumb|right|The king and queen in the [[Gold State Coach]] during the procession.]]\n{{See also|List of participants in the coronation processions of King George VI#Procession from the Abbey to Buckingham Palace}}\n\nAs in the 1902 and 1911 events, the coronation was followed by a procession through London's streets from Westminster Abbey to the Royal residence, allowing the public to view the new king and queen.

It has been somewhat overshadowed in history by the larger [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953; the Abbey's sacrist, Jocelyn Perkins, said that the 1953 event was \"out and away the most impressive\" of the 1953, 1937 and 1911 coronations.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 494</ref> Nonetheless, a number of those present, the King included, commented privately on the spirituality of the ceremony. Despite recalling it as being \"inordinately long\" and remembering how heavy the crown and robes were, the Queen said that it was \"wonderful and there is a great sense of offering oneself\".<ref>Beaken, ''Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis'', 2012, p. 135</ref> The King wrote to Lang thanking him for his support and, although he said it was an \"ordeal\", he also wrote that \"I felt I was being helped all the time by Someone Else as you said I would\".<ref>Beaken, ''Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis'', 2012, pp. 134\u201335</ref>\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n===Radio===\nThe Coronation ceremony itself was not televised, but it was the first coronation service to be broadcast on radio; 28 microphones were placed around the Abbey to capture the music and speech. There was no commentary, but the Reverend [[Frederic Iremonger]], Director of Religion at the BBC and [[Honorary Chaplain to the King]], read out the [[rubrics]] or written directions from the service book from a seat high in the [[triforium]] over [[Edward the Confessor|Saint Edward]]'s Chapel. During the most sacred parts of the service, the [[consecration]] and the [[Holy Communion]], the microphones were turned off and listeners heard hymns being sung by the choir in the Church of [[St Margaret, Westminster]].<ref>[http://www.radiotimesarchive.co.uk/pdf/RT-TV-SUPP-1937.pdf \"Plans for the Coronation Broadcast\"], ''Radio Times'', 7 May 1937, pp. 10\u201311</ref> The ability to project the service to citizens of the Empire allowed the Coronation to further Britain's imperial ambitions; as Range wrote, \"with the twentieth century there also came a heightened awareness of ... the propagandistic qualities of the event\".<ref>Range, ''Music and Ceremonial at British Coronations'', 2012, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe [[BBC]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] jointly transmitted the proclamation of George VI. In the lead up to the Coronation, the BBC organised talks by Ministers to be broadcast under the name ''Responsibilities of Empire'', and also broadcast ''The Empire's Homage'' featuring messages from colonial officers and citizens from across the Empire.<ref>Potter, ''Broadcasting Empire'', 2012, p. 99</ref> The BBC's [[BBC World Service|Empire Service]] broadcast the whole service, lasting two-and-a-half hours.<ref>Potter, ''Broadcasting Empire'', 2012, p. 94</ref>\n\n===Television===\nThe procession was broadcast on the [[BBC Television Service]], which had only been operating since the previous November. Several tons of television cables, measuring {{convert|8|mi}}, were laid across central London,<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|title=The story of BBC Television \u2013 Television out and about|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/tvhistory/out.shtml|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> so that the images from three [[Iconoscope|Emitron]] [[television camera]]s could be sent to the transmission centre at [[Alexandra Palace]]. Commentary was by [[Frederick Grisewood]], who was with the cameras at [[Hyde Park Corner]]. The coverage of the procession is regarded as being the BBC's first [[outside broadcast]].<ref name=BBC/> In reviewing the broadcast, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented: \"Horse and foot, the Coronation procession marched into English homes yesterday,\" while the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said: \"When the King and Queen appeared the picture was so vivid that one felt that this magical television is going to be one of the greatest of all modern inventions.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n===Newsreels===\nThe coronation service of George VI was the first to be filmed; the 40 camera crew inside the Abbey were required to wear [[Black tie|evening dress]]. It was later shown in edited form as a [[newsreel]] in cinemas across the [[British Empire]]. The service was later broadcast from these recordings, with the authorities censoring only one small section: a clip of Queen Mary wiping a tear from her eye.<ref>S.

The 1902 Coronation was the first to see such a programme implemented, but 1937 was nearly twice as long, and, building on similar developments in 1911, it was a very public spectacle; Sir Roy Strong argues that the month-long festivities were designed to \"recapture the confidence of the nation\" following the abdication crisis.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 446\u2013447</ref> The first week saw receptions for foreign visitors and delegates, while a State Banquet was held on May 10, but the weeks following the coronation saw more public spectacles; the following day included a royal drive through north London, May 16 included a luncheon at [[Guildhall]] with London dignitaries and the 'Empire Service of Youth' in Westminster. On May 20 and 21, the King and Queen inspected fleets and visited flagships, while, on May 22, the Queen visited [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to inspect [[St John's Ambulance|St John's ambulances]] and then drove through another area in North London.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 447\u2013448</ref>\n\n[[File:Timbre NZ AvenementG6 6p 1937.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Commemorative stamp, issued in New Zealand.]]\n[[File:1937 3d Coronation stamp of Swaziland.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Another stamp, issued by Swaziland.]]\n\n===Coronation honours, medals, coinage and stamps===\n{{see also|1937 Coronation Honours|King George VI Coronation Medal}}\n\nThe King marked the occasion of his coronation by conferring honours on a select group of his subjects; in all, thirteen peerages and seven baronetcies were created, while appointments were made to the Privy Council and to the Orders of the Garter, Thistle, Bath, Merit, Star of India, St Michael and St George and the Royal Victorian Order.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34396/supplement/3074 ''The London Gazette''], 11 May 1937, issue no. 34396, pp. 3074\u20133105</ref> An official medal was also struck to mark the occasion, as is customary; however, unlike his father's and grandfather's coronation medals, it was produced in one class.<ref>Joslin, ''The Standard Catalogue of British Orders and Decorations'', 1976, p. 36</ref> The medal was issued to 90,279 people from across the Empire.<ref name=ca-vet-aff>[http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/medals-decorations/commemorative-medals/kgvicm \"King George VI Coronation Medal (1937)\"], Veterans Affairs of Canada (official site), ''veterans.gc.ca'' (accessed on 30 May 2014)</ref> Canada, for instance, was allowed just over 10,000, with many being issued to commanding officers in the military, cabinet ministers, senators and their staff and the staff of the [[Governor-General of Canada|Governor-General]].<ref name=ca-vet-aff/>\n\nThe [[Royal Mint]] issued two special 1937 coin sets comprising the coinage for that year and commemorative issues. 5,501 gold [[Sovereign (British coin)|Sovereigns]] and [[Half Sovereign|half-Sovereigns]] were minted (the only ones of George VI's reign).

George VI ascended the throne upon the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication of his brother]], [[Edward VIII]], on 11 December 1936, three days before his 41st birthday. Edward's coronation had been planned for 12 May 1937 and it was decided to continue with his brother and sister-in-law's coronation on the same date.\n\nAlthough the music included a range of new anthems and the ceremony underwent some alterations to include the [[Dominion]]s, it remained a largely conservative affair and closely followed the ceremonial of George V's coronation in 1911. The ceremony began with the [[anointing]] of the King, symbolising his spiritual entry into kingship, and then his [[Crown (headgear)|crowning]] and enthronement, representing his assumption of temporal powers and responsibilities. The peers of the realm then [[Homage (feudal)|paid homage]] to the King before a shorter and simpler ceremony was conducted for the Queen's coronation. The return procession to [[Buckingham Palace]] was over {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} in length, making it the longest coronation procession up to that time; crowds of people lined the streets to watch it, over 32,000 soldiers took part and 20,000 police officers lined the route. The coronation was commemorated by the issuing of official [[King George VI Coronation Medal|medals]], coinage, and stamps, by military parades across the Empire, and by numerous unofficial celebrations, including street parties and the production of memorabilia.\n\nThe event was designed to be not only a sacred anointing and formal crowning, but also a public spectacle, which was also planned as a display of the British Empire. May 1937 included a programme of royal events lasting nearly the entire month to commemorate and mark the occasion. As a preliminary to the coronation, guests from across the Empire and around the world assembled at Buckingham Palace and official receptions were held to welcome them; amongst those attending were [[India]]n princes and, for the first time, native [[Africa]]n royalty. For the event itself, the [[prime minister]]s of each Dominion took part in the procession to the abbey, while representatives of nearly every country attended. Contingents from most colonies and each Dominion participated in the return procession through [[London]]'s streets.\n\nThe media played an important part in broadcasting this show of pageantry and imperialism to the Empire. The coronation was an important event in the [[history of television]], being the country's first major [[outside broadcast]], although television cameras were not allowed inside the abbey. It was also the first coronation to be filmed, as well as the first to be broadcast on radio.\n\n==Background==\n===Accession===\n{{Further|Succession to the British throne|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}\n[[File:Tumbler, coronation (AM 10638-2).jpg|thumb|right|A commemorative [[Tumbler (glass)|glass tumbler]], produced for the coronation of King Edward VIII, planned for 12 May 1937.]]\nIn January 1936, King [[George V]] died and his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]], succeeded him as king-emperor of the British Empire. He was unmarried at that time, but the American socialite, [[Wallis Simpson]], had accompanied him on numerous social occasions in years leading up to 1936; she was married to the shipping executive [[Ernest Aldrich Simpson]] and had previously been divorced. The relationship had not been reported in the British press, but was receiving considerable media attention in the United States; it was controversial due to her being divorced, a status considered incompatible with the King's position as the nominal head of the [[Church of England]], which did not at that time permit remarriage after divorce.<ref>https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/marriage,-family-and-sexuality-issues/divorce.aspx</ref>\n\nIn October 1936 Simpson filed for divorce, and the King informed the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], that he intended to marry her. Baldwin and several leading imperial administrators advised the King that popular opinion in the dominions was hostile to the proposed marriage; at home, the King also faced opposition from the Church of England and from factions in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The widespread unwillingness to accept Simpson as the King's consort, and Edward's refusal to give her up, led to his abdication in December 1936.<ref>Matthew, \"Edward VIII (later Prince Edward, duke of Windsor) (1894\u20131972)\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004</ref>\n\nHe was succeeded by his next younger brother, [[George VI]]. Before his accession, George had been known as Prince Albert, [[Duke of York]]; his [[regnal name]] was chosen in honour of his late father. In 1923, he had married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the daughter of the [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]].\n\n===Coronation ceremony===\n{{Further|Coronation of the British monarch}}\nAlthough the reign of the British monarch begins on his or her succession to the throne, the coronation service marks their formal investiture. In 1937, the ceremony was organised by a Coronation Committee, established by the [[Privy Council]] and chaired by the [[Lord President of the Council]], a political appointment; its central component, the Executive Committee, was chaired by [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]], who inherited the office of [[Earl Marshal]], which carries with it, by convention, the responsibility for the organisation and coordination of the coronation ceremony.<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 421\">Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 421</ref><ref name=\"Queen Elizabeth pp. 16-17\">''The Coronation Book of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth'', n.d., pp. 16-17</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n===Planning===\nThe Coronation Committee had been delayed when it met for the first time on 24 June 1936: [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the [[Lord President of the Council]], met the Duke of Norfolk to discuss the proceedings; MacDonald would chair the Coronation Committee as a whole, and the Duke would chair the Executive Committee. While Edward VIII was away, cruising on the ''[[Nahlin (yacht)|Nahlin]]'' with Wallis Simpson, his brother, Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI) sat in his place on the committees.<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 421\"/> Edward VIII had initially been reluctant to have a coronation at all (asking the Archbishop of Canterbury whether it could be dispensed with), but conceded that a shorter service would be acceptable; his desire for a lower-key event led to the planned abandonment of the royal procession through London the following day, the thanksgiving service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and the dinner with London dignitaries.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 421\u2013422</ref>\n\nAfter the abdication of Edward VIII, the coronation committee continued to plan the event for George VI with minimal disruption; according to [[Roy Strong|Sir Roy Strong]], at the next meeting after the abdication \"no reference was made at all to the change of sovereign, everything immediately being assumed to have been done for the new king.\"<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 422</ref> After the abdication, though, many of the traditional elements that Edward VIII cared less for were restored, with Queen Mary taking an interest in the design of furniture and insisting on a more traditional appearance; indeed, much of the service and the furnishings were to closely resemble those of the 1911 coronation of George V.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 423</ref>\n\n===Archbishop of Canterbury===\n[[File:AbpCosmoLang.jpg|thumb|right|Archbishop Cosmo Lang, painted in 1937 with his coronation [[cope]] and [[mitre]] by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]].]]\nAlthough the Executive Committee was chaired by the Earl Marshal, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Cosmo Lang]], was also a driving force behind the preparations for the 1937 coronation; and many of the decisions about the order of service were made by or with him. He was an ''ex officio'' member of both the Executive Committee and the Coronation Committee, which dealt with the detail and, as such, he attended all of the rehearsals. He tended to take a leading role in the planning process, becoming a key mediator when queries arose, and dealing with questions of how the service should be broadcast by the media.<ref>Beaken, Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis, 2012, pp. 132\u2013133</ref> Lang also spoke to the nation through the BBC services in the run-up to Coronation Day; he saw the Coronation as an opportunity for the spiritual renewal of the nation, and he organised a campaign of [[evangelism]] called ''Recall to Religion'', which he launched on 27 December 1936 with an address on BBC radio. He was also keen to ensure that the King and Queen understood the religious nuances of the service, and held two meetings with the couple beforehand.<ref name=\"Beaken, 2012, pp. 132\">Beaken, ''Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis'', 2012, pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n\nThe Archbishop met the King and Queen on the evening before their coronation, running through the ceremony and explaining the most important parts. He was also concerned about King George's [[speech impediment|stutter]] and discussed the matter with Lord Dawson of Penn and Lord Wigram; [[Lionel Logue]] was then the King's speech therapist and the Archbishop discussed replacing him, but decided to monitor the King's improvement and Logue remained his therapist. As it happened, the King delivered his speech without stuttering.<ref name=\"Beaken, 2012, pp. 132\"/>\n\n===Construction===\nThe coronation cost \u00a3454,000, which was more than three times the cost of the 1911 ceremony.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 458</ref> This cost included the construction of the annexe, which was built as a temporary add-on at the entrance of the abbey for each coronation. In previous years, it had taken the form of an imitation Gothic entrance, but, as a remnant of Edward VIII's modernising attitude, it was now an [[art-deco]] design, adorned with stylised heraldic beasts and tapestries belonging to [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 8th Duke of Buccleuch|the Duke of Buccleuch]].<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 423, 459\u2013460 and 462</ref> For each coronation, special seating was also constructed to accommodate the large number of guests; 1937 was the first year to make use of metal structures to support the seats, in the form of tubular steel. 400 tons were used alongside {{convert|72,000|ft3|m3|abbr=off|lk=off}} of wood, with 400 men working on the construction. The theatre and [[sacrarium]] were also lowered to floor level for the first time since the restoration{{clarify|date=December 2017}}.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 462\u2013463</ref>\n\n===Imperial considerations===\n[[File:George VI coronation display, Toronto, 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eaton's]] department store window in [[Toronto]] displaying mannequins of George and Elizabeth wearing their crowns and holding orbs]]\n\nIn 1911, standards of the Dominions, autonomous communities of the British Empire, were borne during the procession, but, after the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which established legislative equality between the Dominions and the United Kingdom, the actual service and coronation rite needed to be updated to reflect this change in political power within the Empire. Furthermore, the fact that the service was an Anglican rite excluded other faiths and denominations; in 1937, several Dominions had premiers who were [[Catholic]] and, by that time, laws which previously excluded people from public office on religious grounds had been repealed.<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 442\">Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 442</ref> The Coronation Committee altered the rite to reflect this change; the King now swore to maintain \"the Protestant Reformed Religion only as established by law in the United Kingdom.\"<ref name=\"Strong, 2005, p. 442\"/> During Edward VIII's reign, a committee was established and chaired by the Duke of York to investigate how colonial representatives might be included within the ceremony, but the Committee failed to implement any changes, except to the [[Coronation Oath]]. This was the first amendment to the oath since the coronation of [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] in 1689.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17305392 The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW) \u2013 Saturday 20 February 1937 \u2013 ''CORONATION OATH: FORM ANNOUNCED'']</ref>\n\nAlthough 1937 saw an increase in the colonial contingents partaking in the procession and an official lunch in [[Westminster Hall]] was given to Parliamentary representatives of Empire states for the first time, the service itself was barely altered to reflect the new status of the Dominions.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 443\u2013444</ref>\n\n==Guests==\nThe ceremony was attended by the King's and Queen's daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Princesses Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], as well as by the King's mother, the dowager [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref name=Abbey>{{cite web|title=\"George VI\", Westminster Abbey (official website)|website=westminster-abbey.org|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/royals/george-vi/|accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref> Members of the extended Royal Family attended and all peers and members of parliament were invited.

At 09:49, members of the Royal Family left the palace (Queen Mary's carriage left Marlborough House shortly afterwards at 10:13). The King and Queen then travelled in the [[Gold State Coach]] from Buckingham Palace at 10:43; their procession was by far the longest and included numerous military contingents and delegates from Britain, the Dominions, and the colonies, as well as members of the [[War Office]], the Army, Naval and Air Boards and the personal aides-de-camp.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue 34453, pp. 3071\u20133077</ref>\n\n==Procession into the abbey==\n{{See also|List of participants in the coronation processions of George VI}}\n\n===Minor royals and foreign representatives===\nThe first to arrive in procession were the royals and foreign representatives; they arrived ten minutes after departing the palace.

Then, Queen Mary's Lord Chamberlain ([[Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey|the Marquess of Anglesey]]) led Queen Mary, whose train was borne by four pages (the Earl of Dalkeith, the Marquess of Lansdowne, Gerald Lascelles, and Viscount Errington) and who was attended by the Mistress of the Robes (the Duchess of Devonshire), two ladies of the bedchamber in waiting, her private secretary, comptroller, and three equerries (two ordinary and one extra).<ref name=\"LG-7044-5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34453/supplement/7044/ |title=''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937 issue no. 34453, pp. 7044\u201345 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the King and Queen===\nA guard of honour had formed at the vestibule and at the entrance, and the King and Queen arrived at 11:00. On their entry, they were greeted by the Great Officers of State, the Archbishops, and the peers bearing the regalia. They then formed their procession, which was led by the King's Chaplain and the Chapter at Westminster, who were followed by representatives of the Free Churches and the Church of Scotland. The procession involved all of the Great Officers of State, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Lord Mayor of London, the Officers of Arms of England and Scotland, the Standards of each Dominion, the Prime Ministers of the UK and of each of the Dominions, and the most senior and highest-ranking officials in the Royal Household. They were followed by twelve members of the Yeoman of the Guard and six of its officials. The King and Queen walked surrounded by their regalia, borne by the designated peers; King George wore his great robes of state, which had to be carried by nine pages. They walked past the choir, in which sat the foreign representatives and delegates, before passing through the screen; after this, they sat or stood in their designated area and the King and Queen took their seats in the Chairs of State in front of the royal box. As the King and Queen and the procession proceeded, the choir sang ''[[I was glad]]'' with the traditional acclamations of ''Vivat Regina Elizabetha'' and ''Vivat Rex Georgius'' by the [[King's Scholar (Westminster School)|King's Scholar]]s of [[Westminster School]].\n\n==Service==\n[[File:Coronation of George VI 1937.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the coronation service by [[Henry Charles Brewer]] (1866 \u2013 1943) and published in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''.]] \nThe coronation service itself began once the procession into the abbey was over and the King and Queen were seated. Beginning with the recognition, the King then took an oath and was anointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, before being crowned king. As a remnant of the coronation ceremony's feudal origins, the King then received homage from the peers and peeresses of the realm in attendance.\n\nThere were few departures from the services conducted at previous coronations. Efforts were made to shorten the lengthy proceedings: the [[litany]] was sung during the regalia procession before the start of the service, and the [[sermon]] was omitted entirely.<ref>Range, ''Music and Ceremonial at British Coronations: From James I to Elizabeth II'', 2003, p. 243</ref> Even so, the service itself lasted for two and a half hours,<ref>Lacey, ''Monarch: The Life and Reign of Elizabeth II'', p. 111</ref> excluding the preliminary processions.\n\n===Recognition, oath, and anointing of the King===\nThe first part of the service was the recognition, where the Archbishop of Canterbury called for those present to proclaim their recognition of the sovereign as their rightful king. The King was conducted by the Garter King of Arms to St Edward's Chair, and the Archbishop, as tradition dictates, asked: \"Sirs, I here present unto you King George, your undoubted King: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?\" The people replied loudly at each repetition \"God save King George\". The king then sat in the Chair of State and the regalia, except the swords, were laid on the altar.<ref name=LG-7054>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, p. 7054</ref> The King then knelt before the altar and swore on the Bible his coronation oath, a copy of which he then signed.<ref name=LG-7054/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury then began the Communion Service, while the Bishop of London read the Epistle and the Archbishop of York the Gospel; after the Service concluded, the King and Queen knelt while the choir sang \"''Veni, Creator Spiritus''\". This marked the beginning of the anointing of the monarch, when the Archbishop of Canterbury marks the monarch's head with oil to symbolise the introduction of the Holy Spirit. The Choir sang Handel's ''Zadok the Priest'' and the Archbishop prayed, before the King was disrobed and sat in St Edward's Chair, with the Canopy borne by four knights of the Garter placed over him. The Archbishop then anointed him with oil from the [[Ampulla]], which had been poured onto the Anointing Spoon.\n\n===Crowning the King===\nIn preparation for his crowning, the King, still on St Edward's Chair, was invested with the two coronation robes, the ''[[Colobium Sindonis]]'' and the ''Supertunica'' by the Dean of Westminster. Next, he was invested with the regalia, each of which symbolised his progress to kingship. First, the Lord Great Chamberlain touched the King's heels with the Golden Spurs; the Great Sword of State was deposited in St Edward's Chapel and the Jewelled Sword of Offering was passed to the King by the Archbishops and Bishops, who said \"With this sword do justice\"; the King then offered this sword at the altar. Seated again, the Lord Great Chamberlain fastened the [[armill]]s and the Dean invested the King with the Royal Robe; the Archbishop passed him the Orb, put the Ring on his fourth finger and handed to him the two sceptres\u2014with the cross (for Royal power) and with the dove (for \"mercy and equity\"). [[Henry Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 9th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|The Earl of Lincoln]], as Deputy of the Lord of the [[Manor of Worksop]], then handed over a glove, which the King wore.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, pp. 7055\u201356</ref>\n\nOnce adorned with his regalia and seated in St Edward's Chair, King George was crowned with St Edward's Crown by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the people in the abbey proclaimed loudly \"God save the King\"; the peers and peeresses wore their coronets (the only time that this happens) and the guns in the Royal Parks were fired to mark the crowning.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, p. 7056</ref> The ceremony appeared to run smoothly, although there were a few inconspicuous mishaps: the Archbishop of Canterbury almost placed the crown on the King's head the wrong way, one bishop stepped on the King's train, and another concealed the words of the Oath with his thumb while the King was reading it.<ref name=\"Abbey\"/>\n\n===Enthronement and homage to the King===\n[[File:Coronation of H.M. George VI and Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|right|A print after a 1938 painting by [[Frank O. Salisbury]], depicting the coronation service.]] \nIn the text of the service, this part of the ceremony was described using the archaic term \"inthronization\". The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] presented the Bible to the King and the King returned it to him, who gave it to the Dean, who placed it on the Altar. The King handed the glove over to the Lord Chamberlain of the Household and the Sceptre with the Cross to the Lord of the Manor of Worksop. The Benediction followed and then the King moved over to the other throne, accompanied by the Bishops of Bath and Wells and of Durham, the Great Officers of State, the Lords carrying the swords and the Lords who had carried the regalia. The Archbishop knelt and paid homage to the King; the Archbishop of York did so next, followed by each of the Bishops. The Dukes of the Blood Royal then did homage, followed by the Lords Temporal (Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons);<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34453/supplement/7056/ ''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, pp. 7056\u201357]; list of peers pp. 7057\u201373</ref> six anthems were sung by the Choir during the homage: \"O come ye servants of the Lord\", \"[[Hear my prayer, O Lord (Purcell)|Hear my prayer, O Lord]]\", \"O clap your hands together, all ye people\", \"All the ends of the world shall remember themselves\", \"O praise God in His holiness\" and \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace\".<ref name=\"London Gazette 1937\">''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, p. 7073</ref>\n\n===The Queen===\n\nThe Queen was crowned and anointed in a much smaller and simpler ceremony. This began immediately after the homage to the King finished, when the Queen knelt in prayer before the altar. She then went to the [[Faldstool]], which had been placed before the altar, where she knelt under a canopy, which was held by the Duchesses of Norfolk, [[Kathleen Manners, Duchess of Rutland|Rutland]], [[Duke of Buccleuch|Buccleuch]] and [[Duke of Roxburghe|Roxburghe]]. The Archbishop anointed her, placed on her fourth finger on her right hand the Queen's ring and then crowned her, at which point the Princesses and Peeresses donned their coronets. She was then handed her Sceptre with the Cross and the Ivory Rod with the Dove, before walking over to her own throne beside the King, where she sat.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1937\"/>\n\n===End of the service===\nThe ''Offertory'' followed, in which the King and Queen offered their regalia on the Altar. They then received [[Holy Communion]] from the Archbishop and were passed their crowns before returning to their thrones where they were also given their sceptres back. ''[[Te Deum]]'' was sung by the choir. A recess followed, during which the King and Queen proceeded to St Edward's Chapel. There, the King delivered the Sceptre with the Dove to the Archbishop who laid it on the altar. The bearers of the Orb, the Golden Spurs and St Edward's Staff delivered these to the Dean of Westminster, who laid them on the altar in the chapel. The King was disrobed of his Royal Robe of State by the Lord Great Chamberlain and put on the Robe of Purple Velvet. The King, now wearing the [[Imperial State Crown]], was then given the Orb by the Archbishop.\n\nWhile the King and Queen were in the chapel, the Officers of Arms arranged the procession out of the abbey, which was similar in form to the procession into the abbey. The King and Queen then joined the procession, with the King carrying the Sceptre with the Cross in his right hand and the Orb in his left, while the Queen carried her Sceptre with the Cross in her right hand and the Ivory Rod with the Dove in her left.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 10 November 1937, issue no. 34453, pp. 7073\u201374</ref> They proceeded to the West Door of the Abbey as the National Anthem, \"[[God Save the King]]\", was sung.\n\n==State Procession to Buckingham Palace==\n[[File:Koning George VI van het Verenigd Koninkrijk en koningin Elizabeth in een koets na hun kroning te Westminster Abbey, RP-F-F21113.jpg|thumb|right|The king and queen in the [[Gold State Coach]] during the procession.]]\n{{See also|List of participants in the coronation processions of King George VI#Procession from the Abbey to Buckingham Palace}}\n\nAs in the 1902 and 1911 events, the coronation was followed by a procession through London's streets from Westminster Abbey to the Royal residence, allowing the public to view the new king and queen.

There were representative detachments from all the elements of the [[British armed forces]] and the [[Military reserve force#United Kigdom|reserve forces]], the [[British Indian Army]] and [[Royal Indian Navy]], contingents from the British Dominions and a contingent representing the defence forces of the Colonial Empire. Contingents taking part represented the following sections of the Empire: India, the dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, Newfoundland and South Africa, and the Colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland, the Gambia, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Aden, Transjordan, Malta, the West Indies, British Guiana, Honduras, Ceylon, the Falklands and Hong Kong.<ref>''The Central Queensland Herald'', 20 May 1937, p. 21</ref> In total there were 32,500 officers and men either marching or lining the route.

It has been somewhat overshadowed in history by the larger [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953; the Abbey's sacrist, Jocelyn Perkins, said that the 1953 event was \"out and away the most impressive\" of the 1953, 1937 and 1911 coronations.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, p. 494</ref> Nonetheless, a number of those present, the King included, commented privately on the spirituality of the ceremony. Despite recalling it as being \"inordinately long\" and remembering how heavy the crown and robes were, the Queen said that it was \"wonderful and there is a great sense of offering oneself\".<ref>Beaken, ''Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis'', 2012, p. 135</ref> The King wrote to Lang thanking him for his support and, although he said it was an \"ordeal\", he also wrote that \"I felt I was being helped all the time by Someone Else as you said I would\".<ref>Beaken, ''Cosmo Lang: Archbishop in War and Crisis'', 2012, pp. 134\u201335</ref>\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n===Radio===\nThe Coronation ceremony itself was not televised, but it was the first coronation service to be broadcast on radio; 28 microphones were placed around the Abbey to capture the music and speech. There was no commentary, but the Reverend [[Frederic Iremonger]], Director of Religion at the BBC and [[Honorary Chaplain to the King]], read out the [[rubrics]] or written directions from the service book from a seat high in the [[triforium]] over [[Edward the Confessor|Saint Edward]]'s Chapel. During the most sacred parts of the service, the [[consecration]] and the [[Holy Communion]], the microphones were turned off and listeners heard hymns being sung by the choir in the Church of [[St Margaret, Westminster]].<ref>[http://www.radiotimesarchive.co.uk/pdf/RT-TV-SUPP-1937.pdf \"Plans for the Coronation Broadcast\"], ''Radio Times'', 7 May 1937, pp. 10\u201311</ref> The ability to project the service to citizens of the Empire allowed the Coronation to further Britain's imperial ambitions; as Range wrote, \"with the twentieth century there also came a heightened awareness of ... the propagandistic qualities of the event\".<ref>Range, ''Music and Ceremonial at British Coronations'', 2012, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe [[BBC]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] jointly transmitted the proclamation of George VI. In the lead up to the Coronation, the BBC organised talks by Ministers to be broadcast under the name ''Responsibilities of Empire'', and also broadcast ''The Empire's Homage'' featuring messages from colonial officers and citizens from across the Empire.<ref>Potter, ''Broadcasting Empire'', 2012, p. 99</ref> The BBC's [[BBC World Service|Empire Service]] broadcast the whole service, lasting two-and-a-half hours.<ref>Potter, ''Broadcasting Empire'', 2012, p. 94</ref>\n\n===Television===\nThe procession was broadcast on the [[BBC Television Service]], which had only been operating since the previous November.

Commentary was by [[Frederick Grisewood]], who was with the cameras at [[Hyde Park Corner]]. The coverage of the procession is regarded as being the BBC's first [[outside broadcast]].<ref name=BBC/> In reviewing the broadcast, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented: \"Horse and foot, the Coronation procession marched into English homes yesterday,\" while the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said: \"When the King and Queen appeared the picture was so vivid that one felt that this magical television is going to be one of the greatest of all modern inventions.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n===Newsreels===\nThe coronation service of George VI was the first to be filmed; the 40 camera crew inside the Abbey were required to wear [[Black tie|evening dress]]. It was later shown in edited form as a [[newsreel]] in cinemas across the [[British Empire]]. The service was later broadcast from these recordings, with the authorities censoring only one small section: a clip of Queen Mary wiping a tear from her eye.<ref>S.

The 1902 Coronation was the first to see such a programme implemented, but 1937 was nearly twice as long, and, building on similar developments in 1911, it was a very public spectacle; Sir Roy Strong argues that the month-long festivities were designed to \"recapture the confidence of the nation\" following the abdication crisis.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 446\u2013447</ref> The first week saw receptions for foreign visitors and delegates, while a State Banquet was held on May 10, but the weeks following the coronation saw more public spectacles; the following day included a royal drive through north London, May 16 included a luncheon at [[Guildhall]] with London dignitaries and the 'Empire Service of Youth' in Westminster. On May 20 and 21, the King and Queen inspected fleets and visited flagships, while, on May 22, the Queen visited [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to inspect [[St John's Ambulance|St John's ambulances]] and then drove through another area in North London.<ref>Strong, ''Coronation'', 2005, pp. 447\u2013448</ref>\n\n[[File:Timbre NZ AvenementG6 6p 1937.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Commemorative stamp, issued in New Zealand.]]\n[[File:1937 3d Coronation stamp of Swaziland.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Another stamp, issued by Swaziland.]]\n\n===Coronation honours, medals, coinage and stamps===\n{{see also|1937 Coronation Honours|King George VI Coronation Medal}}\n\nThe King marked the occasion of his coronation by conferring honours on a select group of his subjects; in all, thirteen peerages and seven baronetcies were created, while appointments were made to the Privy Council and to the Orders of the Garter, Thistle, Bath, Merit, Star of India, St Michael and St George and the Royal Victorian Order.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34396/supplement/3074 ''The London Gazette''], 11 May 1937, issue no. 34396, pp. 3074\u20133105</ref> An official medal was also struck to mark the occasion, as is customary; however, unlike his father's and grandfather's coronation medals, it was produced in one class.<ref>Joslin, ''The Standard Catalogue of British Orders and Decorations'', 1976, p. 36</ref> The medal was issued to 90,279 people from across the Empire.<ref name=ca-vet-aff>[http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/medals-decorations/commemorative-medals/kgvicm \"King George VI Coronation Medal (1937)\"], Veterans Affairs of Canada (official site), ''veterans.gc.ca'' (accessed on 30 May 2014)</ref> Canada, for instance, was allowed just over 10,000, with many being issued to commanding officers in the military, cabinet ministers, senators and their staff and the staff of the [[Governor-General of Canada|Governor-General]].<ref name=ca-vet-aff/>\n\nThe [[Royal Mint]] issued two special 1937 coin sets comprising the coinage for that year and commemorative issues. 5,501 gold [[Sovereign (British coin)|Sovereigns]] and [[Half Sovereign|half-Sovereigns]] were minted (the only ones of George VI's reign).
