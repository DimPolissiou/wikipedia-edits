Once upon a time he was a lawyer.\"\n\n[[File:1978667 617502671638121 2046061910 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\n== About==\n\nDr Mark Tredinnick won the Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff International Poetry Prize in 2012. A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing.

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n'''Books'''\n\n'''Western Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n'''\n\n'''Queensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize''' \n Newcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\n Newcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

The spice is added to the food at the time of [[Chaunk|tempering]]. Sometimes dried and ground asafoetida (in small quantities) can be mixed with salt and eaten with raw salad.\n\nIn its pure form, it is sold in the form of chunks of resin, small quantities of which are scraped off for use. The odor of the pure resin is so strong that the pungent smell will contaminate other spices stored nearby if it is not stored in an airtight container.\n\n==Cultivation and manufacture==\nThe [[resin]]-like [[natural gum|gum]] comes from the dried [[sap]] extracted from the stem and roots and is used as a [[spice]]. The resin is greyish-white when fresh, but dries to a dark amber colour. The asafoetida resin is difficult to grate and is traditionally crushed between stones or with a hammer. Today, the most commonly available form is compounded asafoetida, a fine powder containing 30% asafoetida resin, along with [[rice flour]] or ''maida'' (white [[wheat flour]]) and [[gum arabic]].\n\n''Ferula assa-foetida'' is a [[monoecious]], [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], [[perennial plant]] of the family [[Apiaceae]]. It grows to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, with a circular mass of {{convert|30|\u2013|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} leaves. Stem leaves have wide sheathing [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s.

Flowers are pale greenish yellow produced in large compound [[umbel]]s. Fruits are oval, flat, thin, reddish brown and have a milky juice. Roots are thick, massive, and pulpy.

Though it is generally forgotten now in Europe, it is still widely used in India. It emerged into Europe from an expedition of [[Alexander the Great]], who, after returning from a trip to northeastern [[ancient Persia]], thought they had found a plant almost identical to the famed [[silphium]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in North Africa\u2014though less tasty. [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], in the first century, wrote, \"the Cyrenaic kind, even if one just tastes it, at once arouses a humour throughout the body and has a very healthy aroma, so that it is not noticed on the breath, or only a little; but the Median [Iranian] is weaker in power and has a nastier smell.\" Nevertheless, it could be substituted for silphium in cooking, which was fortunate, because a few decades after Dioscorides' time, the true silphium of Cyrene became extinct, and asafoetida became more popular amongst physicians, as well as cooks.<ref name=\"Dalby\">''Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices''. Andrew Dalby. 2000. University of California Press. Spices/ History. 184 pages.\n{{ISBN|0-520-23674-2}}</ref>\n\nAsafoetida is also mentioned numerous times in [[Jewish literature]], such as the [[Mishnah]].<ref>m. ''[[Avodah Zarah]]'' ch. 1; m. Shabbat ch. 20; et al.</ref> [[Maimonides]] also writes in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' \"In the rainy season, one should eat warm food with much spice, but a limited amount of mustard and asafoetida [\u05d7\u05b4\u05dc\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea ''chiltit''].\"<ref>''Mishneh Torah'', Laws of Opinions (Hilchot Deot) 4:8.</ref>\n\nAsafoetida was described by a number of Arab and Islamic scientists and pharmacists. [[Avicenna]] discussed the effects of asafoetida on digestion. [[Ibn al-Baitar]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] described some positive medicinal effects on the respiratory system.<ref>Avicenna (1999).

The spice is added to the food at the time of [[Chaunk|tempering]]. Sometimes dried and ground asafoetida (in small quantities) can be mixed with salt and eaten with raw salad.\n\nIn its pure form, it is sold in the form of chunks of resin, small quantities of which are scraped off for use. The odor of the pure resin is so strong that the pungent smell will contaminate other spices stored nearby if it is not stored in an airtight container.\n\n==Cultivation and manufacture==\nThe [[resin]]-like [[natural gum|gum]] comes from the dried [[sap]] extracted from the stem and roots and is used as a [[spice]]. The resin is greyish-white when fresh, but dries to a dark amber colour. The asafoetida resin is difficult to grate and is traditionally crushed between stones or with a hammer. Today, the most commonly available form is compounded asafoetida, a fine powder containing 30% asafoetida resin, along with [[rice flour]] or ''maida'' (white [[wheat flour]]) and [[gum arabic]].\n\n''Ferula assa-foetida'' is a [[monoecious]], [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], [[perennial plant]] of the family [[Apiaceae]].

Flowers are pale greenish yellow produced in large compound [[umbel]]s. Fruits are oval, flat, thin, reddish brown and have a milky juice. Roots are thick, massive, and pulpy.

Though it is generally forgotten now in Europe, it is still widely used in India. It emerged into Europe from an expedition of [[Alexander the Great]], who, after returning from a trip to northeastern [[ancient Persia]], thought they had found a plant almost identical to the famed [[silphium]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in North Africa\u2014though less tasty. [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], in the first century, wrote, \"the Cyrenaic kind, even if one just tastes it, at once arouses a humour throughout the body and has a very healthy aroma, so that it is not noticed on the breath, or only a little; but the Median [Iranian] is weaker in power and has a nastier smell.\" Nevertheless, it could be substituted for silphium in cooking, which was fortunate, because a few decades after Dioscorides' time, the true silphium of Cyrene became extinct, and asafoetida became more popular amongst physicians, as well as cooks.<ref name=\"Dalby\">''Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices''.

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda.

The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us.\"<ref name=\"elphiechanges\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Act I===\nIn the [[Land of Oz]], the Ozians are rejoicing over the demise of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. [[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]]. All of the songs featured on stage are present on the recording with the exception of \"The Wizard and I (Reprise)\" and \"The Wicked Witch of the East\".

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year. Its original stars included [[Idina Menzel]] as Elphaba, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Glinda, and [[Joel Grey]] as the Wizard.<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13485 |title=Wicked |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |work= [[Internet Broadway Database]]}}</ref> The original Broadway production won three [[Tony Award]]s and seven [[Drama Desk Award]]s, while its original cast album received a [[Grammy Award]].\n\n''Wicked'' celebrated its sixteenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2019.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]].
