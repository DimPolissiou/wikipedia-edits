One of the runners is steerable. Originally, such craft were boats with a support structure, riding on the runners and steered with a rear blade, as with a conventional rudder. As iceboats evolved, the structure became a frame with a seat or cockpit for the iceboat sailor, resting on runners. Steering was shifted to the front. \n\nBecause of their low resistance to forward motion over ice, iceboats are capable of speeds exceeding {{Convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=}}. Iceboats commonly used for racing are usually only for one person, but several examples exist of two-seat and multiple-seat iceboats.\n\nA related activity, [[land sailing]], employs sailing craft similar to iceboats, but riding on wheels instead of runners.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\n[[File:Ice yachters on Hudson River near Barrytown, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Classic iceboats on the [[Hudson River]] at [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown, NY]]|alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them.

Initially boats were used for commerce, but soon evolved into pleasure craft\u2014\"ice yachts\". Ice sailing came to North America, where the sailing craft evolved into recreational and racing versions.\n\n=== Venues ===\nIceboating began in the 17th century as a documented means of transport on the frozen Gulf of Riga and the canals of the Netherlands into the 18th century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/iceboating|title=Iceboating {{!}} sport|last=Editors|first=|date=February 17, 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Ice boats carried cargo on Dutch canals during the 17th century.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Spectre|first=Peter H.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173009383|title=A mariner's book of days, 2007|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|year=|isbn=1-57409-226-X|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|pages=|oclc=173009383}}</ref> \n\nThe first iceboats were introduced on New York State's Hudson River in the United States in 1790, where the practice flourished as a sport. The first recorded boat, built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie, was a square box atop three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acted as a rudder operated by a tiller.

Boats were as long as {{Convert|69|ft|m|abbr=}} and sailed as fast as {{Convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=}}, a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881 on the Hudson river with five ice-yacht clubs competing.

In Canada, there were venues on [[Lake Ontario]] (Kingston) and the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA European ice sailing club formed first in Sweden (1901), followed by the European Ice Yachting Union, which formed in 1928 with member states Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Austria, and Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n17th-century Dutch ice yachts consisted of flat-bottomed sailboats atop a cross-wise plank, resting on outboard metal runners, which carried the bulk of the weight of the craft. At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.<ref name=\":03\" /> In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. <nowiki>''</nowiki>Robert Scott<nowiki>''</nowiki>, designed and built by H.

Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop [[Forces on sails|propulsive lift]]. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can sail up to ten times the speed of the true wind. Because the velocity of the iceboat (V<sub>B</sub>) is so much greater than the true wind velocity (V<sub>T</sub>), the apparent wind (V<sub>A</sub>) is only a few degrees from the direction of travel on most [[Point of sail|points of sail]] and the sail is close-hauled in each.

At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.<ref name=\":03\" /> In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. <nowiki>''</nowiki>Robert Scott<nowiki>''</nowiki>, designed and built by H.

Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop [[Forces on sails|propulsive lift]]. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can sail up to ten times the speed of the true wind. Because the velocity of the iceboat (V<sub>B</sub>) is so much greater than the true wind velocity (V<sub>T</sub>), the apparent wind (V<sub>A</sub>) is only a few degrees from the direction of travel on most [[Point of sail|points of sail]] and the sail is close-hauled in each.
