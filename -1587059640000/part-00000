It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as the worst game ever. Players control [[Sanic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Fo o o kc face, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]], and the team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007). As a result, ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' was rushed so it could release in time for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]], and the team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007). As a result, ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' was rushed so it could release in time for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

{"title_page": "Winshill", "text_new": "Lying on what was formerly the [[Derbyshire]] side of the [[River Trent]], '''Winshill''' was transformed in the mid 19th century from a secluded settlement into a large village with extensive housing for workers in [[Burton upon Trent]]. Later in the century middle-class houses were built along the Ashby road, and there has also been extensive 20th century council and private housing development in the south-eastern part of the township.\n\nWinshill was a township in Burton ancient parish and later a [[civil parish]] covering 1,150 acres (4.65 km\u00b2). The southern part of the township, covering 607 acres (2.46 km\u00b2), was taken into Burton municipal borough on its extension in 1878, and under the [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Act]] of 1888 that area, then given as 642 acres (2.60 km\u00b2), was treated for municipal purposes as part of [[Staffordshire]]. It was wholly transferred to Staffordshire in 1894, when the remaining part of the township on the north and east sides of Dalebrook was added to the adjoining Derbyshire civil parish of [[Newton Solney]]. The area of the Winshill ward of [[East Staffordshire]] district was 452 acres (1.83 km\u00b2) in 1981. A boundary change of 1991 added land from the Derbyshire parishes of Newton Solney and [[Bretby]].\n\nThe actor [[Paddy Considine]] was brought up and went to school in Winshill. \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.burton2000.co.uk/index2.htm Burton2000]\n*[http://www.eaststaffsbc.gov.uk/ East Staffordshire Borough Council]\n*[http://www.burton-on-trent.org/1-History/Local%20Maps/Local%20Maps.htm Maps of Burton on Trent]\n*[http://www.burton-college.ac.uk Burton College]\n*[http://www.burton-on-trent.org/ Burton Grammar School]\n*[http://www.burton-on-trent.org/7-Links/High%20School/girls_high_school.htm Burton Girls High School]\n*[http://www.abbotbeyne.staffs.sch.uk/ Abbot Beyne Specialist Art College]\n{{Staffordshire-geo-stub}}\n[[Category:Villages in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:East Staffordshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2015}}\n{{infobox UK place|\n|country = England\n|coordinates = {{coord|52.8350|-1.6210|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name= Winshill\n|shire_district= [[East Staffordshire]]\n|shire_county=[[Staffordshire]]\n|region= West Midlands\n|constituency_westminster= [[Burton (UK Parliament constituency)|Burton]]\n|post_town= BURTON-ON-TRENT\n|postcode_district = DE14\n|postcode_area= DE\n|dial_code= 01283\n|os_grid_reference= SK267234\n|population= 8,466\n|population_ref = (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11130750&c=winshill&d=16&e=62&g=6463437&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1450018523036&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Winshill''' is an area to the east of the town of [[Burton upon Trent]], in the borough of [[East Staffordshire]], [[England]].\n\nFlanked to the north and east by the [[South Derbyshire]] border, historically the parish of Winshill had always been part of [[Derbyshire]] until it was transferred to [[Staffordshire]] in the late 19th century.\n\nAlong its southern flank runs the [[A511 road|A511]], known locally as the Ashby Road, from Bretby Lane and Moat Bank (Burton upon Trent's highest point) to the eastern end of the Trent Bridge and the junction with the [[A444 road|A444]].\n\nAlong its western flank are the [[River Trent]] and the [[B5008 road|B5008]] Newton Road, which runs to [[Newton Solney]] and [[Repton]] in [[South Derbyshire]].\n\nThe parish church in Winshill is [[St Mark's, Winshill|St Mark's]], part of the [[Diocese of Derby]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe name Winshill has its origin in [[Old English]] and means Wine's hill.<ref>Place-Names of Derbyshire iii (E.P.N.S. xxix), 669.</ref> There was a settlement here in the late 11th century when [[William I of England|William I]] installed privileged tenants at Winshill.  By this time there was a corn mill on the Winshill bank of the [[River Trent]], and in the 14th century a fulling mill \u2013 which became a cotton mill in the late 18th century -  was built on an island nearby. By the end of the 18th century the village was grouped around a green on the east side of the hill. The medieval Burton bridge crossed into Winshill at its east end, and the road to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] then followed a line along Bearwood Hill Road and High Bank Road. A tollgate was placed near the foot of Bearwood Hill Road when it became a turnpike road in 1753. The Ashby Road was put onto a more direct line in the later 1830s and the tollgate was placed near Moat Bank.\n\nWinshill was popular in the 19th century with prosperous citizens of Burton who built large houses like Bladon House, The Woodlands, Highfield House and Moat Bank on the higher ground overlooking the town. At the same time rows of houses were being built for brewery workers on Bearwood Hill, Ashby Road and Alexandra Road.

Her name frequently appears in contemporary inscriptions.'''{{Sfn|Teppo|2007|p=394}}''' At least one other daughter, though unnamed, is known from lists of the royal children and Serua-eterat is explicitly designated as the \"eldest daughter\", meaning there would have been other princesses.{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=119}} Because lists of the royal children are inconsistent in order, it is difficult to determine the age of Serua-eterat relative to her male siblings.'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|pp=172\u2013173}}''''' She is usually listed after the crown princes [[Ashurbanipal]] (who was set to inherit [[Assyria]]) and [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] (who was set to inherit [[Babylon]]) but ahead of the younger brothers [[Ashur-mukin-paleya]] and [[Ashur-etel-shame-erseti-muballissu]]. As such, she seems to have ranked third among the royal children, despite there being more than two sons.'''{{Sfn|Melville|2004|p=42}}''' She was older than Ashurbanipal and one theory in regards to her high status is that she might have been the oldest of Esarhaddon's children.'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|pp=172\u2013173}}'''''\n\nSerua-eterat's name is listed among the names of her brothers in a document concerning the foods and potential gifts of the New Year's celebration and she is also named in a grant by Ashurbanipal. She also appears in a medical report on the royal family from 669 BC.'''{{Sfn|Teppo|2007|p=395}}''' She is known to have performed sacrifices to the god [[Nabu]] together with the male children and to have been present at events and ceremonial banquets alongside her male siblings.{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=119}} She also appears in a text from the reign of Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal wherein Nabu-nadin-shumi, the chief [[exorcist]] in [[Babylonia]], writes to the princess to say that he is praying for her father and for her.'''{{Sfn|Teppo|2007|p=395}}'''\n\nShe might have been the daughter of Esarhaddon who was intended to marry [[Bartatua]], a [[Scythians|Scythian]] king, but this marriage probably never took place'''{{Sfn|Teppo|2007|p=395}}''' and she was still living in the royal palace at [[Nineveh]] {{Circa|}} 670 BC, near the end of Esarhaddon's reign. It was around this time that she wrote to her sister-in-law [[Libbali-sharrat]], wife of her brother, the crown prince Ashurbanipal. In her letter, she respectfully reprimands Libbali-sharrat for not studying and also reminds her that though Libbali-sharrat is to become the future queen, Serua-eterat still outranks her as she is the king's daughter (a title that would have been rendered as ''marat \u0161arri'', \"daughter of the king\", in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) whilst Libbali-\u0161arrat is only the king's daughter-in-law.'''{{Sfn|Teppo|2007|p=394}}''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|pp=172\u2013173}}''{{Sfn|Melville|2004|p=42}}''' Translated into English, Serua-eterat's letter reads:{{Sfn|Barjamovic|2011|p=|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n{{Quote| quote = Word of the king's daughter to Libbali-\u0161arrat.<br />Why don't you write your tablet and do your homework?
