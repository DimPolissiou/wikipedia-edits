He is a former competitor in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]]. He is the uncle of current driver [[Todd Peck]].\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania]], Peck drove the #89 Pontiac in two races in 1984 in the [[Busch Grand National Series]], but failed to finish either race.  In 1988 he ran the #96 Thomas Chevy sponsored Olds in 6 races with a best finish of 9th at [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]].\n\nThe next year he piloted the #96 again in 28 races and posted 7 top tens and was 10th in points.  In 1990 he made 31 starts and had 12 top tens and finished a career best 5th in the points.  The next year he got 1 more top ten but fell in the points to 9th.  In 1992 he switched to the #19 [[Levin Racing]] Olds with 7 top tens.\n\nAfter the third race of the 1993 season Peck was third in the point standings with [[S-K Hand Tools]] and [[Delco Remy]] sponsoring the #19 car. A series of accidents mid-season ended any hopes he had of a top 5 points finish. Tom would end the 1993 season with his 2nd consecutive 13th-place points finish.  In 1994, he got hired  to drive #31 [[Channellock]] Chevy which Steve Grissom won the championship with the previous year. This was the dream ride Peck had been waiting for and set his sights on winning the 1994 Busch Series Championship. This opportunity only lasted a couple months as before the race at Rougemont Peck was released from his ride. The next year he made his final 3 career starts in the #18 Ford and #67 Chevy.\n\nPeck's final appearance in the Busch Series was at [[Nazareth Speedway]] in 1996, where he qualified the No. 64 Chevrolet for [[Shoemaker Racing]]'s regular driver, [[Dick Trickle]], Trickle being at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] for the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race|1996 Winston Select]]. He qualified the car 29th, and was replaced by Trickle for the race;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/notebook-95-05-17/|title=Notebook 95-05-17|last=Corpus|first=Ken|work=Motorsport.com|accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref> Peck has not competed in NASCAR competition since.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

He is a former competitor in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]]. He is the uncle of current driver [[Todd Peck]]\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania]], Peck drove the #89 Pontiac in two races in 1984 in the [[Busch Grand National Series]], but failed to finish either race.  In 1988 he ran the #96 Thomas Chevy sponsored Olds in 6 races with a best finish of 9th at [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]].\n\nThe next year he piloted the #96 again in 28 races and posted 7 top tens and was 10th in points.  In 1990 he made 31 starts and had 12 top tens and finished a career best 5th in the points.  The next year he got 1 more top ten but fell in the points to 9th.  In 1992 he switched to the #19 [[Levin Racing]] Olds with 7 top tens.\n\nAfter the third race of the 1993 season Peck was third in the point standings with [[S-K Hand Tools]] and [[Delco Remy]] sponsoring the #19 car. A series of accidents mid-season ended any hopes he had of a top 5 points finish. Tom would end the 1993 season with his 2nd consecutive 13th-place points finish.  In 1994, he got hired  to drive #31 [[Channellock]] Chevy which Steve Grissom won the championship with the previous year. This was the dream ride Peck had been waiting for and set his sights on winning the 1994 Busch Series Championship. This opportunity only lasted a couple months as before the race at Rougemont Peck was released from his ride. The next year he made his final 3 career starts in the #18 Ford and #67 Chevy.\n\nPeck's final appearance in the Busch Series was at [[Nazareth Speedway]] in 1996, where he qualified the No. 64 Chevrolet for [[Shoemaker Racing]]'s regular driver, [[Dick Trickle]], Trickle being at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] for the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race|1996 Winston Select]]. He qualified the car 29th, and was replaced by Trickle for the race;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/notebook-95-05-17/|title=Notebook 95-05-17|last=Corpus|first=Ken|work=Motorsport.com|accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref> Peck has not competed in NASCAR competition since.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Iverson graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] with her Medical Doctorate degree. After a few years of medical work, she became a medical missionary at the Arabian Mission. Marrying Dr. Arthur King Bennett in 191, they relocated to [[Basra|Busrah]], Arabia where the couple continued missionary work at the Lansing Memorial Hospital. She was known for her impact on treating large numbers of patients, both at the Lansing Hospital and in the surrounding area. Additionally, when [[World War I]] limited her travel, Iverson began using the hospital specifically to treat wounded soldiers. In 1916, an outbreak of typhoid fever occurred and, while treating infected individuals, she contracted [[typhoid fever]], resulting in her death at age 35 in 1916.\n\n== Early life ==\nAnna Christine Iverson was born on January 4, 1881 in [[Denmark]].

Iverson graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] with her Medical Doctorate degree. After a few years of medical work, she became a medical missionary at the Arabian Mission. Marrying Dr. Arthur King Bennett in 191, they relocated to [[Basra|Busrah]], Arabia where the couple continued missionary work at the Lansing Memorial Hospital. She was known for her impact on treating large numbers of patients, both at the Lansing Hospital and in the surrounding area. Additionally, when [[World War I]] limited her travel, Iverson began using the hospital specifically to treat wounded soldiers. In 1916, an outbreak of typhoid fever occurred and, while treating infected individuals, she contracted [[typhoid fever]], resulting in her death at age 35 in 1916.\n\n== Early Life ==\nAnna Christine Iverson was born on January 4, 1881 in [[Denmark]].

At a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vue\u2019s compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined options.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html |title = Components \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\nThe code snippet below contains an example of a Vue component. The component presents a button and prints the number of times the button is clicked:\n{{syntaxhighlight|lang=html|code=\n<div id=\"tuto\">\n\t<button-clicked v-bind:initial-count=\"0\"></button-clicked>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nVue.component('button-clicked', {\n  props: [ \"initialCount\" ],\n  data: () => ({\n    count: 0,\n  }),\n  template: `<button v-on:click=\"onClick\">Clicked <nowiki>{{ count }}</nowiki> times</button>`,\n  computed: {\n    countTimesTwo() {\n      return this.count * 2;\n    }\n  },\n  watch: {\n    count(newValue, oldValue) {\n      console.log(`The value of count is changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}.`);\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    onClick() {\n        this.count += 1;\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.count = this.initialCount;\n  }\n});\n\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#tuto',\n});\n</script>\n}}\n\n=== Templates ===\nVue uses an [[HTML]]-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered [[Document Object Model|DOM]] to the underlying Vue instance's data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML [[Parsing|parsers]]. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions. A virtual Document Object Model (or \u201cDOM\u201d) allows Vue to render components in its memory before updating the browser. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to calculate the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.\n\nVue users can use template syntax or choose to directly write render functions using [[React (JavaScript library)#JSX|JSX]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html |title = Template Syntax \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref> Render functions allow application to be built from [[software components]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8#77d9 |title = Vue 2.0 is Here! |last =  |first =  |date = September 30, 2016 |website = The Vue Point |access-date = 2017-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n=== Reactivity ===\nVue features a reactivity system that uses plain [[JavaScript]] objects and optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to re-render, and which components to re-render.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html |title = Reactivity in Depth \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n=== Transitions ===\nVue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the [[Document Object Model|DOM]]. This includes tools to:\n* Automatically apply classes for [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] transitions and animations\n* Integrate third-party CSS animation libraries, such as Animate.css\n* Use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks\n* Integrate third-party JavaScript animation libraries, such as [[Velocity (JavaScript library)|Velocity.js]]\n\nWhen an element wrapped in a transition component is inserted or removed, this is what happens:\n# Vue will automatically sniff whether the target element has CSS transitions or animations applied. If it does, CSS transition classes will be added/removed at appropriate timings.\n# If the transition component provided JavaScript hooks, these hooks will be called at appropriate timings.\n# If no CSS transitions/animations are detected and no JavaScript hooks are provided, the DOM operations for insertion and/or removal will be executed immediately on next frame.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html |title = Transition Effects \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitioning-state.html |title = Transitioning State \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n=== Routing ===\nA traditional disadvantage of [[Single-page application|single-page applications]] (SPAs) is the inability to share links to the exact \"sub\" page within a specific web page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue),  bookmarking certain screens or sharing links to specific sections is normally difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit their dynamic URLs with a \"hashbang\" (#!), e.g. ''page.com/#!/''. However, with HTML5 most modern browsers support routing without hashbangs. \n\nVue provides an interface to change what is displayed on the page based on the current URL path -- regardless of how it was changed (whether by emailed link, refresh, or in-page links). Additionally, using a front-end router allows for the intentional transition of the browser path when certain browser events (i.e. clicks) occur on buttons or links. Vue itself doesn\u2019t come with front-end hashed routing. But the open source \"vue-router\" package provides an API to update the application's URL, supports the back button (navigating history), and email password resets or email verification links with authentication URL parameters. It supports mapping nested routes to nested components and offers fine-grained transition control. With Vue, developers are already composing applications with small building blocks building larger components. With vue-router added to the mix, components must merely be mapped to the routes they belong to, and parent/root routes must indicate where children should render.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/routing.html |title = Routing \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n{{syntaxhighlight|lang=html|code=\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <router-view></router-view>\n</div>\n...\n\n<script>\n...\nconst User = {\n  template: '<div>User <nowiki>{{ $route.params.id }}</nowiki></div>'\n}\n\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n  routes: [\n    { path: '/user/:id', component: User }\n  ]\n})\n...\n</script>\n}}\nThe code above:\n# Sets a front-end route at <code>websitename.com/user/<id></code>.\n# Which will render in the User component defined in (const User...)\n# Allows the User component to pass in the particular id of the user which was typed into the URL using the $route object's params key: <code>$route.params.id</code>.\n# This template (varying by the params passed into the router) will be rendered into <code><router-view></router-view></code> inside the DOM's div#app.\n# The finally generated HTML for someone typing in: <code>websitename.com/user/1</code> will be:\n{{syntaxhighlight|lang=html|code=\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <div>\n    <div>User 1</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n}}\n<ref>{{cite web |last1 = You |first1 = Evan |title = Vue Nested Routing (2) |url = https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/nested-routes.html |website = Vue Home Page (subpage) |accessdate = May 10, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== Ecosystem ==\nThe core library comes with tools and libraries both developed by the core team and contributors. \n\n=== Official Tooling ===\n* '''Devtools''' - Browser devtools extension for debugging Vue.js applications\n* '''Vue CLI''' - Standard Tooling for rapid Vue.js development \n* '''Vue Loader''' - a webpack loader that allows the writing of Vue components in a format called Single-File Components (SFCs)\n\n=== Official Libraries ===\n* '''Vue Router''' - The official router for Vue.js\n* '''Vuex''' - Flux-inspired Centralized State Management for Vue.js\n* '''Vue Server Renderer''' - Server-Side Rendering for Vue.js\n\n== Vue.js Conferences ==\n\nThe first Vue.js Conference was organized in 2017 by Polish software development company Monterail and Evan You.

The component presents a button and prints the number of times the button is clicked:\n{{syntaxhighlight|lang=html|code=\n<div id=\"tuto\">\n\t<button-clicked v-bind:initial-count=\"0\"></button-clicked>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nVue.component('button-clicked', {\n  props: [ \"initialCount\" ],\n  data: () => ({\n    count: 0,\n  }),\n  template: `<button v-on:click=\"onClick\">Clicked <nowiki>{{ count }}</nowiki> times</button>`,\n  computed: {\n    countTimesTwo() {\n      return this.count * 2;\n    }\n  },\n  watch: {\n    count(newValue, oldValue) {\n      console.log(`The value of count is changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}.`);\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    onClick() {\n        this.count += 1;\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.count = this.initialCount;\n  }\n});\n\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#tuto',\n});\n</script>\n}}\n\n=== Templates ===\nVue uses an [[HTML]]-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered [[Document Object Model|DOM]] to the underlying Vue instance's data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML [[Parsing|parsers]]. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions. A virtual Document Object Model (or \u201cDOM\u201d) allows Vue to render components in its memory before updating the browser. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to calculate the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.\n\nVue users can use template syntax or choose to directly write render functions using [[React (JavaScript library)#JSX|JSX]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html |title = Template Syntax \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref> Render functions allow application to be built from [[software components]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8#77d9 |title = Vue 2.0 is Here! |last =  |first =  |date = September 30, 2016 |website = The Vue Point |access-date = 2017-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n=== Reactivity ===\nVue features a reactivity system that uses plain [[JavaScript]] objects and optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to re-render, and which components to re-render.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html |title = Reactivity in Depth \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n=== Transitions ===\nVue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the [[Document Object Model|DOM]]. This includes tools to:\n* Automatically apply classes for [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] transitions and animations\n* Integrate third-party CSS animation libraries, such as Animate.css\n* Use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks\n* Integrate third-party JavaScript animation libraries, such as [[Velocity (JavaScript library)|Velocity.js]]\n\nWhen an element wrapped in a transition component is inserted or removed, this is what happens:\n# Vue will automatically sniff whether the target element has CSS transitions or animations applied. If it does, CSS transition classes will be added/removed at appropriate timings.\n# If the transition component provided JavaScript hooks, these hooks will be called at appropriate timings.\n# If no CSS transitions/animations are detected and no JavaScript hooks are provided, the DOM operations for insertion and/or removal will be executed immediately on next frame.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html |title = Transition Effects \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitioning-state.html |title = Transitioning State \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n=== Routing ===\nA traditional disadvantage of [[Single-page application|single-page applications]] (SPAs) is the inability to share links to the exact \"sub\" page within a specific web page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue),  bookmarking certain screens or sharing links to specific sections is normally difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit their dynamic URLs with a \"hashbang\" (#!), e.g. ''page.com/#!/''. However, with HTML5 most modern browsers support routing without hashbangs. \n\nVue provides an interface to change what is displayed on the page based on the current URL path -- regardless of how it was changed (whether by emailed link, refresh, or in-page links). Additionally, using a front-end router allows for the intentional transition of the browser path when certain browser events (i.e. clicks) occur on buttons or links. Vue itself doesn\u2019t come with front-end hashed routing. But the open source \"vue-router\" package provides an API to update the application's URL, supports the back button (navigating history), and email password resets or email verification links with authentication URL parameters. It supports mapping nested routes to nested components and offers fine-grained transition control. With Vue, developers are already composing applications with small building blocks building larger components. With vue-router added to the mix, components must merely be mapped to the routes they belong to, and parent/root routes must indicate where children should render.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/routing.html |title = Routing \u2014 Vue.js |access-date = March 11, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n{{syntaxhighlight|lang=html|code=\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <router-view></router-view>\n</div>\n...\n\n<script>\n...\nconst User = {\n  template: '<div>User <nowiki>{{ $route.params.id }}</nowiki></div>'\n}\n\nconst router = new VueRouter({\n  routes: [\n    { path: '/user/:id', component: User }\n  ]\n})\n...\n</script>\n}}\nThe code above:\n# Sets a front-end route at <code>websitename.com/user/<id></code>.\n# Which will render in the User component defined in (const User...)\n# Allows the User component to pass in the particular id of the user which was typed into the URL using the $route object's params key: <code>$route.params.id</code>.\n# This template (varying by the params passed into the router) will be rendered into <code><router-view></router-view></code> inside the DOM's div#app.\n# The finally generated HTML for someone typing in: <code>websitename.com/user/1</code> will be:\n{{syntaxhighlight|lang=html|code=\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <div>\n    <div>User 1</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n}}\n<ref>{{cite web |last1 = You |first1 = Evan |title = Vue Nested Routing (2) |url = https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/nested-routes.html |website = Vue Home Page (subpage) |accessdate = May 10, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== Ecosystem ==\nThe core library comes with tools and libraries both developed by the core team and contributors. \n\n=== Official Tooling ===\n* '''Devtools''' - Browser devtools extension for debugging Vue.js applications\n* '''Vue CLI''' - Standard Tooling for rapid Vue.js development \n* '''Vue Loader''' - a webpack loader that allows the writing of Vue components in a format called Single-File Components (SFCs)\n\n=== Official Libraries ===\n* '''Vue Router''' - The official router for Vue.js\n* '''Vuex''' - Flux-inspired Centralized State Management for Vue.js\n* '''Vue Server Renderer''' - Server-Side Rendering for Vue.js\n\n== Vue.js Conferences ==\n\nThe first Vue.js Conference was organized in 2017 by Polish software development company Monterail and Evan You.
