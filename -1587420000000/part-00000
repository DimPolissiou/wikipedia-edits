It was established in 1906<ref name=uaf>http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016</ref> as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].\n\nAt independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.\n\nThe 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.\n\nUAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] \n\nThe university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 15,000 students and approximately 12,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Hailey Hall]].\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n===Faculties and departments===\nUAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences. A community college is on the main [[campus]] in [[Faisalabad]]. The College of Veterinary Sciences at [[Lahore]] was affiliated and is now a distinct entity known as the [[University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences|University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore]] (UVAS).\n\nThese units offer programmes leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in agriculture and allied fields. [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] ranks the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad as the best in the agriculture/veterinary field in Pakistan. The University of Agriculture [[Faisalabad]] ranked number 4 among the top 10 universities in [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Documents/Ranking_Doc%20(2015).pdf | title=Ranking 2015- Overall Top 10 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) | date=23 February 2016 | publisher=[[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] | location=Pakistan | accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Faculty of Agriculture====\n\nThe Faculty of Agriculture comprises\n\n* Six departments \u2014 Agronomy, Plant Breeding and Genetics, Agricultural Entomology, Plant Pathology, Crop Physiology and Forestry, Wildlife & Range Management\n* Three institutes \u2014 Institute of Soil & Environmental Sciences, and Institute of Horticultural Sciences and National Institute of Food Science and Technology.\n* Seven allied disciplines \u2014 Agricultural Economics, Marketing & Agribusiness, Agricultural Extension, Animal Sciences, Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics\n* One centre \u2014 Centre of Agricultural Biochemistry and Biotechnology (CABB)\nA building called the U.S. Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Agriculture and Food Security (USPCAS) is constructed with the collaboration of USA for food security and research purposes.\n[[File:University old building.jpg|thumb|]]\n\n[[File:UAF..jpg|thumb|Old Building (since 1906) before independence]]\n\n====Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology====\n\nThe faculty includes the departments of [[Structural engineering|Structural]] and [[Environmental Engineering]], [[Irrigation and Drainage]], [[Food Engineering]], [[Agricultural machinery|Farm Machinery, and Power]] and Fibre Technology.

It was established in 1906<ref name=uaf>http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016</ref> as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].\n\nAt independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.\n\nThe 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.\n\nUAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] \n\nThe university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 15,000 students and approximately 12,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Hailey Hall]].\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n===Faculties and departments===\nUAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences. A community college is on the main [[campus]] in [[Faisalabad]]. The College of Veterinary Sciences at [[Lahore]] was affiliated and is now a distinct entity known as the [[University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences|University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore]] (UVAS).\n\nThese units offer programmes leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in agriculture and allied fields. [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] ranks the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad as the best in the agriculture/veterinary field in Pakistan.

Harris was again re-elected in Nipissing without difficulty.<ref name=\"1987 Election Results\">{{cite news |title=Results from individual ridings |newspaper=The Windsor Star |date=September 11, 1987 |page=F2}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership (1990)==\nThe party was not ready to hold a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership elections|leadership convention]] in 1987.  Grossman, who had lost his legislative seat, remained the official leader of the party until 1990 while Sarnia MPP [[Andy Brandt]] served as \"interim leader\" in the legislature.  Harris was chosen as PC house leader, and had become the party's dominant voice in the legislature by 1989. Harris entered the [[1990 Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election|1990 leadership race]], and defeated [[Dianne Cunningham]] in a province-wide vote to replace Grossman as the party's official leader.\n\nThe [[1990 Ontario general election|1990 provincial election]] was called soon after Harris became party leader.  With help from past leader [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]], Harris managed to rally his party's core supporters with pledges of tax cuts and spending reductions.  Due to his teaching background, Harris was personally endorsed by several local members of the [[Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation]] (OSSTF). The election was won by [[Bob Rae]]'s [[New Democratic Party|NDP]].  The Conservatives increased their seat total from 17 to 20 out of 130. Despite some early concerns, Harris was again able to retain his own seat.\n\n==1995 election==\nOn 3 May 1994, Harris unveiled his \"[[Common Sense Revolution]]\" platform. It called for significant spending and tax cuts, as well as elimination of the province's record $11 billion deficit.<ref name=\"LindquistCanada2000\">{{cite book|author1=Evert A.

[[Lyn McLeod]]'s Liberals were leading in pre-election polls and were expected to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP, but they began losing support due to several controversial policy reversals and what was generally regarded as an uninspiring campaign.<ref>https://archive.macleans.ca/issue/19950619</ref> The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris's performance in the televised leaders' debate. Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey his party's [[Common Sense Revolution]] platform. The Rae government had previously lost much of its base in organized labour, due in part to the unpopularity of its \"[[Social Contract (Ontario)|Social Contract]]\" legislation in 1993 (which Harris, after some initial vacillations, eventually voted against).<ref name=\"Gidney1999\">{{cite book|author=Robert Douglas Gidney|title=From Hope to Harris: The Reshaping of Ontario's Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9Ct67DdWYIC&pg=PA165|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8125-4|pages=165\u2013}}</ref> Harris's opposition to Rae's [[affirmative action]] measures helped him to capture some unionized-worker support during the election, particularly among male workers.\n\nAlthough there were regional variations, many union voters shifted from the NDP to the Tories in 1995 (instead of to the Liberals as expected pre-campaign), enabling the Tories to win a number of new ridings, such as [[Cambridge (provincial electoral district)|Cambridge]] and [[Oshawa (provincial electoral district)|Oshawa]], which had long supported the NDP.<ref>Mallan, Caroline. \"The legacy of Mike Harris\".

In addition, a new Fair Share Health Levy was established and charged to high-income earners to help pay for mounting health care costs.\n\nShortly after assuming office, the Harris government announced that several hundred nurses would be laid off to cut costs in the health sector.  The government also implemented a series of hospital closures on the recommendations of a Health Services Restructuring Commission.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Harris compared the laid off hospital workers to the people who lost their jobs after the [[hula hoop]] fad died down in the early 1960s, commenting \"Just as Hula-Hoops went out and those workers had to have a factory and a company that would manufacture something else that's in, it's the same in government, and you know, governments have put off these decisions for so many years that restructuring sometimes is painful\" (''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 6 March 1997).\n\nThe Harris government cut funding of major urban infrastructure projects upon assuming office. Though construction had already begun on the [[Eglinton West line|Eglinton West subway]] in Toronto, a proposed rapid transit line to ultimately link the main north/south subway line of the city with the suburbs and airport, funding was cancelled shortly after Harris's election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5112.shtml |title=The Eglinton West Subway |publisher=Transit Toronto |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\nHarris's government also cut health spending to counter the $30&nbsp;billion cut in transfer payments from the Liberal federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cupe.ca/health-care/BE4555 |title=Health Care &#124; Canadian Union of Public Employees |website=Cupe.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-04-10}}</ref> It also introduced Telehealth Ontario, a 24-hour toll-free telephone help line with live connection to registered nurses. Harris also announced funding vehicles such as the Ontario R&D Challenge Fund, the Ontario Innovation Trust and the Premier's Research Excellence Awards.\n\nOne part of the Common Sense Revolution was to sell off various government-owned enterprises, the largest of which were to be [[Ontario Hydro]] and the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]].  Neither was actually sold off, but Ontario Hydro was split into five successor companies (the two largest being [[Ontario Power Generation]] and [[Hydro One]], representing generation and distribution of power respectively) with the plan of eventually selling them off. Public opposition to the sale of these money-making government enterprises postponed the government's plans. In 1999, [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] was leased to a private consortium.<ref name=\"logospathosethos.com\"/>\n\nHarris reduced the number of [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|MPPs]] from 130 to 103 by redrawing riding boundaries to correspond to federal electoral districts.<ref name=ce />\n\nThe Harris government passed Bill 26, the Savings and Restructuring Act, which undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002.

After the end of his first marriage, he enrolled at [[Laurentian University]] and [[North Bay Teacher's College]] where he received his teaching certificate. He was employed as an elementary school teacher at W. J.

Grossman, who had lost his legislative seat, remained the official leader of the party until 1990 while Sarnia MPP [[Andy Brandt]] served as \"interim leader\" in the legislature.  Harris was chosen as PC house leader, and had become the party's dominant voice in the legislature by 1989. Harris entered the [[1990 Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election|1990 leadership race]], and defeated [[Dianne Cunningham]] in a province-wide vote to replace Grossman as the party's official leader.\n\nThe [[1990 Ontario general election|1990 provincial election]] was called soon after Harris became party leader.  With help from past leader [[Larry Grossman (politician)|Larry Grossman]], Harris managed to rally his party's core supporters with pledges of tax cuts and spending reductions.  Due to his teaching background, Harris was personally endorsed by several local members of the [[Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation]] (OSSTF). The election was won by [[Bob Rae]]'s [[New Democratic Party|NDP]].  The Conservatives increased their seat total from 17 to 20 out of 130. Despite some early concerns, Harris was again able to retain his own seat.\n\n==1995 election==\nOn 3 May 1994, Harris unveiled his \"[[Common Sense Revolution]]\" platform. It called for significant spending and tax cuts, as well as elimination of the province's record $11 billion deficit.<ref name=\"LindquistCanada2000\">{{cite book|author1=Evert A.

[[Lyn McLeod]]'s Liberals were leading in pre-election polls and were expected to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP, but they began losing support due to several controversial policy reversals and what was generally regarded as an uninspiring campaign.<ref>https://archive.macleans.ca/issue/19950619</ref> The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris's performance in the televised leaders' debate. Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey his party's [[Common Sense Revolution]] platform. The Rae government had previously lost much of its base in organized labour, due in part to the unpopularity of its \"[[Social Contract (Ontario)|Social Contract]]\" legislation in 1993 (which Harris, after some initial vacillations, eventually voted against).<ref name=\"Gidney1999\">{{cite book|author=Robert Douglas Gidney|title=From Hope to Harris: The Reshaping of Ontario's Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9Ct67DdWYIC&pg=PA165|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8125-4|pages=165\u2013}}</ref> Harris's opposition to Rae's [[affirmative action]] measures helped him to capture some unionized-worker support during the election, particularly among male workers.\n\nAlthough there were regional variations, many union voters shifted from the NDP to the Tories in 1995 (instead of to the Liberals as expected pre-campaign), enabling the Tories to win a number of new ridings, such as [[Cambridge (provincial electoral district)|Cambridge]] and [[Oshawa (provincial electoral district)|Oshawa]], which had long supported the NDP.<ref>Mallan, Caroline. \"The legacy of Mike Harris\".

In addition, a new Fair Share Health Levy was established and charged to high-income earners to help pay for mounting health care costs.\n\nShortly after assuming office, the Harris government announced that several hundred nurses would be laid off to cut costs in the health sector.  The government also implemented a series of hospital closures on the recommendations of a Health Services Restructuring Commission.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Harris compared the laid off hospital workers to the people who lost their jobs after the [[hula hoop]] fad died down in the early 1960s, commenting \"Just as Hula-Hoops went out and those workers had to have a factory and a company that would manufacture something else that's in, it's the same in government, and you know, governments have put off these decisions for so many years that restructuring sometimes is painful\" (''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 6 March 1997).\n\nThe Harris government cut funding of major urban infrastructure projects upon assuming office. Though construction had already begun on the [[Eglinton West line|Eglinton West subway]] in Toronto, a proposed rapid transit line to ultimately link the main north/south subway line of the city with the suburbs and airport, funding was cancelled shortly after Harris's election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5112.shtml |title=The Eglinton West Subway |publisher=Transit Toronto |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\nHarris's government also cut health spending to counter the $30&nbsp;billion cut in transfer payments from the Liberal federal government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cupe.ca/health-care/BE4555 |title=Health Care &#124; Canadian Union of Public Employees |website=Cupe.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-04-10}}</ref> It also introduced Telehealth Ontario, a 24-hour toll-free telephone help line with live connection to registered nurses. Harris also announced funding vehicles such as the Ontario R&D Challenge Fund, the Ontario Innovation Trust and the Premier's Research Excellence Awards.\n\nOne part of the Common Sense Revolution was to sell off various government-owned enterprises, the largest of which were to be [[Ontario Hydro]] and the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]].  Neither was actually sold off, but Ontario Hydro was split into five successor companies (the two largest being [[Ontario Power Generation]] and [[Hydro One]], representing generation and distribution of power respectively) with the plan of eventually selling them off. Public opposition to the sale of these money-making government enterprises postponed the government's plans. In 1999, [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] was leased to a private consortium.<ref name=\"logospathosethos.com\"/>\n\nHarris reduced the number of [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|MPPs]] from 130 to 103 by redrawing riding boundaries to correspond to federal electoral districts.<ref name=ce />\n\nThe Harris government passed Bill 26, the Savings and Restructuring Act, which undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002.

It was the home ground of [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]]. Since 2011, it has also hosted matches of [[Top 14]] rugby team [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]].\n\nUntil 2001, the stadium's name was the '''Stade du Parc Lescure''', so called after the fallow lands on which it was built (Lescure is from earlier d'Escure, a transformation of \"des Cures,\" part of the name of the chapelle Saint-Laurent-des-Cures-l\u00e8s-Bourdeaus, formerly a prominent feature of the area).<ref>Guy Dupuis, ''Lescure: Stade Municipal de Bordeaux, Aujourd'hui stade Chaban-Delmas'' (Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine, 2008; {{ISBN|284622160X}}), p. 13.</ref> That year it was renamed after politician [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was the mayor of Bordeaux from 1947 to 1995.\n\nFirst built in 1930 as a cycle-racing track, in 1935 it was reconfigured to accommodate the upcoming [[1938 FIFA World Cup]]. Rebuilt by the architects Jacques d'Welles and Raoul Jourde in a [[Art d\u00e9co]] style, it was the first stadium in the world to have stands entirely covered without any pillars obstructing visibility of the playing area. Classified as a historic building, its restoration has been difficult, as its roof does not cover seats built after 1984 on the old cycle track.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Le Stade municipal de Bordeaux en 1938.jpg|In 1938\nFile:France, bordeaux, stade chaban delmas.jpg|2nd entrance\nFile:Bordeaux Stade Lescure 1938 Vases du c\u00e9ramiste Ren\u00e9 Buthaud.JPG|Vases by Ren\u00e9 Buthaud\n</gallery>\n\n\nThe current [[seating capacity]] of the stadium is 34,462, following a series of expansions of the stands, in particular for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. A record 40,211 spectators were in attendance on 24 April 1985 to watch a match between Girondins de Bordeaux and [[Juventus]].\nIn preparation of several matches that were held here for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], two giant television screens measuring 37 m<sup>2</sup> were installed.\n\nThe tunnel connecting the locker rooms of the players to the ground is the longest in Europe (close to 120 meters).\n\nOn 19 July 2011, FC Girondins de Bordeaux announced plans to construct a new stadium, located in Bordeaux-Lac, with seating capacity of 42,115 for sporting events. Construction of the [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] began in 2013 and ended in April 2015.\n\n==1938 FIFA World Cup==\nThe \"Council Stadium\" at the time accommodated two matches for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]]: a quarter final and the match for third place.
