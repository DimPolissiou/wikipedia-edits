Timoshenko, Strength of Materials, Part II, 2nd ed., 1941, Ch VIII, p. 362.</ref> is a nonlinear behavior particular to members made of [[ductile]] materials that frequently achieve much greater ultimate bending strength than indicated by a linear elastic bending analysis. In both the plastic and elastic bending analyses of a straight beam, it is assumed that the strain distribution is linear about the neutral axis (plane sections remain plane). In an elastic analysis this assumption leads to a linear stress distribution but in a plastic analysis the resulting stress distribution is nonlinear and is dependent on the beam\u2019s material.\n\nThe limiting '''plastic bending''' strength <math> M_r </math> (see [[Plastic moment]]) can generally be thought of as an upper limit to a beam\u2019s load\u2013carrying capability as it only represents the strength at a particular cross\u2013section and not the load\u2013carrying capability of the overall beam. A beam may fail due to global or local instability before <math> M_r </math> is reached at any point on its length. Therefore, beams should also be checked for local buckling, local crippling, and global lateral\u2013torsional buckling modes of failure.\n\n'''Note''' that the deflections necessary to develop the stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently to the point of incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the plastic range can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with plastic bending can significantly change the internal load distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams. The internal load distribution associated with the deformed shape and stiffness should be used for calculations.\n\n'''Plastic bending''' begins when an applied moment causes the outside fibers of a cross-section to exceed the material's yield strength. Loaded only by a moment, the peak bending [[Stress (physics)|stress]]es occurs at the outside fibers of a cross-section.  The cross-section will not yield linearly through the section. Rather, outside regions will yield first, redistributing stress and delaying failure beyond what would be predicted by elastic analytical methods. The stress distribution from the [[neutral axis]] is the same as the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material (this assumes a non-composite cross-section). After a cross-section reaches a sufficiently high condition of plastic bending, it acts as a [[Plastic hinge]].\n\nElementary Elastic Bending theory requires that the bending stress varies linearly with distance from the [[neutral axis]], but plastic bending shows a more accurate and complex stress distribution. The yielded areas of the cross-section will vary somewhere between the yield and ultimate strength of the material. In the elastic region of the cross-section, the stress distribution varies linearly from the neutral axis to the beginning of the yielded area. Predicted failure occurs when the stress distribution approximates the material's stress-strain curve.  The largest value being that of the ultimate strength.  Not every area of the cross-section will have exceeded the yield strength. \n\nAs in the basic Elastic Bending theory, the [[moment (physics)|moment]] at any section is equal to an [[area integral]] of bending stress across the cross-section. From this and the above additional assumptions, predictions of deflections and failure [[strength of materials|strength]] are made.\n\nPlastic theory was validated at the beginning of the last century by C. v.

The data is digitized, stored, and sent to the SETI@home facility. The data are then parsed into small chunks in frequency and time, and analyzed, using software, to search for any signals\u2014that is, variations which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. Using distributed computing, SETI@home sends the millions of chunks of data to be analyzed off-site by home computers, and then have those computers report the results. Thus what appears a difficult problem in data analysis is reduced to a reasonable one by aid from a large, Internet-based community of borrowed computer resources.\n\nThe software searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from [[Electromagnetic interference|noise]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/about_seti_at_home_4.html |title=How SETI@Home Works \u2013 What is SETI@home Looking For? |publisher=SETI@Home Classic |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>\n* Spikes in [[power spectrum|power spectra]]\n* [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam's [[main lobe]] passing over a radio source\n* Triplets&nbsp;\u2013 three power spikes in a row\n* [[Pulse (signal processing)|Pulsing]] signals that possibly represent a [[narrowband]] digital-style transmission\n* [[Autocorrelation]] detects signal waveforms.\n\nThere are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by the relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The potential \"signal\" is thus processed in many ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential \"signal.\" Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software.\n\nThe process is somewhat like tuning a radio to various [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]], and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly [[discrete Fourier transform]]s at various [[chirp]] rates and durations.\n\n==Results==\nTo date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|ETI]] signals. However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noisespots,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/candidates.html |title=Signal Candidate |publisher=Classic SETI@home |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> for further analysis. The most significant candidate signal to date was announced on September 1, 2004, named [[Radio source SHGb02+14a]].\n\nWhile the project has not reached the stated primary goal of finding extraterrestrial intelligence, it has proved to the scientific community that distributed computing projects using Internet-connected computers can succeed as a viable analysis tool, and even beat the largest supercomputers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/-1/project/detail |publisher=BOINCstats |title=BOINC combined \u2013 Credit overview |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}} However, it has not been demonstrated that the order of magnitude excess in computers used, many outside the home (the original intent was to use 50,000\u2013100,000 \"home\" computers),<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite web|url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/woody_paper.html |title=Sullivan, et al.: Seti@Home |publisher=Seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu |accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> has benefited the project scientifically.

This program was only capable of running SETI@home; it was replaced by [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC), which also allows users to contribute to other distributed computing projects at the same time as running SETI@home. The BOINC platform will also allow testing for more types of signals.\n\nThe discontinuation of the SETI@home Classic platform has rendered older [[Macintosh]] computers running the [[classic Mac OS]] unsuitable for participating in the project.\n\nSETI@home is available for the Sony [[PlayStation 3]] console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI@home%20applications.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108193313/http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI%40home%20applications.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-01-08|title=SETI@home applications}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2006, new work units for a new version of SETI@home called \"SETI@home Enhanced\" started distribution. Since computers now have the power for more computationally intensive work than when the project began, this new version is more sensitive by a factor of two concerning Gaussian signals and to some kinds of pulsed signals than the original SETI@home (BOINC) software. This new application has been optimized to the point where it will run faster on some work units than earlier versions. However, some work units (the best work units, scientifically speaking) will take significantly longer.\n\nIn addition, some distributions of the SETI@home applications have been optimized for a particular type of [[CPU]]. They are referred to as \"optimized executables\" and have been found to run faster on systems specific for that CPU. {{As of|2007}}, most of these applications were optimized for [[Intel]] processors and their corresponding [[instruction set]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lunatics.kwsn.net |title=Seti@Home optimized science apps and information |publisher=Lunatics.kwsn.net |access-date=17 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424210331/http://lunatics.kwsn.net/ |archive-date=April 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the data processing are normally automatically transmitted when the computer is next connected to the Internet; it can also be instructed to connect to the Internet as needed.\n\n==Statistics==\nWith over 5.2&nbsp;million participants worldwide, the project is the distributed computing project with the most participants to date{{when|date=March 2014}}.

Teams were formed to combine the efforts of individual users. The competition continued and grew larger with the introduction of BOINC.\n\nAs with any competition, attempts have been made to \"cheat\" the system and claim credit for work that has not been performed. To combat cheats, the SETI@home system sends every work unit to multiple computers, a value known as \"initial replication\" (currently '''2'''). Credit is only granted for each returned work unit once a minimum number of results have been returned and the results agree, a value known as \"minimum quorum\" (currently '''2'''). If, due to computation errors or cheating by submitting false data, not enough results agree, more identical work units are sent out until the minimum quorum can be reached. The final credit granted to all machines which returned the correct result is the same and is the lowest of the values claimed by each machine. \n\nSome users have installed and run SETI@home on computers at their workplaces&nbsp;\u2013 an act known as\n\"Borging\", after the assimilation-driven [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]''.

As in any project of prolonged duration, various factors may result in its termination. Some of these are detailed below:\n\n===Potential closure of Arecibo Observatory===\n\nAt present, SETI@home procures its data from the [[Arecibo Observatory]] facility operated by the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and administered by [[SRI International]].\n\nThe decreasing operating budget for the observatory has created a shortfall of funds which has not been made up from other sources such as private donors, [[NASA]], other foreign research institutions, nor private non-profit organizations such as SETI@home.\n\nHowever, in the overall longterm views held by many involved with the SETI project, any usable radio telescope could take over from Arecibo, as all the SETI systems are portable and relocatable.\n\n===Alternative distributed computing projects===\nWhen the project launched,<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/aliens-on-your-packard-bell/527445/</ref> there were few alternative ways of donating computer time to research projects. However, there are now [[List of distributed computing projects|many other projects]] that are competing for such time.{{quantify|date=May 2015}}\n\n===More restrictive computer use policies in businesses===\nIn one documented case, an individual was fired for explicitly importing and using the SETI@home software on computers used for the U.S. state of Ohio.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 9, 2004 |author=John Adams |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/databases/blog/2004/10/knock_down_then_kick.html |title=Knock Down, Then Kick \u2013 O'Reilly Databases |publisher=Oreillynet.com |accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> In another incident a school IT director resigned after his installation allegedly cost his school district $1&nbsp;million in removal costs; however, other reasons for this firing included lack of communication with his superiors, not installing [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] software and alleged theft of computer equipment,<ref>{{cite news |title=Higley firing tied to alien-search software |date=November 30, 2009 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/11/30/20091130searchforaliens1202.html}}</ref> leading a [[ZDNet]] editor to comment that \"the distributed computing nonsense was simply the best and most obvious excuse the district had to terminate his contract [[Dismissal (employment)#Reasons|with cause]]\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Christopher Dawson |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/admin-fired-for-incompetence-not-alien-search/3408 |title=Admin fired for incompetence, not alien search |work=ZDNet |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2005|10|16}}, approximately one-third of the processing for the non-BOINC version of the software was performed on work or school based machines.<ref>{{cite web | author = SETI@home |year = 2005 | url = http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/stats/venues.html | title = SETI@home computer venues | accessdate = 12 June 2006}}</ref> As many of these computers will give reduced privileges to ordinary users, it is possible that much of this has been done by [[network administrator]]s.\n\nTo some extent, this may be offset by [[Internet access#History|better connectivity to home machines]] and [[Moore's law|increasing performance]] of home computers,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} especially those with [[GPU]]s,<ref name=\"SETI_GPU\">{{Cite web\n |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=73935\n |title=SETI@home now supports Intel GPUs\n |date=January 29, 2014\n |accessdate=February 19, 2015\n}}</ref> which have also benefited other distributed computing projects such as [[Folding@Home]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.engadget.com/2006/09/29/stanford-university-tailors-folding-home-to-gpus/\n | title = Stanford University tailors Folding@home to GPUs\n | author = Darren Murph\n | accessdate = February 19, 2015\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mhouston/\n | title = Folding@Home \u2013 GPGPU\n | author = Mike Houston\n | accessdate = February 19, 2015\n}}</ref> The spread of [[mobile computing]] devices provides another large resource for distributed computing.

Berkeley Space Science Lab has found ways of working with small budgets, and the project has received donations allowing it to go well beyond its original planned duration, but it still has to compete for limited funds with other SETI projects and other space sciences projects.\n\nIn a December 16, 2007 plea for donations, SETI@home stated its present modest state and urged donations of $476,000 needed for continuation into 2008.\n\n===Unofficial clients===\nA number of individuals and companies made unofficial changes to the distributed part of the software to try to produce faster results, but this compromised the integrity of all the results.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The SETI@Home Problem | journal = Crossroads |year = 2000 | first = David | last = Molnar | volume = 7 | issue = 1| url = http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120715134754/http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 15 July 2012 | access-date = 30 January 2011}}</ref> As a result, the software had to be updated to make it easier to detect such changes, and discover unreliable clients. BOINC will run on unofficial clients; however, clients that return different and therefore incorrect data are not allowed, so corrupting the result database is avoided. BOINC relies on cross-checking to validate data<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SecurityIssues |title=SecurityIssues \u2013 BOINC \u2013 Trac |publisher=Boinc.berkeley.edu |accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> but unreliable clients need to be identified, to avoid situations when two of these report the same invalid data and therefore corrupt the database. A very popular unofficial client (lunatic) allows users to take advantage of the special features provided by their processor(s) such as [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], [[SSE3]], [[SSSE3]], [[SSE4]].1, and [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]] to allow for faster processing.\n\n===Hardware and database failures===\nSETI@home is a test bed for further development not only of BOINC but of other hardware and software (database) technology. Under SETI@home processing loads, these experimental technologies can be more challenging than expected, as SETI databases do not have typical accounting and business data or relational structures. The non-traditional database uses often do incur greater processing overheads and risk of database corruption and outright database failure.

Along with [[MilkyWay@home]] and [[Einstein@home]], it is the third major computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose.\nOn March 31 2020, the project stopped sending out new work to SETI@home users, bringing this particular SETI effort to an indefinite hiatus.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/science/seti-at-home-aliens.html|title=The Search for E.T.

The current [[BOINC]] environment, a development of the original SETI@home, is providing support for many computationally intensive projects in a wide range of disciplines.\n\nThe first of these goals has to date yielded no conclusive results: no evidence for ETI signals has been shown via SETI@home. However, the ongoing continuation is predicated on the assumption that the observational analysis is not \"ill-posed.\" The remainder of this article deals specifically with the original SETI@home observations/analysis. The vast majority of the sky (over 98%) has yet to be surveyed, and each point in the sky must be surveyed many times to exclude even a subset of possibilities.\n\n==Procedure details==\nSETI@home searches for possible evidence of radio transmissions from [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] using observational data from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] and the [[Green Bank Telescope]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/research.html|title=Berkeley SETI|website=seti.berkeley.edu|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref> The data is taken \"piggyback\" or \"passively\" while the telescope is used for other scientific programs. The data is digitized, stored, and sent to the SETI@home facility. The data are then parsed into small chunks in frequency and time, and analyzed, using software, to search for any signals\u2014that is, variations which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. Using distributed computing, SETI@home sends the millions of chunks of data to be analyzed off-site by home computers, and then have those computers report the results. Thus what appears a difficult problem in data analysis is reduced to a reasonable one by aid from a large, Internet-based community of borrowed computer resources.\n\nThe software searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from [[Electromagnetic interference|noise]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/about_seti/about_seti_at_home_4.html |title=How SETI@Home Works \u2013 What is SETI@home Looking For? |publisher=SETI@Home Classic |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>\n* Spikes in [[power spectrum|power spectra]]\n* [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam's [[main lobe]] passing over a radio source\n* Triplets&nbsp;\u2013 three power spikes in a row\n* [[Pulse (signal processing)|Pulsing]] signals that possibly represent a [[narrowband]] digital-style transmission\n* [[Autocorrelation]] detects signal waveforms.\n\nThere are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by the relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The potential \"signal\" is thus processed in many ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential \"signal.\" Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software.\n\nThe process is somewhat like tuning a radio to various [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]], and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly [[discrete Fourier transform]]s at various [[chirp]] rates and durations.\n\n==Results==\nTo date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|ETI]] signals. However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noisespots,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/candidates.html |title=Signal Candidate |publisher=Classic SETI@home |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> for further analysis. The most significant candidate signal to date was announced on September 1, 2004, named [[Radio source SHGb02+14a]].\n\nWhile the project has not reached the stated primary goal of finding extraterrestrial intelligence, it has proved to the scientific community that distributed computing projects using Internet-connected computers can succeed as a viable analysis tool, and even beat the largest supercomputers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/-1/project/detail |publisher=BOINCstats |title=BOINC combined \u2013 Credit overview |accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}} However, it has not been demonstrated that the order of magnitude excess in computers used, many outside the home (the original intent was to use 50,000\u2013100,000 \"home\" computers),<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite web|url=http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/woody_paper.html |title=Sullivan, et al.: Seti@Home |publisher=Seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu |accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> has benefited the project scientifically.

This program was only capable of running SETI@home; it was replaced by [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC), which also allows users to contribute to other distributed computing projects at the same time as running SETI@home. The BOINC platform will also allow testing for more types of signals.\n\nThe discontinuation of the SETI@home Classic platform has rendered older [[Macintosh]] computers running the [[classic Mac OS]] unsuitable for participating in the project.\n\nSETI@home is available for the Sony [[PlayStation 3]] console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI@home%20applications.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108193313/http://www.dotsch.de/boinc/SETI%40home%20applications.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-01-08|title=SETI@home applications}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2006, new work units for a new version of SETI@home called \"SETI@home Enhanced\" started distribution.

This new application has been optimized to the point where it will run faster on some work units than earlier versions. However, some work units (the best work units, scientifically speaking) will take significantly longer.\n\nIn addition, some distributions of the SETI@home applications have been optimized for a particular type of [[CPU]]. They are referred to as \"optimized executables\" and have been found to run faster on systems specific for that CPU. {{As of|2007}}, most of these applications were optimized for [[Intel]] processors and their corresponding [[instruction set]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lunatics.kwsn.net |title=Seti@Home optimized science apps and information |publisher=Lunatics.kwsn.net |access-date=17 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424210331/http://lunatics.kwsn.net/ |archive-date=April 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the data processing are normally automatically transmitted when the computer is next connected to the Internet; it can also be instructed to connect to the Internet as needed.\n\n==Statistics==\nWith over 5.2&nbsp;million participants worldwide, the project is the distributed computing project with the most participants to date{{when|date=March 2014}}.

Teams were formed to combine the efforts of individual users. The competition continued and grew larger with the introduction of BOINC.\n\nAs with any competition, attempts have been made to \"cheat\" the system and claim credit for work that has not been performed. To combat cheats, the SETI@home system sends every work unit to multiple computers, a value known as \"initial replication\" (currently '''2'''). Credit is only granted for each returned work unit once a minimum number of results have been returned and the results agree, a value known as \"minimum quorum\" (currently '''2'''). If, due to computation errors or cheating by submitting false data, not enough results agree, more identical work units are sent out until the minimum quorum can be reached. The final credit granted to all machines which returned the correct result is the same and is the lowest of the values claimed by each machine. \n\nSome users have installed and run SETI@home on computers at their workplaces&nbsp;\u2013 an act known as\n\"Borging\", after the assimilation-driven [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]''.

As in any project of prolonged duration, various factors may result in its termination. Some of these are detailed below:\n\n===Potential closure of Arecibo Observatory===\n\nAt present, SETI@home procures its data from the [[Arecibo Observatory]] facility operated by the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and administered by [[SRI International]].\n\nThe decreasing operating budget for the observatory has created a shortfall of funds which has not been made up from other sources such as private donors, [[NASA]], other foreign research institutions, nor private non-profit organizations such as SETI@home.\n\nHowever, in the overall longterm views held by many involved with the SETI project, any usable radio telescope could take over from Arecibo, as all the SETI systems are portable and relocatable.\n\n===Alternative distributed computing projects===\nWhen the project launched,<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/aliens-on-your-packard-bell/527445/</ref> there were few alternative ways of donating computer time to research projects. However, there are now [[List of distributed computing projects|many other projects]] that are competing for such time.{{quantify|date=May 2015}}\n\n===More restrictive computer use policies in businesses===\nIn one documented case, an individual was fired for explicitly importing and using the SETI@home software on computers used for the U.S. state of Ohio.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 9, 2004 |author=John Adams |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/databases/blog/2004/10/knock_down_then_kick.html |title=Knock Down, Then Kick \u2013 O'Reilly Databases |publisher=Oreillynet.com |accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> In another incident a school IT director resigned after his installation allegedly cost his school district $1&nbsp;million in removal costs; however, other reasons for this firing included lack of communication with his superiors, not installing [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] software and alleged theft of computer equipment,<ref>{{cite news |title=Higley firing tied to alien-search software |date=November 30, 2009 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/11/30/20091130searchforaliens1202.html}}</ref> leading a [[ZDNet]] editor to comment that \"the distributed computing nonsense was simply the best and most obvious excuse the district had to terminate his contract [[Dismissal (employment)#Reasons|with cause]]\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Christopher Dawson |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/admin-fired-for-incompetence-not-alien-search/3408 |title=Admin fired for incompetence, not alien search |work=ZDNet |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2005|10|16}}, approximately one-third of the processing for the non-BOINC version of the software was performed on work or school based machines.<ref>{{cite web | author = SETI@home |year = 2005 | url = http://seticlassic.ssl.berkeley.edu/stats/venues.html | title = SETI@home computer venues | accessdate = 12 June 2006}}</ref> As many of these computers will give reduced privileges to ordinary users, it is possible that much of this has been done by [[network administrator]]s.\n\nTo some extent, this may be offset by [[Internet access#History|better connectivity to home machines]] and [[Moore's law|increasing performance]] of home computers,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} especially those with [[GPU]]s,<ref name=\"SETI_GPU\">{{Cite web\n |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=73935\n |title=SETI@home now supports Intel GPUs\n |date=January 29, 2014\n |accessdate=February 19, 2015\n}}</ref> which have also benefited other distributed computing projects such as [[Folding@Home]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.engadget.com/2006/09/29/stanford-university-tailors-folding-home-to-gpus/\n | title = Stanford University tailors Folding@home to GPUs\n | author = Darren Murph\n | accessdate = February 19, 2015\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mhouston/\n | title = Folding@Home \u2013 GPGPU\n | author = Mike Houston\n | accessdate = February 19, 2015\n}}</ref> The spread of [[mobile computing]] devices provides another large resource for distributed computing. For example, in 2012, Piotr Luszczek (a former doctoral student of [[Jack Dongarra]]), presented results showing that an [[iPad 2]] matched the historical performance of a [[Cray-2]] (the fastest computer in the world in 1985) on an embedded [[LINPACK]] benchmark.<ref name=\"iPad2_Cray2\">{{Cite web\n |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE4NjU\n |title=Apple iPad 2 As Fast As The Cray-2 Super Computer\n |first=Michael\n |last=Larabel\n |date=September 16, 2012\n |accessdate=February 19, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n===Funding===\nThere is currently no government [[funding]] for SETI research, and private funding is always limited. Berkeley Space Science Lab has found ways of working with small budgets, and the project has received donations allowing it to go well beyond its original planned duration, but it still has to compete for limited funds with other SETI projects and other space sciences projects.\n\nIn a December 16, 2007 plea for donations, SETI@home stated its present modest state and urged donations of $476,000 needed for continuation into 2008.\n\n===Unofficial clients===\nA number of individuals and companies made unofficial changes to the distributed part of the software to try to produce faster results, but this compromised the integrity of all the results.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The SETI@Home Problem | journal = Crossroads |year = 2000 | first = David | last = Molnar | volume = 7 | issue = 1| url = http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120715134754/http://oldwww.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-1/september2000.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 15 July 2012 | access-date = 30 January 2011}}</ref> As a result, the software had to be updated to make it easier to detect such changes, and discover unreliable clients. BOINC will run on unofficial clients; however, clients that return different and therefore incorrect data are not allowed, so corrupting the result database is avoided. BOINC relies on cross-checking to validate data<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SecurityIssues |title=SecurityIssues \u2013 BOINC \u2013 Trac |publisher=Boinc.berkeley.edu |accessdate=17 May 2009}}</ref> but unreliable clients need to be identified, to avoid situations when two of these report the same invalid data and therefore corrupt the database. A very popular unofficial client (lunatic) allows users to take advantage of the special features provided by their processor(s) such as [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], [[SSE3]], [[SSSE3]], [[SSE4]].1, and [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]] to allow for faster processing.\n\n===Hardware and database failures===\nSETI@home is a test bed for further development not only of BOINC but of other hardware and software (database) technology. Under SETI@home processing loads, these experimental technologies can be more challenging than expected, as SETI databases do not have typical accounting and business data or relational structures. The non-traditional database uses often do incur greater processing overheads and risk of database corruption and outright database failure. Hardware, software and database failures can (and do) cause dips in project participation.\n\nThe project has had to shut down several times to change over to new databases capable of handling more massive datasets. Hardware failure has proven to be a substantial source of project shutdowns, as hardware failure is often coupled with database corruption.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[BrookGPU]]\n*[[Folding@home]]\n*[[Grid computing]]\n*[[List of distributed computing projects]]\n*[[PlanetQuest]]\n*[[Primegrid]]\n*[[Rosetta@home]]\n*[[SETIcon]]\n*[[Systemic (amateur extrasolar planet search project)]]\n*[[World Community Grid]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | title = The Ultimate Hacker: SETI Signals May Need to Be Decontaminated | first = Richard A.

The group forms the [[pre-salt layer]] in the petroleum-rich basin and hosts the biggest oil fields of Brazil, as [[Lula oil field|Lula]], [[Jupiter field|J\u00fapiter]] and [[Santos Basin#Oil and gas fields of the Santos Basin|many more]]. The group contains, depending on the definition, three to four formations and dates to the [[Early Cretaceous]] period; [[Hauterivian]] to [[Aptian|Early Aptian]] epochs. The total thickness of the group, representing the first phase of sedimentation after the break-up of [[Gondwana]] in the Santos Basin, is estimated at {{convert|4200|m|ft}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe formation is named after [[Guaratiba]], a neighbourhood in the west of [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe Guaratiba Group is {{convert|4200|m|ft}} thick and subdivided into three formations, four if the underlying [[basalt]]s of the [[Cambori\u00fa Formation]] are included,<ref name=Clemente2013_p20>Clemente, 2013, p.20</ref> and five if the salt layer of the [[Ariri Formation]] is included,<ref name=Contreras2011_p22>Contreras, 2011, p.22</ref> from old to young the Pi\u00e7arras, Itapema, and Barra Velha Formations.\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n[[File:Half-graben sedimentation.png|thumb|right|330px|The Guaratiba Group of the Santos Basin was deposited in [[half-graben]]s of the opening South Atlantic]]\n[[File:Tupi.jpg|thumb|right|330px|The Tupi prospect, later renamed to Lula Field, honouring the then [[list of presidents of Brazil|president of Brazil]] [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva|Lula]], was the first giant field of many found in the pre-salt Guaratiba Group]]\n;Pi\u00e7arras Formation\nThe Pi\u00e7arras Formation is {{convert|990|m|ft}} thick and consists of clastic and [[carbonate]] rocks. The formation includes reddish polymictic [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], with clasts of basalt and [[quartz]] in a clay-sandy matrix. It also includes white, reddish [[lacustrine]] [[coquina]]s (shelly limestones) and [[sandstone]]s, [[siltstone]]s and [[shale]]s of [[stevensite]] composition. Its age, based on the [[ostracod]] assemblages, is Hauterivian to Aptian.<ref name=Clemente2013_p20/>\n\nThe conglomerates and sandstones of the formation are representative of an [[alluvial]] environment. The coquinas represent a shallow [[lacustrine]] [[depositional environment|environment]]. Similar to the [[Atafona Formation]] of the [[Campos Basin]], the sandstones, stevensite-bearing siltstones and shales represent an alkaline lacustrine environment affected by volcanic activity. The shales represent deeper lacustrine waters in more distal areas. The alternation of the two [[facies]] implies a series of alluvial progradation-retractions into the Early Cretaceous carbonate lakes. The low textural and compositional maturity of conglomerates and sandstones implies the basin was supplied from areas close to the basin margins.<ref name=Clemente2013_p21>Clemente, 2013, p.21</ref>\n\n;Itapema Formation\nThe Itapema Formation is several hundreds of metres thick and consists of calcirudites ([[limestone]]s) and dark shales. The calcirudite limestones consist of fragmented bivalve shells, frequently [[dolomitization|dolomitized]] and silicified. In more distal sections, the formation consists of dark organic matter rich shales. In the well 1-RSJ-625, the formation includes {{convert|110|m|ft}} of radioactive shales interbedded with carbonates. These facies are thought to represent a lacustrine environment. The organic matter-rich shales are one of the main source rocks of the Santos Basin. This formation is correlative with the [[Coqueiros Formation]] in the Campos Basin. The age of the Itapema Formation is [[Barremian]] to Aptian.<ref name=Clemente2013_p21/>\n\n;Barra Velha Formation\nThe Barra Velha Formation is approximately {{convert|300|to|350|m|ft}} thick. In the proximal sections, the formation comprises limestones of [[stromatolite]]s and laminated [[microbialites]]. In the distal sections, it is composed of shales. Interbedded with the laminated microbialites there are limestones with [[packstone]] and [[grainstone]] textures made up of [[algae|algal]] clasts and bioclasts (fragmented ostracods). The carbonates frequently are partly or completely dolomitized. These facies represent a transitional continental and [[shallow marine]] environment. The age of this formation has been estimated to be Late Barremian to Aptian. It is correlative with the [[Macabu Formation]] in the Campos Basin, as both are typified by laminated microbialites and stromatolites. These limestones are one of the sub-salt reservoirs in the Santos Basin, most notably of the giant [[Lula oil field|Lula]] and initially reported as supergiant [[Lapa oil field|Lapa Fields]].<ref name=Clemente2013_p21/><ref name=Ribeiro2017_p136>Ribeiro da Silva & Pereira, 2017, p.136</ref>\n\n=== Petroleum geology ===\nThe formation hosts the important pre-salt [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir rocks]] of the Santos Basin.<ref name=KaroonList>{{cite web|url=http://www.karoon.com.br/en/index.php/proyecto-brasil/?img=6&id=38|website=karoon.com.br|title=Karoon \u2013 Santos Basin Fields|accessdate=2017-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907123836/http://www.karoon.com.br/en/index.php/proyecto-brasil/?img=6&id=38|archive-date=2017-09-07|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Vieira2007_p9>Vieira, 2007, p.9</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!

The total thickness of the group, representing the first phase of sedimentation after the break-up of [[Gondwana]] in the Santos Basin, is estimated at {{convert|4200|m|ft}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe formation is named after [[Guaratiba]], a neighbourhood in the west of [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe Guaratiba Group is {{convert|4200|m|ft}} thick and subdivided into three formations, four if the underlying [[basalt]]s of the [[Cambori\u00fa Formation]] are included,<ref name=Clemente2013_p20>Clemente, 2013, p.20</ref> and five if the salt layer of the [[Ariri Formation]] is included,<ref name=Contreras2011_p22>Contreras, 2011, p.22</ref> from old to young the Pi\u00e7arras, Itapema, and Barra Velha Formations.\n\n=== Subdivision ===\n[[File:Half-graben sedimentation.png|thumb|right|330px|The Guaratiba Group of the Santos Basin was deposited in [[half-graben]]s of the opening South Atlantic]]\n[[File:Tupi.jpg|thumb|right|330px|The Tupi prospect, later renamed to Lula Field, honouring the then [[list of presidents of Brazil|president of Brazil]] [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva|Lula]], was the first giant field of many found in the pre-salt Guaratiba Group]]\n;Pi\u00e7arras Formation\nThe Pi\u00e7arras Formation is {{convert|990|m|ft}} thick and consists of clastic and [[carbonate]] rocks. The formation includes reddish polymictic [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], with clasts of basalt and [[quartz]] in a clay-sandy matrix. It also includes white, reddish [[lacustrine]] [[coquina]]s (shelly limestones) and [[sandstone]]s, [[siltstone]]s and [[shale]]s of [[stevensite]] composition. Its age, based on the [[ostracod]] assemblages, is Hauterivian to Aptian.<ref name=Clemente2013_p20/>\n\nThe conglomerates and sandstones of the formation are representative of an [[alluvial]] environment. The coquinas represent a shallow [[lacustrine]] [[depositional environment|environment]]. Similar to the [[Atafona Formation]] of the [[Campos Basin]], the sandstones, stevensite-bearing siltstones and shales represent an alkaline lacustrine environment affected by volcanic activity. The shales represent deeper lacustrine waters in more distal areas. The alternation of the two [[facies]] implies a series of alluvial progradation-retractions into the Early Cretaceous carbonate lakes. The low textural and compositional maturity of conglomerates and sandstones implies the basin was supplied from areas close to the basin margins.<ref name=Clemente2013_p21>Clemente, 2013, p.21</ref>\n\n;Itapema Formation\nThe Itapema Formation is several hundreds of metres thick and consists of calcirudites ([[limestone]]s) and dark shales. The calcirudite limestones consist of fragmented bivalve shells, frequently [[dolomitization|dolomitized]] and silicified. In more distal sections, the formation consists of dark organic matter rich shales. In the well 1-RSJ-625, the formation includes {{convert|110|m|ft}} of radioactive shales interbedded with carbonates. These facies are thought to represent a lacustrine environment. The organic matter-rich shales are one of the main source rocks of the Santos Basin. This formation is correlative with the [[Coqueiros Formation]] in the Campos Basin. The age of the Itapema Formation is [[Barremian]] to Aptian.<ref name=Clemente2013_p21/>\n\n;Barra Velha Formation\nThe Barra Velha Formation is approximately {{convert|300|to|350|m|ft}} thick. In the proximal sections, the formation comprises limestones of [[stromatolite]]s and laminated [[microbialites]]. In the distal sections, it is composed of shales. Interbedded with the laminated microbialites there are limestones with [[packstone]] and [[grainstone]] textures made up of [[algae|algal]] clasts and bioclasts (fragmented ostracods). The carbonates frequently are partly or completely dolomitized. These facies represent a transitional continental and [[shallow marine]] environment. The age of this formation has been estimated to be Late Barremian to Aptian. It is correlative with the [[Macabu Formation]] in the Campos Basin, as both are typified by laminated microbialites and stromatolites. These limestones are one of the sub-salt reservoirs in the Santos Basin, most notably of the giant [[Lula oil field|Lula]] and initially reported as supergiant [[Lapa oil field|Lapa Fields]].<ref name=Clemente2013_p21/><ref name=Ribeiro2017_p136>Ribeiro da Silva & Pereira, 2017, p.136</ref>\n\n=== Petroleum geology ===\nThe formation hosts the important pre-salt [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir rocks]] of the Santos Basin.<ref name=KaroonList>{{cite web|url=http://www.karoon.com.br/en/index.php/proyecto-brasil/?img=6&id=38|website=karoon.com.br|title=Karoon \u2013 Santos Basin Fields|accessdate=2017-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907123836/http://www.karoon.com.br/en/index.php/proyecto-brasil/?img=6&id=38|archive-date=2017-09-07|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Vieira2007_p9>Vieira, 2007, p.9</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!
