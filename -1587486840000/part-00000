Bradley, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[What If (comics)|of the same name]]. It explores what would happen if major moments from [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of]] the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) occurred differently. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], their first animated series since becoming their own production company. Bradley serves as [[head writer]] of the series, with [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]] directing.\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] stars as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of series for Disney+, and one based on the ''What If...?'' comic was first reported in March 2019. The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, which was designed to reflect the films. Half of the first season's animation is provided by Squeeze, with [[Stephan Franck]] serving as head of animation on the series.\n\n''What If...?''{{'}}s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. A second 10-episode season has been announced.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series explores what would happen if major moments from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] occurred differently.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Uatu|Uatu / The Watcher]]:<br />A member of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher race]], who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \"above everything else\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the [[Rats in New York City#Notable incidents|\"pizza rat\" video]], stating that he is \"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\"/>\n\n=== Guest ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter|Captain Peggy Carter]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /><ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> / [[Star-Lord]]<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Samuel L.

The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wielded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n===Writing===\nFeige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features [[Peggy Carter]] taking the super soldier serum instead of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> A.C. Bradley serves as head writer of the series,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> with Matthew Chauncey serving as story editor.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Episodes were conceived and written by Bradley, Chauncey, series director [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]], executive producer Brad Winderbaum, junior executive Simona Paparelli, and script coordinator Ryan Little, with the ''What If...?'' comics providing inspiration for potential story points. After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2021) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included [[Michael B. Jordan]] as [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Loki, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]], [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Hayley Atwell]] as Peggy Carter, [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]], [[Neal McDonough]] as [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]], [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin, [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], [[Taika Waititi]] as [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], [[Toby Jones]] as [[Arnim Zola]], [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath]], [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], and [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu]]. Feige also announced that [[Jeffrey Wright]] had been cast as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> A month later, Atwell revealed that voice recording for the series had already begun.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /> Goldblum indicated in November 2019 that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would be reprising his role as [[Iron Man (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in the series.<ref name=\"Downey\" />\n\n===Animation===\nThe series, directed by Andrews,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> will feature a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, with character likenesses based on the actors from the films.<ref name=\"EWD23\" /> Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios, worked with Andrews to find the animation style for the series, which Bradley described as more of a \"cinematic style\". Bradley added that Marvel was \"trying to use the color palette, the lighting, [and] the character design to tell as much story as you can\" similarly as in live-action film.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Animation studio Squeeze will work on five of ten episodes in the series' first season.<ref name=\"Squeeze\" /> [[Stephan Franck]] serves as head of animation on the series.<ref name=\"FranckNewsarama\" />\n\nProduction was able to continue remotely during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with on-site work at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] lot suspended.<ref name=\"FranckNewsarama\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nFootage from the series' first episode was shown during the [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] 2019,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\"/> with footage from the series also included in ''Expanding the Universe'', a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.<ref name=\"ExpandingTheUniverseFootage\" />\n\n==Release==\n''What If...?'' is expected to debut in mid-2021,<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> and will consist of 10 episodes.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" /> Episodes will be released weekly rather than all at once.<ref name=\"EpisodeRelease\" /> It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseFour\" /> A second season has been announced.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/loki-scarlet-witch-tv-series-marvel-disney-streaming-service-1202947551/ |title=Loki, Scarlet Witch, Other Marvel Heroes to Get Own TV Series on Disney Streaming Service (Exclusive) |last=Kroll |first=Justin |date=September 18, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/72XWaEZfB?url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/loki-scarlet-witch-tv-series-marvel-disney-streaming-service-1202947551/ |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/falcon-winter-soldier-tv-series-disney-streaming-service-marvel-1202492782/ |title=Marvel Duo Falcon & Winter Soldier Teaming For Disney Streaming Series |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |last2=Hipes |first2=Patrick |date=October 30, 2018 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/73ZWes7yO?url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/falcon-winter-soldier-tv-series-disney-streaming-service-marvel-1202492782/# |archive-date=October 31, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=October 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/what-if-tv-series-coming-to-disney-plus/ |title=Exclusive: Marvel Studios Producing 'What If' TV Series For Disney+ |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |date=March 12, 2019 |website=[[/Film]] |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/7719lgKiY |archive-date=March 20, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/all-marvel-disney-plus-news-coming-out-of-investor-day |title=All of the Marvel Disney+ News Coming Out of The Walt Disney Company's Investor Day |last=Dinh |first=Christine |date=April 12, 2019 |website=[[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412080938/http://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/all-marvel-disney-plus-news-coming-out-of-investor-day |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SDCCCast\">{{Cite web |url=http://collider.com/marvels-what-if-announces-massive-voice-cast-of-mcu-stars-jeffrey-wright-as-the-watcher/ |title=Marvel's 'What If?'

Bradley, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[What If (comics)|of the same name]]. It explores what would happen if major moments from [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of]] the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) occurred differently. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], their first animated series since becoming their own production company. Bradley serves as [[head writer]] of the series, with [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]] directing.\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] stars as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of series for Disney+, and one based on the ''What If...?'' comic was first reported in March 2019. The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, which was designed to reflect the films. Half of the first season's animation is provided by Squeeze, with [[Stephan Franck]] serving as head of animation on the series.\n\n''What If...?''{{'}}s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. A second 10-episode season has been announced.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series explores what would happen if major moments from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] occurred differently.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Uatu|Uatu / The Watcher]]:<br />A member of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher race]], who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \"above everything else\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the [[Rats in New York City#Notable incidents|\"pizza rat\" video]], stating that he is \"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\"/>\n\n=== Guest ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter|Captain Peggy Carter]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /><ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> / [[Star-Lord]]<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Samuel L.

The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wielded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n===Writing===\nFeige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features [[Peggy Carter]] taking the super soldier serum instead of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> A.C. Bradley serves as head writer of the series,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> with Matthew Chauncey serving as story editor.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Episodes were conceived and written by Bradley, Chauncey, series director [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]], executive producer Brad Winderbaum, junior executive Simona Paparelli, and script coordinator Ryan Little, with the ''What If...?'' comics providing inspiration for potential story points. After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2021) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included [[Michael B. Jordan]] as [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Loki, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]], [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Hayley Atwell]] as Peggy Carter, [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]], [[Neal McDonough]] as [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]], [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin, [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], [[Taika Waititi]] as [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], [[Toby Jones]] as [[Arnim Zola]], [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath]], [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], and [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu]]. Feige also announced that [[Jeffrey Wright]] had been cast as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> A month later, Atwell revealed that voice recording for the series had already begun.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /> Goldblum indicated in November 2019 that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would be reprising his role as [[Iron Man (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in the series.<ref name=\"Downey\" />\n\n===Animation===\nThe series, directed by Andrews,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> will feature a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, with character likenesses based on the actors from the films.<ref name=\"EWD23\" /> Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios, worked with Andrews to find the animation style for the series, which Bradley described as more of a \"cinematic style\".

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Waldron serving as [[head writer]] and Kate Herron directing.\n\n[[Tom Hiddleston]] reprises his role as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] from the film series. [[Sophia Di Martino]], [[Owen Wilson]], and [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] also star. With Marvel Studios developing a number of limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, the series was officially confirmed in November 2018, along with Hiddleston's involvement. Waldron was hired in February 2019, and Herron had joined by that August. Filming of the series began in January 2020.\n\n''Loki'' is expected to be released in early 2021, and will consist of six episodes.

The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios, rather than [[Marvel Television]] who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] confirmed in November that a series centered on Loki was in development and that [[Tom Hiddleston]] was expected to reprise his role from the film series.<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" />\n\nMichael Waldron was hired as [[head writer]] and executive producer of the series in February 2019. He was also set to write the pilot episode. The series was expected to follow Loki as he \"pops up throughout human history as an unlikely influencer on historical events\".<ref name=\"Waldron\" /> A month later, Feige stated that Loki is over a thousand years old in the MCU films, so the series would be exploring what he has done throughout his long life. He added that the interest for Marvel Studios in making the series was to work with Hiddleston more and explore the character of Loki beyond him being a supporting character in the films.<ref name=\"FeigeConnectedMar2019\" /> Hiddleston explained in August 2019 that he had known about his cameo role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) when he filmed Loki's death for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), but he considered the latter to be the emotional end of his character arc. He then learned about the plans for a Loki series around six weeks before ''Infinity War'' was released, and kept the series a secret until its official announcement later that year. He expressed excitement about being able to change Loki in different ways by taking an earlier version of the character and \"seeing him come up against more formidable opponents, the like of which he has never seen\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMTVAug2019Yahoo\" /> Also that month, Kate Herron was revealed to be directing and executive producing the miniseries, which was confirmed to run for six episodes.<ref name=\"Herron\" /><ref name=\"EpisodesRuntime\" /><ref name=\"Durald\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Tom Hiddleston (48468962561) cropped.jpg|thumb|Hiddleston promoting the series at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nThe series takes place after ''Avengers: Endgame'', which saw Loki steal the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] during the 2012 events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012),<ref name=\"DigitalSpySDCC\" /> which created an alternate timeline from the main MCU films.<ref name=\"AltTimeline\" /> In the series, Loki uses the Tesseract to travel through time and alter human history.<ref name=\"Logline\" /> In August 2019, Herron stated that the series would be \"taking Loki to an entirely new part of the MCU\" while Waldron said it would \"explore the questions we all have: where did Loki go after he picked up the Tesseract? Could Loki ever make a friend? And will the sun ever shine on him again?\"<ref name=\"Herron\" /> Executive producer Stephen Broussard stated that in addition to the time travel element, the series would have a \"man-on-the-run quality to it\".<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> Waldron also felt the series would explore the character's \"struggle with identity\", adding \"over the first 10 years of movies, he's out of control at pivotal parts of his life, he was adopted and everything and that manifest itself through anger and spite towards his family.\"<ref name=\"WaldronMar2020\" /> According to Feige, the series will tie-into the 2021 film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.<ref name=\"Strange\" />\n\n===Casting===\nWith the November 2018 announcement of the series, Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role as Loki,<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" /> with his involvement confirmed in February 2019 by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Alan F.

(comics)|of the same name]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Waldron serving as [[head writer]] and Kate Herron directing.\n\n[[Tom Hiddleston]] reprises his role as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] from the film series. [[Sophia Di Martino]], [[Owen Wilson]], and [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] also star. With Marvel Studios developing a number of limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, the series was officially confirmed in November 2018, along with Hiddleston's involvement. Waldron was hired in February 2019, and Herron had joined by that August. Filming of the series began in January 2020.\n\n''Loki'' is expected to be released in early 2021, and will consist of six episodes. It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Loki uses the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] to travel through time and alter human history.<ref name=\"Logline\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]:<br />[[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]'s adoptive brother and god of mischief based on the Norse mythological deity of the [[Loki|same name]].<ref name=\"HiddlestonConfirmed\" /> This version of Loki created a new timeline in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) beginning in 2012, so he has not gone through the events of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) or ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017) which \"reformed\" the previously villainous character.<ref name=\"Logline\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Sophia Di Martino]],<ref name=\"Martino\" /> [[Owen Wilson]],<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> and [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"Mbatha-Raw\" />\n\n===Guest===\n* [[Richard E.

The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios, rather than [[Marvel Television]] who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] confirmed in November that a series centered on Loki was in development and that [[Tom Hiddleston]] was expected to reprise his role from the film series.<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" />\n\nMichael Waldron was hired as [[head writer]] and executive producer of the series in February 2019. He was also set to write the pilot episode. The series was expected to follow Loki as he \"pops up throughout human history as an unlikely influencer on historical events\".<ref name=\"Waldron\" /> A month later, Feige stated that Loki is over a thousand years old in the MCU films, so the series would be exploring what he has done throughout his long life. He added that the interest for Marvel Studios in making the series was to work with Hiddleston more and explore the character of Loki beyond him being a supporting character in the films.<ref name=\"FeigeConnectedMar2019\" /> Hiddleston explained in August 2019 that he had known about his cameo role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) when he filmed Loki's death for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), but he considered the latter to be the emotional end of his character arc. He then learned about the plans for a Loki series around six weeks before ''Infinity War'' was released, and kept the series a secret until its official announcement later that year. He expressed excitement about being able to change Loki in different ways by taking an earlier version of the character and \"seeing him come up against more formidable opponents, the like of which he has never seen\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMTVAug2019Yahoo\" /> Also that month, Kate Herron was revealed to be directing and executive producing the miniseries, which was confirmed to run for six episodes.<ref name=\"Herron\" /><ref name=\"EpisodesRuntime\" /><ref name=\"Durald\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Tom Hiddleston (48468962561) cropped.jpg|thumb|Hiddleston promoting the series at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nThe series takes place after ''Avengers: Endgame'', which saw Loki steal the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] during the 2012 events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012),<ref name=\"DigitalSpySDCC\" /> which created an alternate timeline from the main MCU films.<ref name=\"AltTimeline\" /> In the series, Loki uses the Tesseract to travel through time and alter human history.<ref name=\"Logline\" /> In August 2019, Herron stated that the series would be \"taking Loki to an entirely new part of the MCU\" while Waldron said it would \"explore the questions we all have: where did Loki go after he picked up the Tesseract? Could Loki ever make a friend? And will the sun ever shine on him again?\"<ref name=\"Herron\" /> Executive producer Stephen Broussard stated that in addition to the time travel element, the series would have a \"man-on-the-run quality to it\".<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> Waldron also felt the series would explore the character's \"struggle with identity\", adding \"over the first 10 years of movies, he's out of control at pivotal parts of his life, he was adopted and everything and that manifest itself through anger and spite towards his family.\"<ref name=\"WaldronMar2020\" /> According to Feige, the series will tie-into the 2021 film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.<ref name=\"Strange\" />\n\n===Casting===\nWith the November 2018 announcement of the series, Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role as Loki,<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" /> with his involvement confirmed in February 2019 by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Alan F. Horn]].<ref name=\"HiddlestonConfirmed\" /> In November 2019, [[Sophia Di Martino]] was cast in a \"highly contested\" unspecified role,<ref name=\"Martino\" /> reported to be a female incarnation of Loki.<ref name=\"Martino2\" /> In January 2020, [[Owen Wilson]] joined the cast as \"a prominent character\",<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> followed the next month with the casting of [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as the female lead, also said to be \"a prominent character\".<ref name=\"Mbatha-Raw\"/>\n\nIn March 2020, [[Richard E. Grant]] was cast in an undisclosed role for a single episode of the series.<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in January 2020,<ref name=\"FilmingEW\" /><ref name=\"Wilson\" /> under the [[working title]] ''River Cruise'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> with Herron directing.<ref name=\"Herron\" /> [[Autumn Durald]] serves as cinematographer for the series.<ref name=\"Durald\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] throughout the month of February.<ref name=\"Atlanta\" /> On March 14, production on the series was halted due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Coronavirus\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nA commercial for the series, ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[WandaVision]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref name=\"VergeSuperBowlSpot\" /> Haleigh Foutch at ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \"stole the whole show\" and had \"a lot to get excited about\".<ref

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of Roy Kapur Films, [[RSVP Movies]], and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], respectively, in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]], who suffered from [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, as they navigate their marriage while dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while the Hindi dialogue were written by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of Roy Kapur Films, [[RSVP Movies]], and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], respectively, in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]], who suffered from [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, as they navigate their marriage while dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while the Hindi dialogue were written by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.

Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> By the end of October, [[Paul Bettany]]'s [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was expected to play a significant role in the series, which would focus on the relationship between Scarlet Witch and Vision.<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> In the following months, the titles ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' and ''The Vision and Scarlet Witch'' were both reported.<ref name=\"DeadlineTitle\" /><ref name=\"Schaeffer\" /><ref name=\"SchaefferDeadline\" />\n\n[[Jac Schaeffer]] was hired as [[head writer]] of the series in January 2019 after previously working as a writer on the films ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019) and ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020) for Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"Schaeffer\" /><ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> Schaeffer was set to write the pilot episode and executive produce the series.<ref name=\"Schaeffer\" /> That April, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series with the title ''WandaVision''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> Later in the month, Olsen indicated parts of the series would be set in the 1950s.<ref name=\"OlsenApril2019\" /> In August, [[Matt Shakman]] was hired to direct the miniseries, which consists of six episodes.<ref name=\"Shakman\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25 million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" /> At Disney's biennial convention [[D23 Expo|D23]], Feige described the series as part \"classic [[sitcom]]\", part \"Marvel epic\", and showed a teaser for the series that combined footage from previous MCU films featuring Maximoff and Vision with images from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' and ''[[Father Knows Best]]''.<ref name=\"D232019\" /><ref name=\"YahooRoundUp\" /> Bettany called the series \"super avant-garde and weird\", while Olsen added that there were \"plenty of comic books that support\" the characters appearing in a sitcom setting.<ref name=\"IGND232019\" /> Olsen also indicated that there were ongoing discussions regarding whether the series would use a [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"YahooRoundUp\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series takes place after ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'',<ref name=\"Parris\" /> and its events tie-into the 2021 MCU film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', which includes Maximoff.<ref name=\"DoctorStrange2\" /> Schaeffer hired eight writers for the series' writers room, including four women and several people of color because of her belief that \"stories are better the more perspectives you have\".<ref name=\"SchaefferInverseJul2019\" /> Megan McDonnell served as a staff writer on the series, before being promoted to story editor.<ref name=\"McDonnell\" /> Comparing her work on the series to the film ''Black Widow'', Schaeffer said ''WandaVision'' would be \"the polar opposite\" to the film's style of aggressive, visceral action.<ref name=\"SchaefferInverseJul2019\" /> Comic book writer [[Tom King (writer)|Tom King]] indicated in October 2019 that his run on ''The Vision'' would be an inspiration for ''WandaVision''.<ref name=\"KingInfluence\" /> In December 2019, Feige described the series as an opportunity to tell the story of Maximoff and Vision, show more of what Wanda can do, further explore who Vision is, and introduce the comic book name \"Scarlet Witch\" to the MCU \"in ways that are entirely fun, entirely funny, somewhat scary, and will have repercussions for the entire future of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase 4]] of the MCU\".<ref name=\"CCXP2019Feige\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Elizabeth Olsen & Paul Bettany (48469160767).jpg|thumb|Olsen and Bettany at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Olsen and Bettany would reprise their roles of Maximoff and Vision, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> [[Teyonah Parris]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Monica Rambeau]] in July 2019;

Foutch said the ''WandaVision'' footage was \"the most exciting\", saying it was \"utterly strange and unpredictable looking\".<ref name=\"ColliderSuperBowlSpot\" />\n\n==Release==\n''WandaVision'' is

The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each, have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\", and be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]].

There were also concerns over soldiers seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had joined the army in the hope of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} The Legion came as a solution for those who would not conform to the governing agenda: a way for the French State to contend the most restless soldiers and keep them at sight.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the soldiers during the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}. The Algerian war was very unpopular. [[Louis Philipe I]] was a pacifist and did not want to risk to loose the favours of the public opinion, nor did he want to upset his military commandment by endangering too many French lives. Hence the idea of using foreign troops, that would be recruited for the combats and that would be organised in a dedicated corps: the French Foreign Legion. \n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

A [[Germanic Legion]], an {{ill|Italian Legion|fr|L\u00e9gion Italique}}, a [[Batavian Legion]], and a [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legion]] were also formed.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=12}}.

There were also concerns over soldiers seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had joined the army in the hope of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} The Legion came as a solution for those who would not conform to the governing agenda: a way for the French State to contend the most restless soldiers and keep them at sight.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the soldiers during the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}. The Algerian war was very unpopular. [[Louis Philipe I]] was a pacifist and did not want to risk to loose the favours of the public opinion, nor did he want to upset his military commandment by endangering too many French lives. Hence the idea of using foreign troops, that would be recruited for the combats and that would be organised in a dedicated corps: the French Foreign Legion. \n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

Each successive [[Pok\u00e9mon#Generations|generation]] of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pok\u00e9mon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|anime]] long before appearing in the games, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Pok\u00e9mon Abilities]] are similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Powers introduced in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', which also introduced [[#Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|Shiny Pok\u00e9mon]], different colors of that type of the original Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon with very high stats and good moves are used in [[Pok\u00e9mon competitive play]], which requires more complex strategies than picking supereffective moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/strategy/making-the-jump-to-video-game-competitive-play/|title=Making the Jump to Video Game Competitive Play - Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Game structure ==\nEach game in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series takes place in a fictional region of the Pok\u00e9mon world and begins with the player receiving a [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] from that region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor. By traveling around the world, [[#Catching Pok\u00e9mon|catching]] and [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolving]] Pok\u00e9mon, and defeating other Trainers in [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battle]], the player increases the size and strength of their Pok\u00e9mon collection. A major subplot of each game is to defeat a [[criminal organization]], whose intents are usually trying to take over the world through the misuse of Pok\u00e9mon. These organizations include [[Team Rocket]], Neo Team Rocket, [[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]], [[Team Galactic]], [[Team Plasma]], Neo Team Plasma, [[Team Flare]], [[Team Skull]], [[Team Rainbow Rocket]], the [[Aether Foundation]], [[Team Yell]], and [[Macro Cosmos]].\n\nVarious facilities can be found throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world such as Pok\u00e9mon Centers, Pok\u00e9 Marts, and Gyms. At a Pok\u00e9mon Center, the player can have their Pok\u00e9mon healed for free and access the PC, where players can organize their collection of Pok\u00e9mon, store and withdraw items, and have their Pok\u00e9dex rated. Before ''X'' and ''Y'', this is also where players can link up with other game cartridges or cards to battle or [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|trade]] with other players. Pok\u00e9 Marts are shops where players can buy [[#Items|items]] with the money they win during battles; certain cities may have specialized shops, like a pharmacy or a department store. Periodically, a town will contain a [[#Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|Pok\u00e9mon Gym]], which houses a powerful Trainer known as a [[Gym Leader]]. Victory against them grants the player a Gym Badge; after collecting eight Gym Badges, the player may challenge the region's [[Elite Four]] and Champion. Gyms are absent in ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'' , and ''Ultra Moon'', being replaced by trials which serve a similar purpose. Upon completion of a Trial, the player receives a Z-Crystal, which grants a Pok\u00e9mon access to an extremely powerful move called a Z-Move. The trend of Gyms continues in ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\nCompleting the main storyline opens up other features in the games; this is primarily done by allowing passage into otherwise inaccessible places. Afterward, the game remains virtually open-ended, with the ultimate goal of the player being to obtain at least one member of each of the different species of Pok\u00e9mon, thus completing the [[Pok\u00e9dex]]. The number of Pok\u00e9mon increases with each game generation, starting from 151 in the first generation to 890 as of ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Gyms ===\n{{nihongo|Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e0|Pok\u00e9mon Jimu}} are buildings situated throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world, where Pok\u00e9mon Trainers can train or compete to qualify for Pok\u00e9mon League competitions. Although the internal organizations of Pok\u00e9mon Gyms may vary, the majority specialize in one certain type of Pok\u00e9mon, and all are manned by a {{nihongo4|[[Gym Leader]]|\u30b8\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Jimu R\u012bd\u0101}}, a formidable Trainer that acts as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Pok\u00e9mon Gyms can be found in many towns and cities in the Pok\u00e9mon world.\n\nIn each Gym, there are various Gym Trainers that the player may face before battling the Gym Leader. These Gym Trainers are often placed so that the player is forced into battle with them. When a Trainer defeats a Gym Leader in battle, the former wins a {{nihongo4|Badge|\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8|Bajji}}, which serves as proof of a Trainer's skill and is a key part of advancing the plot. In ''Sword'' and ''Shield'', a Trainer must complete a Gym Challenge, which is essentially a minigame, in order to continue through the Gym. Also, this will earn the former a [[Technical and Hidden Machines|Technical Machine]] (prior to ''Sun'' and ''Moon''), which allows the player to teach their Pok\u00e9mon a certain move. It also usually enables the player to utilize the overworld effects of one of the various Hidden Machines, such as the ability to cross bodies of water with the move Surf or the ability to remove some trees from paths with the move Cut. As the player collects Gym Badges, the maximum level at which traded Pok\u00e9mon obey their commands increases. \n\nAfter a player defeats the eight Gym Leaders, they can travel through Victory Road, and then proceed to the Pok\u00e9mon League and challenge the {{nihongo4|[[Elite Four]]|\u56db\u5929\u738b|Shitenn\u014d}} and the region's Pok\u00e9mon League {{nihongo4|Champion|\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3|Champion}}. Defeating the Champion is considered to be the goal of the game.\n\n=== Island Trials ===\nIn ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'', there are no Gyms or Gym Leaders. The player is instead given various \"trials\" by characters known as Trial Captains. A trial usually presents the player with a task they must complete to summon a Totem Pok\u00e9mon, a more powerful version of a certain species of Pok\u00e9mon. Once the player has summoned and defeated the Totem Pok\u00e9mon, they receive a Z-Crystal, an item that allows Pok\u00e9mon to use powerful moves known as \"Z-Moves\". Completing all of the trials on an island allows the player to challenge that island's \"kahuna\" in a standard Pok\u00e9mon battle. The player can challenge the Pok\u00e9mon League after they have completed all four Grand Trials. After defeating the Elite Four, the player can defend their title as Champion by defeating a challenger.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon battles ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9mon FireRed first battle.png|left|frame|In a battle scene in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version]]'', the Pok\u00e9mon at the top right of the screen is the opponent's; the bottom left is the player's. The player's options are shown at the bottom right.]]\n\nBattles between Pok\u00e9mon are the central game mechanic of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games. They are used to train Pok\u00e9mon to become stronger, like competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players by connecting two games.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon'' uses a [[turn-based]] system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the screen changes to a battle scene with the player's Pok\u00e9mon, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon, their respective [[Health (gaming)|HP]] bars, and an option menu. At any time, the player may carry up to six Pok\u00e9mon in his or her active party; the first Pok\u00e9mon in the lineup is automatically sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attack]], use an [[#Items|item]], switch the Pok\u00e9mon for another in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pok\u00e9mon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first is determined by [[#Stats|Speed]], although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other option, that action is performed before the attacks.\n\nEach Pok\u00e9mon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|faints|\u3072\u3093\u3057|hinshi}} and is unable to battle. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon wins, it receives [[experience point]]s; when enough have accumulated, the Pok\u00e9mon's level increases. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon faints, he/she may use another Pok\u00e9mon; in battles against wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If all of a player's Pok\u00e9mon faint, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return to the last Pok\u00e9mon Center they visited.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond Version'' instruction booklet. p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] introduced {{nihongo4|Double Battles|\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Daburu Batoru}}, in which the opposing teams battle with two Pok\u00e9mon at a time. Though the basic mechanics remain the same, moves may have multiple targets, and some affect the ally as well as the opponents. Additionally, some [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]] work only in Double Battles. {{nihongo4|Multi Battles|\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Maruchi Batoru}} were also introduced, with four Trainers in teams of two.

This means that an attack which would normally deal double damage instead deals half damage, and vice versa.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'' also introduce a new battle type, the SOS Battle. In these battles, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon may call for allies to assist them, making the battle two-on-one against the player.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon types ===\n[[File:Pokemon Type Chart.svg|thumb|275px|This chart shows the current eighteen Pok\u00e9mon types (as of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'') and their strengths, weaknesses, and immunities against one another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-x-and-pokemon-y/|title=Pok\u00e9mon X and Pok\u00e9mon Y &#124; Video Games & Apps|website=www.pokemon.com}}</ref>]]\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|type|\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7|taipu}} is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pok\u00e9mon and its moves. Pok\u00e9mon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves they resist. These type matchups offset one another in [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]]-style relationships. Some Pok\u00e9mon types grant full immunity to certain attack types; for instance, Ghost types take no damage from Normal or Fighting-type moves. Some Pok\u00e9mon Abilities can change these interactions, such as Levitate making Pok\u00e9mon immune to Ground-type moves.\n\nIn the original ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'' games, there are a total of 15 Pok\u00e9mon types: Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, and Dragon. The Dark and Steel types were added in ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', and the Fairy type was introduced in ''X'' and ''Y''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/why-game-freak-introduced-the-fairy-type-in-pokemon-512779904|title=Why Game Freak Introduced The Fairy Type In Pokemon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.\n\nThe console RPGs ''Colosseum'' and ''XD'' featured a unique move type known as Shadow, but it does not appear outside these games. Shadow Pok\u00e9mon can be considered to be of this type, but they still retain their regular typing as well. In ''Pok\u00e9mon XD'', Shadow moves are super effective against non-Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and not very effective against Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon moves ===\nLike the characters in many [[role-playing video game]]s, Pok\u00e9mon can learn a wide variety of {{nihongo4|moves|\u6280|waza}}. These moves may inflict damage, induce status problems, restore health, or perform actions that in some way affect the battle. The general strength of and resistance to these moves are determined by the various [[#Stats|statistics]] a particular Pok\u00e9mon has. All moves have a type, {{nihongo4|power|\u5a01\u529b|Iryoku}}, accuracy, and a number of Power Points (PP). The moves that one Pok\u00e9mon may learn are different from another depending on the species of Pok\u00e9mon; even those that [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] from others do not necessarily learn all the same moves that their predecessors learn. Each Pok\u00e9mon may only know a total of four moves at any one time. Moves may be learned through leveling up, using [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|TMs and HMs]], [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]], and move tutors ([[Non-player character|NPC]]s that teach moves).\n\nEach move is classified as one of the 18 [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|Pok\u00e9mon types]]. The effectiveness of a move is dependent on how susceptible the target Pok\u00e9mon's type is to the move's type. Phrases associated with this aspect are \"It's super effective!\" (damage is at least doubled), \"It's not very effective\u2026\" (damage is at least halved), and \"It doesn't affect [defending Pok\u00e9mon]...\" (damage and all effects are negated). A Pok\u00e9mon with the same type as the move it uses will receive a 50% bonus to its damage, referred to as a \"Same-Type Attack Bonus\" (STAB). Moves are further defined as \"physical\" or \"special\"; before the ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' games, moves' status of being either physical or special depended on the type, rather than on the individual move. There are also \"status\" moves, which deal no damage and often inflict status changes on the defending or attacking Pok\u00e9mon. Damage-inflicting moves remove a certain number of [[Health (gaming)|Health Points]] from the target Pok\u00e9mon based on the types of the move and its target, and on the statistics of the two Pok\u00e9mon. The damage can also be affected by [[#Items|items]] held by either Pok\u00e9mon or by their [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]].\n\nEach move has a specific {{nihongo4|accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d|Meich\u016b}}, which determines the chance of hitting the target Pok\u00e9mon assuming no changes are made to user's [[#Stats|accuracy]] or the target's evasiveness. Very powerful moves often have below-average accuracy. Moves with standard 100% accuracy ratings are susceptible to changes in accuracy and evasiveness, but some moves bypass both and always land.\n\nThe PP (Power Points) of a move indicate how many times a Pok\u00e9mon may use that move. As with accuracy, a powerful move is often offset by having a low number of PP. Once a Pok\u00e9mon uses up all the PP for a certain move, it can no longer use that move. If a Pok\u00e9mon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to a move called Struggle, which damages the user as well as the target. Depleted PP can be restored by using certain items or by visiting a Pok\u00e9mon Center.\n\nMany moves have effects beyond inflicting damage. A common secondary effect is a chance to induce a certain {{nihongo4|[[status effect]]|\u72b6\u614b\u7570\u5e38|j\u014dtai ij\u014d}} on the target: {{nihongo4|paralysis|\u307e\u3072|Mahi}}, {{nihongo4|burn|\u3084\u3051\u3069|Yakedo}}, {{nihongo4|freeze|\u3053\u304a\u308a|K\u014dri}}, {{nihongo4|poison|\u3069\u304f|Doku}}, or {{nihongo4|sleep|\u306d\u3080\u308a|Nemuri}}; each negatively affects how the afflicted Pok\u00e9mon performs in battle. Some moves have negative side-effects for the user, such as forcing the player to wait a turn before or after use or causing recoil damage. A few moves, such as Splash, does nothing whatsoever except when used as a Z-Move.\n\n=== Z-Moves ===\nOnce per battle, if a Pok\u00e9mon holds a Z-Crystal, a powerful object you get from completing island trials, it can use an upgraded version of one of its moves, called a Z-Move. Z-Moves based on attacking moves tend to have much higher power than normal; those based on status moves usually incur a benefit on the user before executing the move.\n\n=== Moves outside of battles ===\nCertain moves can also be used in the overworld to bypass obstacles, quickly travel between locations, escape dungeons, or heal Pok\u00e9mon. Usually, Pok\u00e9mon will learn these moves with the use of the [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|HM]] items and will be able to use them in the aforementioned ways after certain Badges are obtained.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon abilities ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Abilities|\u7279\u6027|Tokusei}} are special attributes which were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. Specific species of Pok\u00e9mon have one to three possible Abilities, with individual Pok\u00e9mon exhibiting one Ability each. Unlike the moves a Pok\u00e9mon knows, its Ability cannot normally change (except sometimes during evolution, and by using the Ability Capsule, which was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']]).\n\nMost Pok\u00e9mon use their Abilities in battle. Abilities can strengthen a Pok\u00e9mon's statistics or weaken a foe, inflict [[status effect]]s such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform other effects. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as Water Absorb - when a Pokemon with this Ability gets hit by a Water-type attack, it absorbs the attack upon contact, recovering HP in the process, rather than losing HP as normal. Not all Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pok\u00e9mon. For example, [[Slaking (Pok\u00e9mon)|Slaking]], which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only lets it attack every other turn.\n\nSome Abilities have effects outside of Pok\u00e9mon battles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon with the Pickup Ability will sometimes retrieve items off the ground. A Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability Intimidate, mentioned above, will cause the player to encounter lower-level wild Pok\u00e9mon less often.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;277</ref>\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'' introduced Hidden Abilities, which initially could only be found on Pok\u00e9mon acquired from the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link, either through the Pok\u00e9mon Dream World feature or through promotional releases. There are also rare instances of Hidden Abilities available in the main game, either as a special encounter or as a Trade with an NPC. ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' introduced the game mechanic of {{nihongo4|Hidden Grottoes|\u96a0\u3057\u7a74|Kakushi Ana}}, areas where the player has a chance to find a Pok\u00e9mon that has its Hidden Ability. Subsequent games introduced more means of obtaining Pok\u00e9mon with Hidden Abilities; for instance, Pok\u00e9mon encountered in Horde Battles have a small chance of having their Hidden Ability.\n\n== Stats ==\nAll Pok\u00e9mon have six {{nihongo4|[[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]|\u80fd\u529b|N\u014dryoku|\"Attribute\"}} which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-natures-tips-tricks-guide-synchronise-everstone/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Natures: How Personality Changes Stats And Abilities|date=12 April 2019|website=TheGamer|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.\n* '''HP''' (short for Health Points): <!-- the official Pok\u00e9mon Emerald website says it's \"Health Points\" in Tucker's trivia; can we add this as a citation? --> A Pok\u00e9mon faints when its HP reaches zero, and it cannot be used in battle again until it is revived at a Pok\u00e9mon Center, or with a special item. However, they can still use moves in the field.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Attack'''|\u3053\u3046\u3052\u304d|K\u014dgeki}}: Determines the strength of a Pok\u00e9mon's physical [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attacks]].\n* {{nihongo4|'''Defense'''|\u307c\u3046\u304e\u3087|B\u014dgyo}}: Determines the Pok\u00e9mon's resistance against physical attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Special Attack'''|\u3068\u304f\u3053\u3046|Tokuk\u014d}}: Determines the power of a Pok\u00e9mon's special attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Special Defense'''|\u3068\u304f\u307c\u3046|Tokub\u014d}}: Determines the Pok\u00e9mon's resilience to special attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Speed'''|\u3059\u3070\u3084\u3055|Subayasa}}: After battle commands are entered, the Speed statistics of the participating Pok\u00e9mon are compared. With some exceptions, Pok\u00e9mon with higher Speed make their moves before those with lower Speed.\n\nThere are also two other statistics, {{nihongo4|Accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d\u7387|Meich\u016britsu}} and {{nihongo4|Evasiveness|\u56de\u907f\u7387|Kaihiritsu}}, which are not affected when Pok\u00e9mon level up. No Pok\u00e9mon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pok\u00e9mon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called \"Evade\" in the first generation and \"Evasion\" in the second.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'', both the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were a single stat, named the \"Special\" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/pokemon-red-blue-things-wrong/|title=25 Things Wrong With Pok\u00e9mon Red And Blue Everyone Chooses To Ignore|date=29 March 2019|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pok\u00e9mon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pok\u00e9mon's base stat values, effort values, Pok\u00e9mon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each Pok\u00e9mon with its unique stats.\n\n=== Base stat values ===\nThe Base stat values determine the natural statistical strengths of the various Pok\u00e9mon species. Every species is assigned a number in each of the six stats; the higher the number, the higher the stat can potentially be. While these values may greatly vary between species, they are the same for each member of that species. It is the difference among species which explains why all [[List of generation I Pok\u00e9mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] will have a higher Speed than any [[Snorlax]] of the same level; however, it is the combination of other factors that causes some Snorlax to be faster than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/smog/issue6/base_stats|title=Base Stat Ratings - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Adding up all the base stat values for a certain species generates the base stat total, which players use to determine approximately how strong that species is.\n\n=== Effort values ===\n{{nihongo4|Effort values|\u52aa\u529b\u5024|doryokuchi|EVs}} are hidden values that affect the strengths of a Pok\u00e9mon in particular statistical areas. Differing effort value levels between two Pok\u00e9mon can create a significant difference in the two Pok\u00e9mon's statistical strengths. When a Pok\u00e9mon battles and defeats an opponent, they gain experience points and also receive a number and type of EVs according to the defeated Pok\u00e9mon's species. Every defeated Pok\u00e9mon gives at least one EV to each of the Pok\u00e9mon that fought it. Certain factors, like holding the Macho Brace item, can increase the rate at which EVs are gained in battle. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], a condition known as {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9rus|\u30dd\u30b1\u30eb\u30b9|Pokerusu}} was introduced which doubles the rate at which EVs are obtained, and will be contagious for a certain number of days, allowing it to spread to other Pok\u00e9mon. Also, consuming certain items can increase a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs, and certain Berries decrease EVs while increasing a Pok\u00e9mon's friendship value. There is a limit on the number of EVs Pok\u00e9mon can have, which prevents stats from increasing indefinitely. The total limit allows for maximum Effort Values in two stats simultaneously.\n\nIn the first- and second-generation games, a similar system usually referred to as Stat Experience or Stat Exp. was used. As with Effort Values, there is a limit to how much Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have in each stat; however, unlike Effort Values, there is no limit to the total Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have across all stats, meaning that a Pok\u00e9mon can have maximum Stat Exp. in every stat. Also of note is that, for Pok\u00e9mon from the first and second generation to be forward and backward compatible for trading, Stat Exp. was not tracked separately for Special Attack and Special Defense in the second generation games. Instead, the Special Stat Exp. value was used to calculate both Special Attack and Special Defense.\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], a minigame known as {{nihongo4|Super Training|\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec|Supatore}} is introduced that allows players to more accurately manage the effort values. The player can do this by playing a [[Association football|soccer]]-like minigame, which also rewards the player with training bags to continue the training passively. The Pok\u00e9mon's effort values can also be viewed in the Super Training interface, which includes an \"Effort-o-Meter\" to allow the player to see the maximum capability of increasing the Pok\u00e9mon's effort values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/super_training/ |title=Super Training |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/05.html |title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u3092\u7279\u8a13\u3060\uff01 \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u306e\u80b2\u3066\u65b9\u3001\u300c\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec\u300d\uff01\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], a graph of a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs along with its base stats can be seen by pressing the Y button while viewing the summary of a Pok\u00e9mon. A sparkling stat shows that the Pok\u00e9mon had obtained the maximum number of EVs for the stat. Pok\u00e9mon can gain EVs passively through a feature called \"Pok\u00e9 Pelago\".\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Natures ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Natures|\u6027\u683c|Seikaku}} were first introduced in ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a Nature, randomly assigned when it is generated, which cannot be changed. A Pok\u00e9mon's Nature affects the rate at which some of its stats increase: out of the twenty-five possible Natures, twenty will increase one stat's growth rate but decrease another's. The other five modify the same stat in both increases and decreases, and thus the Pok\u00e9mon's overall growth is unaffected.<ref name=\"smogon.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/ingame/guides/breeding_guide_part1|title=The Breeding Guide Part I - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Natures also determine which flavor of [[#Pok\u00e9mon Contests|Pok\u00e9blocks or Poffins]] that Pok\u00e9mon likes and dislikes.\n\n=== Individual values ===\n{{nihongo4|Individual values|\u500b\u4f53\u5024|kotaichi}} or IVs are a hidden value for each statistic which determine a Pok\u00e9mon's maximum potential. These values are randomly generated along with each Pok\u00e9mon when it is encountered or bred, and set in stone for the rest of the game. These hidden values are why even Pok\u00e9mon that seem identical and have been raised the same way may have different stats. IVs range from 0 to 31,<ref name=\"smogon.com\"/> and their Generations I and II predecessors, \"determinant values\", ranged from 0 to 15.\n\n== Items ==\nItems can be found in the world, given to the player by NPCs, or bought at shops for in-game currency.\n\n=== Recovery items ===\nMany items received in the game are used to heal Pok\u00e9mon during and outside of battles. A range of items cure various status conditions, such as Antidotes for poisoning and Awakenings for sleep. Revives restore a Pok\u00e9mon back to health after it has lost all of its HP. Ethers and Elixirs restore the PP of a Pok\u00e9mon's moves to varying degrees.\n\n=== Technical and Hidden Machines ===\n{{nihongo4|Technical Machines|\u308f\u3056\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Waza Mashin}} and {{nihongo4|Hidden Machines|\u3072\u3067\u3093\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Hiden Mashin}}, commonly abbreviated as TMs and HMs, can be used to teach moves to Pok\u00e9mon, including some moves that they would otherwise not learn by increasing in level. TMs are commonly found in the field, in shops, and as rewards for defeating a Gym Leader. HMs are often vital to game progression as they have important effects outside of battle, allowing the player to traverse certain obstacles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon who learn the HM move Surf can transport the protagonist over water, which is necessary to reach island locations. When a Pok\u00e9mon learns an HM move, the move cannot be deleted or replaced unless the player uses the services of an NPC known as the Move Deleter.  \n\n=== Key items ===\nKey items are rarer than regular items and are usually given to the player rather than found. These include [[fishing rod]]s which are used to find water-dwelling Pok\u00e9mon, a bicycle which allows the protagonist to move around faster, a dowsing machine, and keys which open locked doors leading to important areas. These items cannot be thrown away, sold, or given to a Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Held items ===\nStarting with [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], each Pok\u00e9mon is able to hold a single item. Items carried by Pok\u00e9mon can have a range of effects. Some, like Berries, are consumed after one use and boost HP or stats. Others persistently boost move power, defense, Speed, and more. Just like moves, some items hinder the user to compensate their power; for instance, the Life Orb boosts the damage of the holder's attacks, but hurts it after each successful attack. Others items solely harm the user except in rare situations, such as the Toxic Orb, which badly poisons it. [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|Pok\u00e9mon ''X'' and ''Y'']] introduced Mega Stones used to [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] members of the stone's species, and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced Z-Crystals, which give the holder access to Z-Moves. Items like the Razor Claw and Razor Fang [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] certain Pok\u00e9mon when held while a condition is met. Most items, including [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s and [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Items|Potions]], can be held but have no effect when given to a Pok\u00e9mon. Items can be moved between, removed from, and neutralized on Pok\u00e9mon through moves like Trick, Knock Off, and Embargo, or consumed to damage the opponent through the attacks Fling and Natural Gift.  \n\n== Catching Pok\u00e9mon ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9ball.png|thumb|left|150px|The standard Pok\u00e9 Ball is a well-known icon of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' franchise.]]\nBecause each player begins the game with only one starter Pok\u00e9mon, catching is one of the most fundamental aspects of Pok\u00e9mon, and the primary method of recruiting new Pok\u00e9mon to the player's party.\n\nIn a battle against a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to catch it by using one of many different types of [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s. The odds of success vary, but are increased if the target Pok\u00e9mon's HP is low, if the target is affected by a status-altering effect like sleep or paralysis, and if a stronger or specially-suited Pok\u00e9 Ball is used.\n\nIf the catch is successful, the caught Pok\u00e9mon's data is added to the [[#Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9dex]], the player may give the Pok\u00e9mon a nickname, and the Pok\u00e9mon is added to the player's party. However, if the player's party is filled to its maximum of six Pok\u00e9mon, the caught Pok\u00e9mon is instead sent to a storage box accessible at Pok\u00e9mon Centers. In the first- and second-generation games, if the current PC box is full, the player will be unable to catch any new Pok\u00e9mon until he or she accesses a PC and switches to a different box. In more recent games, new Pok\u00e9mon are automatically transferred to the next available box.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9 Ball ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9 Ball'''|\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Monsut\u0101b\u014dru|\"Monster Ball\"}} is a spherical device used by Pok\u00e9mon Trainers to catch wild Pok\u00e9mon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pok\u00e9mon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pok\u00e9mon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pok\u00e9mon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily caught. [[Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] are much more capable of resisting being caught, and will often require many Pok\u00e9 Balls or more powerful Pok\u00e9 Balls to catch them. If the player attempts to catch a non-player character's Pok\u00e9mon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft. Ultra beasts require a different pokeball altogether.\n\nAs depicted in the anime and manga series, the Pok\u00e9 Ball, when not in use, is the size of a [[golf ball]] and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a [[baseball]]. The Pok\u00e9mon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pok\u00e9mon, a beam of red light converts the Pok\u00e9mon into energy to reclaim it. Pok\u00e9 Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pok\u00e9mon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hilliard |first1=Kyle |last2=Masuda |first2=Junichi |date=December 2012 |title=Pok\u00e9mon's Burning Questions |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=236 |pages=112}}</ref> The Pok\u00e9mon [[Voltorb]], [[Electrode (Pok\u00e9mon)|Electrode]], [[Foongus]], and [[Amoonguss]] are often mistaken for Pok\u00e9 Balls, due to their shape and color schemes which highly resemble Pok\u00e9 Balls.\n\nVarious types of Pok\u00e9 Balls exist. Introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] are the Pok\u00e9 Ball, {{nihongo4|Great Ball|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|S\u016bp\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Super Ball\"}}, {{nihongo4|Ultra Ball|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Haip\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Hyper Ball\"}}, and {{nihongo4|Master Ball|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Masut\u0101 B\u014dru}}. The Master Ball always succeeds against any Pok\u00e9mon that can be caught, and of which typically only one is available in the game. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], there are fruits called '''Apricorns''', which, when given to Kurt in Azalea Town, make one of seven special types of Pok\u00e9 Balls, depending on the Apricorn's color. The seven kinds of Pok\u00e9 Balls Kurt can make (and the seven color Apricorns they are made out of) are Level (Red), Moon (Yellow), Lure (Blue), Friend (Green), Love (Pink), Fast (White), and Heavy (Black). Beginning in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', and ''Emerald'']], other specialized balls appear, including the Timer Ball, which becomes more effective as the number of turns in the current battle rises, and the Net Ball, which has a better chance of catching Water and Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, among others. In addition, in several games there exists an area called the Safari Zone in which only Safari Balls can be used; these cannot be obtained or used elsewhere in the game. [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced the Beast Ball, which is designed for capturing Ultra Beasts and is much more effective at capturing them than standard Pok\u00e9 Balls. There is also a special kind of Pok\u00e9 Ball known as the Cherish Ball, which can only be obtained through special distribution events.\n\nIn the [[Nintendo GameCube]] RPGs, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', the player is able to catch non-player characters' Pok\u00e9mon through the use of the Snag Machine, which turns Pok\u00e9 Balls into Snag Balls. Snag Balls are capable of catching any Pok\u00e9mon, and are developed by the antagonists to steal Pok\u00e9mon where they are not common in the wild. Snag Balls can also be used by the player to catch Shadow Pok\u00e9mon who have been tainted by the antagonist group and that the player is required to purify for game completion.\n\nPok\u00e9 Balls have appeared in every installment of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, releasing a Pok\u00e9mon to assist the player who grabbed it. ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' also introduces the Master Ball, which almost always releases a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, with a small chance of releasing Goldeen instead.\n\n[[UGO.com]] listed the Pok\u00e9 Ball eighteenth on their list of \"Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups\" citing how everybody runs to get it in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |title=Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups - UGO.com |publisher=[[UGO.com]] |author=Chris Littler |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019184843/http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |archivedate=2010-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n[[Category:Fictional items which are larger inside than outside]]\n\n=== Pok\u00e9dex ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9dex'''|[[:ja:\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451]]|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan|lit. \"Pok\u00e9mon Encyclopedia\"}} is an [[electronics|electronic]] device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pok\u00e9mon.

Each region has its own Pok\u00e9dex, which differ in appearance, species of Pok\u00e9mon catalogued, and functions such as the ability to sort the list of Pok\u00e9mon based on [[alphabetical order]] or display the Pok\u00e9mon's size compared to the player character. The \"National Pok\u00e9dex\" allows Pok\u00e9mon from all regions to be catalogued. The Nintendo 3DS application ''[[Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro]]'' features all of the Pok\u00e9mon with all of its forms and each one has its own animation.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon evolution ==\n[[File:Pokemon evolution.png|right|thumb|150px|A series of screenshots depicting an [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Abra evolving into a Kadabra]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald''.]]\n\n{{nihongo4|Evolution|\u9032\u5316|shinka}} is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in [[#Stats|stat]] values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Friendship|friendship]] level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\nThe player can choose to halt evolution at any time before the animation is finished by pressing the B button, unless the evolution was initiated by using an evolutionary stone on the Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon whose evolutions are canceled will attempt to evolve again after the condition for evolution is met again. Preventing evolution for a time can be useful, as many Pok\u00e9mon learn moves sooner in their unevolved form than in their evolved form.\n\nThe ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'' introduced the idea of numerical stages for referring to different points in a Pok\u00e9mon's evolution. This has translated into colloquial usage among fans of the games. All Pok\u00e9mon can be placed at one of four evolutionary stages (though no existing Pok\u00e9mon line includes more than three out of the four stages): Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 2 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|Baby Pok\u00e9mon]] which are acquired by breeding certain Basic or Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon and hatching their Eggs. A Pok\u00e9mon higher up on this evolutionary scale is sometimes called an evolved form of the previous stages; likewise, a Pok\u00e9mon lower down on the scale is said to be a pre-evolved form of later Pok\u00e9mon in the chain.\n\n=== Leveling up ===\nThis is the most common method of evolution across all Pok\u00e9mon generations, and involves Pok\u00e9mon acquiring experience points through battling other Pok\u00e9mon. \n\n=== Evolutionary stones ===\nEvolutionary stones are items which can be found throughout the games. Some Pok\u00e9mon can have particular evolutionary stones used on them, and doing so will cause the Pok\u00e9mon to evolve. Initially five evolutionary stones were introduced into the game: the Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon and Fire Stones. Later generations introduced more kinds, bringing the total to ten in Generation VII.\n\n=== Trading ===\nSome Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Machoke]] and [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Kadabra]], evolve when [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|traded]] between players. Additional evolutionary requirements can also exist; for instance, [[Seadra]] only evolves into [[Kingdra]] if it holds a Dragon Scale when traded, and [[Shelmet]] and [[Karrablast]] only evolve when traded for each other.\n\n=== Friendship ===\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|friendship|\u306a\u3064\u304d\u5ea6|Natsuki-do|lit. \"Degree of Emotional Attachment\"; nicknamed \"Happiness\" by players}} is an attribute that can rise or fall based upon several conditions and events. This aspect, introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'', determined Pikachu's stat growth and affected the outcome of certain NPC events. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] it is a means to evolve several Pok\u00e9mon. When Pok\u00e9mon like [[Chansey]] or [[Golbat]] level up and have very high Friendship, they will evolve.\n\nIn addition to its use in certain evolutions, the moves Return and Frustration base their power on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship value, with Return's power rising the higher the friendship value is and Frustration's power rising the lower the friendship level is.\n\n=== Affection ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], a feature known as {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9mon-Amie'''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30d1\u30eb\u30ec|Pokeparure|\"Pok\u00e9Parler\"}} was introduced; in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']], the feature is known as '''Pok\u00e9mon Refresh'''. It allows players to interact with and care for Pok\u00e9mon in a manner similar to some [[digital pet]] games. This minigame utilizes the touchscreen to allow players to pet their Pok\u00e9mon and feed them sweets to raise their affection value. In battle, Pok\u00e9mon with high Affection may turn to their Trainer to await orders and express emotions. Additionally, they can receive certain benefits such as an increased chance to land [[critical hit]]s if their affection reaches a high enough value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/pokemon_amie/ |title=At Play with Pok\u00e9mon-Amie! |publisher=pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/01.html |script-title=ja:\u304b\u308f\u3044\u304c\u3063\u3066\u7d46\u3092\u6df1\u3081\u308b\u3001\u300c\u30dd\u30b1\u30d1\u30eb\u30ec\u300d!\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05|language=Japanese}}</ref> Eevee must have high affection and must know a Fairy-type move to evolve into Sylveon.\n\n=== Mega Evolution ===\n{{For|the concept in biology|Megaevolution}}\n{{nihongo4|Mega Evolution|\u30e1\u30ac\u30b7\u30f3\u30ab|Mega Shinka}} is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], which further increases the abilities of specific Pok\u00e9mon.

The player cannot perform more than one Mega Evolution per battle. Unlike normal evolution, this transformation is temporary, and the Pok\u00e9mon will revert to its normal form after the battle.

The only Pok\u00e9mon capable of this transformation is [[Greninja]] with the Battle Bond Ability. Greninja will transform into Ash-Greninja if it knocks out a Pok\u00e9mon during battle, giving it an appearance similar to [[Ash Ketchum]], increased stats, and a stronger Water Shuriken. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, and Ultra Burst, Bond Phenomenon does not require an item to activate.\n\n=== Ultra Burst ===\nUltra Burst (\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8 ''Ultra Burst'') is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'']], exclusive to the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VII Pok\u00e9mon#Necrozma|Necrozma]]. Necrozma may undergo Ultra Burst if it is in its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form and holding the Ultranecrozium Z Z-Crystal, which will allow it to transform into Ultra Necrozma. Like Mega Evolution, Bond Phenomenon, and Primal Reversion, Ultra Burst increases Necrozma's stats and is a temporary transformation.\n\n=== Dynamax & Gigantamax ===\nDynamax (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Daimax'') and Gigantamax (\u30ad\u30e7\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Kyodaimax'') are mechanics introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']]. If the player character possesses an item called the Dynamax Band (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9 ''Daimax Band''), it drastically increases the Pok\u00e9mon's size, its HP by 50%, and can use Max Moves. The Pok\u00e9mon can further increase its HP by 5% from using Dynamax Candy (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30a2\u30e1''Daimax Candy'') to increase its Dynamax Level. Gigantamax is similar to Dynamax, but it changes the Pok\u00e9mon's form, similar to Mega Evolution. Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon use G-Max Moves, exclusive to the 26 Pok\u00e9mon capable of Gigantamaxing. Each Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon must have their respective move type in order to use their respective G-Max Move.

The Eevee will evolve into one of its three different evolved states depending on how well the player fares in battles with the rival at the beginning of the game.\n\n=== Legendary Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Densetsu no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a [[technical terminology|term of art]]. Since the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of the games, the main series' game package features one Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, usually the Pok\u00e9mon most involved in the main storyline of that game. Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are often described as being exceptionally rare. In most cases, Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are exceptionally powerful, difficult to catch, and unable to [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]], and no known Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is capable of [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]]. Many Legendary Pok\u00e9mon also lack a gender. Certain Legendary Pok\u00e9mon colloquially termed \"roaming Pok\u00e9mon\" randomly move around the world map and flee from battle, making them even harder to obtain.\n\n=== Mythical Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u5e7b\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Maboroshi no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a separate group of Pok\u00e9mon. The term is commonly associated with Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, requiring an external mechanic to obtain them; however, some Mythical Pok\u00e9mon have been made obtainable in later releases, notably [[Deoxys]]. These Pok\u00e9mon are usually placed at the end of their respective games' Pok\u00e9dex and can only be obtained through distribution events set up by Nintendo. The first of these Mythical Pok\u00e9mon was [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]], who was programmed into the ''Red'' and ''Green'' games as a secret character by [[Shigeki Morimoto]] without any knowledge of the other members of the development team, and was not announced until several months after the games' release in a special promotion. Since then, the games have continued to feature Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, but the programming that allow the player to catch them within the games can be activated by special items (or other Pok\u00e9mon) distributed by Nintendo. The first of these such items was the GS Ball in ''Crystal'', which was distributed to players in Japan through the mobile phone connector, allowing them to encounter [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]. Like Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Mythical Pok\u00e9mon are powerful and difficult to catch, are usually not part of an evolutionary line, and cannot breed (with the exception of [[Manaphy]]).\n\n=== Shiny Pok\u00e9mon ===\n[[File:ShinyZubatEncounter.JPG|thumb|left|The player finds a green Zubat in ''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version''.]]\n\n'''Shiny Pok\u00e9mon''' were first introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as a way to demonstrate the new color capabilities of the [[Game Boy Color]] system. These are Pok\u00e9mon which have a different coloration than normal; in earlier games, this was done by means of a [[palette swap]]. Encountering a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon is extremely rare; the probability under normal conditions is 1 in 8,192 (1 in 4,096 from the sixth generation onwards).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-mans-five-year-quest-to-find-a-shiny-pokemon-1603763304|title=One Man's Five-Year Quest To Find A Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> There are some major exceptions to this rule, such as a red [[Gyarados]] present in ''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'', ''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'', and three Pok\u00e9mon present in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], all of which are guaranteed to be Shiny.\n\nThere are various ways of increasing the chance of getting a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In second-generation games, breeding a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with a regular Pok\u00e9mon has a higher chance (1 in 64) of producing a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In ''Diamond'', ''Pearl'', ''Platinum'', ''X'', and ''Y'', the Pok\u00e9 Radar can be used to \"chain\" Pok\u00e9mon of the same species, improving the odds of a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with each link (up to 40 links, when the odds are 1 in 200). Since Generation IV, [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]] Pok\u00e9mon that originated in games of two different languages results in Eggs with a 1 in 1,638 (Generation IV games) or 1 in 1365 (Black and White onwards) chance to contain a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon; this method of increasing odds has been dubbed the \"Masuda method\" after developer [[Junichi Masuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-to-get-a-shiny-pokemon-in-pokemon-x-and-y |title=How to Get a Shiny Pokemon In Pokemon X and Y |last=Khaw |first=Cassandra |publisher=USgamer |access-date=2016-06-17}}</ref> Additionally, an item introduced in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called the Shiny Charm increases the probability of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. However, this item is only accessible long after completing the game, as the player must have completed the National Pok\u00e9dex (excluding Mythical Pok\u00e9mon). Beginning in ''Black'' and ''White'', certain Pok\u00e9mon in each game are 'Shiny-locked', meaning the player cannot obtain a Shiny variant of them in normal gameplay.\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|Pok\u00e9mon ''Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s SOS Battle mechanic created a new way to \"hunt\" for Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. If a wild Pok\u00e9mon calls allies to help and the ally is continually of the same species in a \"chain\", the chance that it calls a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon rises up to a base of 13 in 4096 after the 30th is called, as do the chances of Hidden Ability and perfect [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Stats|IVs]], though they are capped at four perfect IVs maximum. In their [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|sequels']] Ultra Warp Ride [[minigame]], by successfully traveling more [[light-year]]s through the wormhole and entering wormholes with more rings, the player can increase the chance of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the Ultra Space Wilds. Generation 7 also introduced an upgrade to the \"Masuda method\" referred to as \"Swap Breeding\"; the game is continually saved and soft-reset until a fast-hatching, dummy Pok\u00e9mon is hatched shiny within the first thirty attempts, and shininess is transplanted to the new Pok\u00e9mon hatched in the same position as the dummy was.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/6/8/17409856/shiny-pokemon-guide|title=How to build an army of competitive shiny Pok\u00e9mon|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', Shiny Pok\u00e9mon have slightly above-average stats, but this is because their Shininess is determined by their [[#Individual values|determinant values]] in those games. In the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Game Boy Advance era|third generation]] and onward, however, Shininess is determined by another value, and Shiny Pok\u00e9mon are not stronger than any other Pok\u00e9mon in battle. Most fans consider Shiny Pok\u00e9mon to be collectors' items because of their rarity.\n\nThe term \"Shiny\" was initially a term invented by the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' fan community due to the flash of stars that appear when such a Pok\u00e9mon enters a battle, implying a sheen property to the colors of the Pok\u00e9mon. The term \"Shiny Pok\u00e9mon\" was later officially acknowledged in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], but it has been used in the anime and in a few strategy guides before this. The term {{nihongo3|\"shining\"|\u5149\u308b|hikaru}} was also a widely used slang term in Japan; Ken Sugimori uses ''hikaru'' in the title of a piece of artwork featuring a Shiny Charizard. The alternate term {{nihongo4|\"Alt. Color\"|\u8272\u9055\u3044|Iro Chigai}} appears among the options the player can choose when filling out forms in the third generation of games.\n\nShiny Pok\u00e9mon have appeared in the anime, including the aforementioned red Gyarados and a Noctowl that protagonist Ash Ketchum catches. A pink Butterfree was also featured in an episode of the first season of the anime, but this alternate coloration is not what appears in the subsequent video games where the Shiny feature has been implemented.\n\n== Connectivity ==\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon trades ===\n[[File:Game Boy(RTSide).png|thumb|right|The game link port is located above the volume control on the original [[Game Boy]] handheld system.]]\n\nPlayers have the ability to trade their Pok\u00e9mon with one another by connecting two compatible games. Trading is an important aspect to the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games, being the crux upon which much of the franchise is based. This is because the slogan, and consequently the goal, \"Gotta catch 'em All,\" is logistically impossible without trading. Each game released in a [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Generations|generation]] has certain Pok\u00e9mon that are exclusive to that version. For example, in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' players can catch the Pok\u00e9mon [[Ekans]] and its evolved form, Arbok, while both are absent in the wild in both ''Pok\u00e9mon Blue'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''. Other Pok\u00e9mon are only available when offered up as a choice. The most obvious example is the choice between three [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] at the beginning of the game; the only way to get the other two is by trading. Some [[Non-player character|NPC]]s offer to trade Pok\u00e9mon with the player, allowing them to acquire Pok\u00e9mon otherwise unavailable without connecting to another game. For example, the only way to get a [[Jynx]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'' (other than trading with another game cartridge) is through an in-game trade. The other way that trading is made instrumental in gameplay is that some Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Haunter]] and [[Machoke]], only [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into their final forms when traded.\n\nTrading between games on the Game Boy and related systems is accomplished through a [[Game Link cable]] that attaches to ports found on all [[Game Boy line|Game Boy incarnations]]. The size of the ports varies between consoles, so several hybrid cables have been created that allow, for example, linking between the original [[Game Boy]] and the [[Game Boy Color]]. [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] include a special wireless dongle which plugs into the game link port for local wireless communication. On the [[Nintendo DS]], DS Wireless Communications is used instead.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;240\u2013245</ref> [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] also introduced the Global Trade Station/System (or GTS), a place where people all around the world may trade Pok\u00e9mon using the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. In the GTS hall, the player can input their own location and pinpoint the locations of other players they have interacted with. The Nintendo WFC records this data when they trade successfully with someone over the GTS or in their Pal Pad.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;254</ref> For the [[Nintendo 3DS family|Nintendo 3DS line]], two successors to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were implemented in each generation. In the Player Search System in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' & ''Y'']] and [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], the function is simply called Trade, while in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']] in the Festival Plaza, the function is called Link Trade. The second successor is called Wonder Trade; players choose a Pok\u00e9mon to trade and are randomly paired with another player around the world.\n\n== Mystery Gift ==\nMystery Gift, a means by which players can receive items from other people, was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] and has appeared in every handheld ''Pok\u00e9mon'' game since. To use Mystery Gift, the feature must first be activated in a specific way.\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', if two players line up the infrared ports on their [[Game Boy Color]] units and activate Mystery Gift from the intro menu, each will receive an item. This process also sends a record of each player's party Pok\u00e9mon to the other player's game for a daily event in Viridian City in which they can battle the other player's Pok\u00e9mon (controlled by the computer). Players can use Mystery Gift an unlimited number of times, but only once per day for each person. In addition, a player of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2]]'' with a ''Gold'', ''Silver'', or ''Crystal'' cartridge plugged into the [[Transfer Pak]] can use Mystery Gift with a girl in [[Pok\u00e9mon regions#Stadium regions|White City]]. A Mystery Gift can also be received by connecting with a [[Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu#Versions|Pocket Pikachu 2 GS]].\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], Mystery Gift is replaced with Mystery Event. This feature utilizes the now defunct [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] accessory. Using special [[Nintendo e-Reader#e-Reader cards|e-cards]], the player could obtain special items such as rare Berries or the Eon Ticket. In [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''LeafGreen'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|''Emerald'']], Mystery Gift is a means to obtain special items at Nintendo's promotional events through the use of the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]], which allow the player to catch otherwise unobtainable Pok\u00e9mon, such as [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] and [[Deoxys]].\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] expanded Mystery Gift to include a variety of transferring options. After enabling Mystery Gift, players may obtain items via wireless or [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], and may also transfer them to friends. Wireless connection also allows the player to transfer items from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution]]''. Currently, Mystery Gift via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Nintendo WFC]] has only been implemented in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]. However, this was changed when the shiny Pichu was distributed to all version games via WFC. Also, with the creation of the Pok\u00e9walker, in [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], came another way to Mystery Gift. By pressing the connect button on two Pok\u00e9walkers and pointing them at each other, both Pok\u00e9walkers will receive an item, which the player will receive upon connecting with his or her game. Beginning with [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], an option to receive Mystery Gifts by single-use serial code or password over [[Nintendo Network]] was added. Single-use codes are given out in participating retailers and via the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link and are usually region locked. Wireless and infrared events are no longer region locked, allowing any region console to receive events distributed by those methods.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Bank ===\n{{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u30af|Pok\u00e9mon Banku}} is an application which allows players to store up to 3,000 Pok\u00e9mon in an online [[cloud storage]] service. Players can deposit and withdraw Pok\u00e9mon from both physical and downloaded versions of compatible games, allowing players to exchange Pok\u00e9mon between the two versions without the need for a second system. Additionally, an application called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9 Transporter|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e0\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Poke M\u016bb\u0101|\"Pok\u00e9 Mover\"}} allows players to upload Pok\u00e9mon from ''Pok\u00e9mon Black'', ''White'', ''Black 2'', and ''White 2'' to the Pok\u00e9mon Bank, after which they can be imported into newer games.

The update, which came three days later, also added compatibility with the Virtual Console versions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal|Crystal]]'' (which was not re-released until January 26, 2018) to the Pok\u00e9 Transporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/17/pokmon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-will-get-pokmon-bank-compatibility-update-late-november/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon Will Get Pok\u00e9mon Bank Compatibility Update In Late November|website=Siliconera|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Home ===\nOn May 28, 2019, Pok\u00e9mon Home was revealed as the successor application to Pok\u00e9mon Bank. Scheduled for release in February 2020, the app will be available on [[Nintendo Switch]] and smartphone devices, and will have connectivity with Pok\u00e9mon Bank, [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Phillip|title=POK\u00c9MON HOME IS NEW POK\u00c9MON BANK THAT CONNECTS 'SWORD AND SHIELD, 'POK\u00c9MON GO' AND MORE|url=https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-home-bank-sword-shield-go-1437721}}</ref> Players can get a free version that can store up to 30 Pokemon, or they can buy the premium pass which will let them store up to 6,000, twice as much as ''Pokemon Bank''.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon breeding ==\nPok\u00e9mon breeding was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]. Pok\u00e9mon can be bred in-game at a {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Day Care|\u80b2\u3066\u5c4b|Sodateya}}. These are businesses generally run by an elderly person or couple, which raise Trainers' Pok\u00e9mon for a fee. If two compatible Pok\u00e9mon are left there, they will eventually produce a Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Egg|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4|tamago}}, which the Trainer can pick up for free. After being carried by the Trainer for some distance, the Egg will hatch into a young Pok\u00e9mon, usually of the lowest stage in its mother's [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolutionary line]].\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon have pre-evolutions that are usually only obtainable by hatching them from Eggs. Known as \"baby Pok\u00e9mon\", these Pok\u00e9mon are unable to breed but have evolutions that can breed baby Pok\u00e9mon. For most baby Pok\u00e9mon introduced after ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', the parent can only produce these Pok\u00e9mon when holding a certain item.<ref name=\"PBreeding\">Marcus, p.&nbsp;13</ref>\n\n=== Compatibility ===\nCompatibility is usually restricted to one male and one female. In addition, Pok\u00e9mon species are assigned to {{nihongo4|Egg Groups|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7|Tamago Gur\u016bpu}}, which determines their breeding compatibility with other species. Pok\u00e9mon may belong to up to two Egg Groups; in order to breed, they must share at least one Egg Group. Nearly all Pok\u00e9mon species, even those that are all-male or genderless, are able to breed with the shapeshifting Pok\u00e9mon [[Ditto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ditto]]. The Egg produced will yield a hatchling from the non-Ditto Pok\u00e9mon's evolutionary line. Two Ditto cannot breed to produce another Ditto.\n\nA select group of species cannot breed at all, which includes all Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, all Ultra Beasts, most Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Nidorina and Nidoqueen (but not Nidoran\u2640), Unown, and all \"baby\" Pok\u00e9mon. This is called the \"Undiscovered\" Egg Group. Although some Legendary Pok\u00e9mon have genders, they still cannot breed. An unusual circumstance involves the relation of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Manaphy and Phione; both can breed with Ditto to create an Egg which hatches into Phione, yet Phione does not evolve into Manaphy. Manaphy itself is obtained from an Egg from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Ranger]]'' games, but it will never breed to produce another Manaphy Egg.\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nPok\u00e9mon hatched from Eggs can {{nihongo4|inherit|\u907a\u4f1d|iden}} stats from their parents. Three of the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Individual values|individual values]] are inherited from one or the other of its parents, and the other three IVs are generated randomly.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\">Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;18.</ref>\n\nMoves can also be inherited through breeding. Moves that a newly hatched Pok\u00e9mon begins with are divided into three categories: learned moves, inherited moves, and hereditary moves or \"Egg Moves\". Learned moves are moves that the Pok\u00e9mon would have naturally at its starting level; inherited moves are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would be able to learn at later levels or through TMs; and {{nihongo4|Egg Moves|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u308f\u3056|Tamago Waza}}, inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y''), are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would not be able to learn normally. The Pok\u00e9mon can learn the move on this occasion as it receives the move from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pok\u00e9mon's move slots are filled with learned moves. However, if there are any inherited moves or Egg Moves available for the Pok\u00e9mon to learn, they replace the learned moves.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\" /><ref>Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;19.</ref>\n\n== Battle facilities ==\n{{redirect|Battle Frontier|the season of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]]|List of Pok\u00e9mon: Battle Frontier episodes}}\nIn addition to the Pok\u00e9mon Gyms and other battles to advance the plot, side games and post-game areas have been introduced in subsequent editions of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that extend the gameplay.\n\nFirst introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'', the {{nihongo4|Battle Tower|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc|Batoru Taw\u0101}} is a game feature accessible outside of the main storyline where the player faces several Trainers in succession with a limited set of their Pok\u00e9mon and receive prizes in the form of otherwise rare items. The Japanese version of ''Crystal'' which had a [[mobile phone]] adapter allowed for players to challenge other players to Battle Tower fights. The next Battle Towers appear in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], which is similar to the ''Crystal'' Battle Tower, and in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], which has a boss character and a point system similar to the Battle Frontiers.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Frontier|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2|Batoru Furontia}} was introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', replacing the Battle Tower as found in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games. In addition to having its own Battle Tower with the same rules as the previous ones, the Battle Frontier adds several other game mechanics that make [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battles]] unique in the end game. Examples include the Battle Palace's prohibition on choosing what moves the Pok\u00e9mon uses and the Battle Factory's random rental Pok\u00e9mon. Instead of prizes, the player is awarded Battle Points (BP) which can be traded for rare items or TMs. The ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' Battle Tower uses this same system, and it is replaced by a Battle Frontier in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]''. The [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games also have a Battle Frontier, identical to that of the ''Platinum'' version, where the Battle Tower was found in ''Crystal''. After a series of battles in each venue, players encounter {{nihongo4|[[Frontier Brains]]|\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3|Furontia Bur\u0113n}} who are challenged in the same fashion as all other battles, and the player will either earn a {{nihongo4|Symbol|\u30b7\u30f3\u30dc\u30eb|Shinboru|''Emerald''}} or a {{nihongo4|Commemorative Print|\u304d\u306d\u3093\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8|Kinen Purinto|''Platinum'', ''HeartGold'', ''SoulSilver''}} for winning. The Frontier Brains can be challenged a second time to more advanced versions of the Symbols or Prints (advancing from Silver to Gold). The Frontier Brains have very powerful Pok\u00e9mon, often including [[#Legendary Pok\u00e9mon|Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]], making a victory even more difficult than in the main storyline.\n\n''Emerald'' also features {{nihongo4|Battle Tents|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8|Batoru Tento}}, which allow the player to encounter some of the unique battle mechanics of three of the Battle Frontier venues. Rather than Battle Points, the player is awarded with an item that is rare or expensive.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Subway|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4|Batoru Sabuwei}} is unique to the [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']] games and serves as the games' Battle Tower, taking on the form of a [[Rapid transit|subway]] to match the games' [[New York City]]-styled setting. In the same vein as the Battle Tower in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' and the various Battle Frontiers, players earn BP and after a certain number of battles they challenge one or both of the two Subway Bosses ({{nihongo4|Subway Masters|\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Sabuwei Masut\u0101}} in Japan), depending on what type of battles (Single, Double, or Multi) the player was competing in.\n\nThe Battle Subway returns in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], but it is joined by two new sets of areas. The first one introduced in the games is the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon W\u0101rudo T\u014dnamento}}, wherein the player participates in a tournament-style setting with various NPC Trainers, set to a particular theme of a level limit, using randomly assigned teams, or using teams downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, to earn BP. The more advanced side of the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament is a tournament-style setting in battling the Gym Leaders and Pok\u00e9mon League Champions from all over the Pok\u00e9mon World, enabling players to challenge characters such as Brock and Misty from ''Red'' and ''Blue'', Volkner from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Lance from ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', or Steven from ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Also introduced in the games are the {{nihongo4|Black Tower|\u9ed2\u306e\u6469\u5929\u697c|Kuro no Matenr\u014d}} in ''Black 2''{{'}}s Black City and the {{nihongo4|White Treehollow|\u767d\u306e\u6a39\u6d1e|Shiro no Jud\u014d}} in ''White 2''{{'}}s White Forest. In these facilities, the player must battle a series of Trainers without using items, and only relying on Doctor or Nurse Trainers to restore their team's health. At the end, the player challenges the leader and later is awarded a rare Pok\u00e9mon for succeeding.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Maison|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9|Batoru Hausu|\"Battle House\"}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']], and can only be accessed after the player completes the main story. Similar to the Battle Frontier and the Battle Subway, there are different types of battling methods to choose from: single, double, triple, rotation, and multi battles. Then the player is drawn to a tournament where he/she is challenged to numerous battles with random Trainers. After winning a battle the player receives one BP (battle point) which can later be used to by items, vitamins, and TMs. After winning 21 battles the player must battle the strongest Trainer or referred to as the Battle Chatelaine. It depends on what battle style you choose. If the player beats 50 Trainers, they have the chance to battle one of the Battle Chatelaines again. Only this time do they use legendary Pok\u00e9mon (e.g. Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno). Another similar feature is the {{nihongo4|Battle Chateau|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30c8\u30fc|Batoru Shat\u014d}}, where the player advances through a ranking system based on the [[French nobility]] system after battling increasingly difficult Trainers, including being able to battle the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Champion in the same system.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'', the Battle Maison returns, but the Battle Frontier, which was featured in the original ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games, is hinted to be in production. The Battle Maison is very similar to the one in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'', but TMs (Technical Machines) cannot be bought; they are replaced by other items.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Royal|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Battle Royal}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], which involves four Trainers all battling each other at the same time. After becoming Champion, the player is given access to the {{nihongo4|Battle Tree|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc|Battle Tree}} on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is similar to the Battle Maison, Battle Subway, and Battle Towers from the previous generations. On the 20th battle of normal challenges and 50th battle of Super challenges, a powerful Trainer known as a Battle Legend will be challenged.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon Competitions ==\nIn addition to battling, several Pok\u00e9mon competitions have been introduced throughout the series to provide an alternate set of mini-games.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Contests ===\n{{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Contests|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon Kontesuto}} are competitions of skill among Pok\u00e9mon Trainers and their Pok\u00e9mon partners. Pok\u00e9mon Contests are different from [[Pok\u00e9mon battle]]s, testing talent rather than power. They were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and later appeared in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Omega Ruby'', and ''Alpha Sapphire'']].\n\nThere are five categories that a Pok\u00e9mon can be entered into: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough, and Smart. In addition, there are four ranks of contests: Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master Rank. To enter, a Trainer must go to the contest hall that holds contests of the appropriate rank, and in ranks higher than Normal, the participating Pok\u00e9mon must have won the contest of the selected category in the previous rank. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Contests are renamed Super Contests, and the four ranks are named Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;227</ref>\n\nIn the first round (called \"Visual Competition\" in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'') the Pok\u00e9mon is shown to the audience, who then vote on their favorite. Pok\u00e9mon will gain more points here if they have good condition in the selected category, which can be increased by using Pok\u00e9blocks. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Pok\u00e9blocks are replaced by Poffins, and the player can also use the stylus to dress up their Pok\u00e9mon in certain {{nihongo4|Accessories|\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc|Akusesar\u012b}} to fit the theme of the contest.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;229\u2013233</ref>\n\nThe second round, called \"Dance Competition\", was introduced in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. The participating Pok\u00e9mon join in a dance routine. The leading Pok\u00e9mon gets rated based on following the rhythm, and the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon have to mimic the leader's steps. All four participants take turns to be the leader.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;234</ref>\n\nThe final round (\"Acting Competition\") comprises a few rounds, and the Pok\u00e9mon are ordered in sequence based on their performance in the previous round. Each round, the player chooses one Pok\u00e9mon move to perform before the judge, and in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' players also choose which of three judges to appeal to. Each move has a category, appeal value, and effect. Using a good combination will gain the Pok\u00e9mon more appeal points, but using the same move twice consecutively will be less effective. Moves can have many effects, such as \"jamming\" previous Pok\u00e9mon to reduce their appeal, or randomizing the order of appeals in the next round.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;235\u2013236</ref> After appeals are concluded, the results are shown, and the Pok\u00e9mon with the most total points wins a ribbon.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;237</ref>\n\n==== Pok\u00e9blocks and Poffins ====\nPok\u00e9blocks ({{nihongo4|Polock|\u30dd\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Porokku}}), introduced in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', are [[candy]]-like treats used to increase the contest condition and Loyalty of Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9blocks are created from Berries in the \"Berry Blender\" minigame, which can be played by two to four human or computer-controlled players. The types of berries blended by all participants affect the category and effectiveness of the resulting Pok\u00e9block. Pok\u00e9blocks are also used in the games' Safari Zone to attract wild Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n{{nihongo4|Poffins|\u30dd\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3|Pofin}}, a type of baked goods, were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] as replacements for Pok\u00e9blocks. Poffins are made by adding a Berry to some batter in a pot, and stirring it with a stylus using the [[Nintendo DS]]'s touch screen. Poffins can be mixed only with human partners and can be done solo or with two to four players wirelessly.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9athlon ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], the contest minigame is replaced with an athletic competition called the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9athlon|\u30dd\u30b1\u30b9\u30ed\u30f3|Pokesuron}}. The competitions range from [[track and field]] events such as [[hurdling]] or a [[relay race]] to a [[snowball fight]] and a game resembling [[pachinko]].\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon's stats may be increased by consuming {{nihongo4|\"Aprijuice\"|\u30dc\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af|Bon Dorinku|\"Bon Drink\"}} made from fruits known as Apricorns that the player can find throughout the world. By putting a number of Apricorns in a [[blender]] and making the player character run a certain number of steps, the Apricorns are mixed into a [[milkshake]]-like blend. The process can be repeated multiple times, each time adding more Apricorns to the mixture and running to blend them. The number of times this is done, along with the variety of Apricorns used, affects the type and effectiveness of the resulting Aprijuice. Aprijuice will increase one of five additional statistics that only exist for the Pok\u00e9athlon which consist of Speed, Power, Skill, Jump, and Stamina.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Musicals ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], the contest minigame is replaced by the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Musicals|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb|Pok\u00e9mon My\u016bjikaru}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Rather than grooming Pok\u00e9mon with Pok\u00e9blocks, Poffins, or Aprijuice, the player's Pok\u00e9mon is only dressed in Accessories which can be waved around on stage when the Pok\u00e9mon dances to various pieces of music; the player does not control the Pok\u00e9mon during this time, other than Appealing with special props. If the audience likes the performance, they give more props to the player in person post-performance. The player can, in fact, control the camera angle during the performance.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9star Studios ===\nAnother minigame is added in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9star Studios|\u30dd\u30b1\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9|Pokeuddo|\"Pok\u00e9wood\"}}. The player joins the cast of a movie and participates in a mock battle with a [[chroma key]] opponent, while picking line options that match the script of the film and completing an objective within a particular set of turns. Depending on how well the player performs according to the script, they will receive items from the film premiere's audience and unlock more movies to participate in.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters|List of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' characters]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Version: the official strategy guide from Nintendo Power|date=2006-08-24|publisher=Nintendo Power|author=Nintendo Power}}\n* {{cite book|title=Pok\u00e9mon Emerald: Official Strategy Guide|date=2006-08-24|publisher=Prima Games|author=Buchanan, B}}\n* {{cite book|title=Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version [and] Pok\u00e9mon Ruby Version|publisher=Prima Games|year=2003|isbn=0-7615-4256-6|author=Hollinger, Elizabeth M.|url=https://archive.org/details/pokemonrubyversi00holl}}\n* {{cite book|title=''Pok\u00e9mon Crystal'' Version|publisher=Prima Games|year=2001|isbn=0-7615-3666-3|author=Hollinger, Elizabeth M.}}\n* The instruction booklet of ''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond Version''.

Each successive [[Pok\u00e9mon#Generations|generation]] of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pok\u00e9mon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|anime]] long before appearing in the games, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Pok\u00e9mon Abilities]] are similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Powers introduced in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', which also introduced [[#Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|Shiny Pok\u00e9mon]], different colors of that type of the original Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon with very high stats and good moves are used in [[Pok\u00e9mon competitive play]], which requires more complex strategies than picking supereffective moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/strategy/making-the-jump-to-video-game-competitive-play/|title=Making the Jump to Video Game Competitive Play - Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Game structure ==\nEach game in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series takes place in a fictional region of the Pok\u00e9mon world and begins with the player receiving a [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] from that region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor. By traveling around the world, [[#Catching Pok\u00e9mon|catching]] and [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolving]] Pok\u00e9mon, and defeating other Trainers in [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battle]], the player increases the size and strength of their Pok\u00e9mon collection. A major subplot of each game is to defeat a [[criminal organization]], whose intents are usually trying to take over the world through the misuse of Pok\u00e9mon. These organizations include [[Team Rocket]], Neo Team Rocket, [[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]], [[Team Galactic]], [[Team Plasma]], Neo Team Plasma, [[Team Flare]], [[Team Skull]], [[Team Rainbow Rocket]], the [[Aether Foundation]], [[Team Yell]], and [[Macro Cosmos]].\n\nVarious facilities can be found throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world such as Pok\u00e9mon Centers, Pok\u00e9 Marts, and Gyms. At a Pok\u00e9mon Center, the player can have their Pok\u00e9mon healed for free and access the PC, where players can organize their collection of Pok\u00e9mon, store and withdraw items, and have their Pok\u00e9dex rated. Before ''X'' and ''Y'', this is also where players can link up with other game cartridges or cards to battle or [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|trade]] with other players. Pok\u00e9 Marts are shops where players can buy [[#Items|items]] with the money they win during battles; certain cities may have specialized shops, like a pharmacy or a department store. Periodically, a town will contain a [[#Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|Pok\u00e9mon Gym]], which houses a powerful Trainer known as a [[Gym Leader]]. Victory against them grants the player a Gym Badge; after collecting eight Gym Badges, the player may challenge the region's [[Elite Four]] and Champion. Gyms are absent in ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'' , and ''Ultra Moon'', being replaced by trials which serve a similar purpose. Upon completion of a Trial, the player receives a Z-Crystal, which grants a Pok\u00e9mon access to an extremely powerful move called a Z-Move. The trend of Gyms continues in ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\nCompleting the main storyline opens up other features in the games; this is primarily done by allowing passage into otherwise inaccessible places. Afterward, the game remains virtually open-ended, with the ultimate goal of the player being to obtain at least one member of each of the different species of Pok\u00e9mon, thus completing the [[Pok\u00e9dex]]. The number of Pok\u00e9mon increases with each game generation, starting from 151 in the first generation to 890 as of ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Gyms ===\n{{nihongo|Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e0|Pok\u00e9mon Jimu}} are buildings situated throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world, where Pok\u00e9mon Trainers can train or compete to qualify for Pok\u00e9mon League competitions. Although the internal organizations of Pok\u00e9mon Gyms may vary, the majority specialize in one certain type of Pok\u00e9mon, and all are manned by a {{nihongo4|[[Gym Leader]]|\u30b8\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Jimu R\u012bd\u0101}}, a formidable Trainer that acts as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Pok\u00e9mon Gyms can be found in many towns and cities in the Pok\u00e9mon world.\n\nIn each Gym, there are various Gym Trainers that the player may face before battling the Gym Leader. These Gym Trainers are often placed so that the player is forced into battle with them. When a Trainer defeats a Gym Leader in battle, the former wins a {{nihongo4|Badge|\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8|Bajji}}, which serves as proof of a Trainer's skill and is a key part of advancing the plot. In ''Sword'' and ''Shield'', a Trainer must complete a Gym Challenge, which is essentially a minigame, in order to continue through the Gym. Also, this will earn the former a [[Technical and Hidden Machines|Technical Machine]] (prior to ''Sun'' and ''Moon''), which allows the player to teach their Pok\u00e9mon a certain move. It also usually enables the player to utilize the overworld effects of one of the various Hidden Machines, such as the ability to cross bodies of water with the move Surf or the ability to remove some trees from paths with the move Cut. As the player collects Gym Badges, the maximum level at which traded Pok\u00e9mon obey their commands increases. \n\nAfter a player defeats the eight Gym Leaders, they can travel through Victory Road, and then proceed to the Pok\u00e9mon League and challenge the {{nihongo4|[[Elite Four]]|\u56db\u5929\u738b|Shitenn\u014d}} and the region's Pok\u00e9mon League {{nihongo4|Champion|\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3|Champion}}. Defeating the Champion is considered to be the goal of the game.\n\n=== Island Trials ===\nIn ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'', there are no Gyms or Gym Leaders. The player is instead given various \"trials\" by characters known as Trial Captains. A trial usually presents the player with a task they must complete to summon a Totem Pok\u00e9mon, a more powerful version of a certain species of Pok\u00e9mon. Once the player has summoned and defeated the Totem Pok\u00e9mon, they receive a Z-Crystal, an item that allows Pok\u00e9mon to use powerful moves known as \"Z-Moves\". Completing all of the trials on an island allows the player to challenge that island's \"kahuna\" in a standard Pok\u00e9mon battle. The player can challenge the Pok\u00e9mon League after they have completed all four Grand Trials. After defeating the Elite Four, the player can defend their title as Champion by defeating a challenger.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon battles ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9mon FireRed first battle.png|left|frame|In a battle scene in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version]]'', the Pok\u00e9mon at the top right of the screen is the opponent's; the bottom left is the player's. The player's options are shown at the bottom right.]]\n\nBattles between Pok\u00e9mon are the central game mechanic of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games. They are used to train Pok\u00e9mon to become stronger, like competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players by connecting two games.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon'' uses a [[turn-based]] system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the screen changes to a battle scene with the player's Pok\u00e9mon, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon, their respective [[Health (gaming)|HP]] bars, and an option menu. At any time, the player may carry up to six Pok\u00e9mon in his or her active party; the first Pok\u00e9mon in the lineup is automatically sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attack]], use an [[#Items|item]], switch the Pok\u00e9mon for another in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pok\u00e9mon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first is determined by [[#Stats|Speed]], although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other option, that action is performed before the attacks.\n\nEach Pok\u00e9mon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|faints|\u3072\u3093\u3057|hinshi}} and is unable to battle. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon wins, it receives [[experience point]]s; when enough have accumulated, the Pok\u00e9mon's level increases. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon faints, he/she may use another Pok\u00e9mon; in battles against wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If all of a player's Pok\u00e9mon faint, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return to the last Pok\u00e9mon Center they visited.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond Version'' instruction booklet. p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] introduced {{nihongo4|Double Battles|\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Daburu Batoru}}, in which the opposing teams battle with two Pok\u00e9mon at a time. Though the basic mechanics remain the same, moves may have multiple targets, and some affect the ally as well as the opponents. Additionally, some [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]] work only in Double Battles. {{nihongo4|Multi Battles|\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Maruchi Batoru}} were also introduced, with four Trainers in teams of two. The third-generation games only included Double Battles against other Trainers, but [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] introduced Double Battles with wild Pok\u00e9mon under certain circumstances.\n\n''Black'' and ''White'' also introduced Triple Battles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02.html|title=\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and Rotation Battles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-02.html|title=\u30ed\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In {{nihongo4|Triple Battles|\u30c8\u30ea\u30d7\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Toripuru Batoru}}, both teams send out three Pok\u00e9mon at once, with all three battling simultaneously. In {{nihongo4|Rotation Battles|\u30ed\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|R\u014dt\u0113shon Batoru}}, both sides send out three Pok\u00e9mon at once, but only use one at a time. The Pok\u00e9mon which is battling can be switched out with the other two without using up a turn.\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']] introduced three new battling mechanics. {{nihongo4|Sky Battles|\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Sukai Batoru}} are performed against Sky Trainers and can only be performed with Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon or those with the Levitate Ability. {{nihongo4|Horde Encounters|\u7fa4\u308c\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Mure Batoru|\"Group Battle\"}} are battles where five wild Pok\u00e9mon attack at once, encouraging the use of moves that hit multiple targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/new_battles/ |title=New Ways to Battle! |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/battle/02.html |title=\u300c\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u300d\u3068\u300c\u7fa4\u308c\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u300d\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421350/pokemon-x-and-ys-horde-battles-and-sky-battles-revealed |title=Pokemon X and Y's Horde Battles and Sky Battles revealed |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref> {{nihongo4|Inverse Battles|\u3055\u304b\u3055\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Sakasa Batoru|\"Reverse Battle\"}} are like normal battles, but the entire [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|type]] chart is inverted. This means that an attack which would normally deal double damage instead deals half damage, and vice versa.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'' also introduce a new battle type, the SOS Battle. In these battles, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon may call for allies to assist them, making the battle two-on-one against the player.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon types ===\n[[File:Pokemon Type Chart.svg|thumb|275px|This chart shows the current eighteen Pok\u00e9mon types (as of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'') and their strengths, weaknesses, and immunities against one another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-x-and-pokemon-y/|title=Pok\u00e9mon X and Pok\u00e9mon Y &#124; Video Games & Apps|website=www.pokemon.com}}</ref>]]\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|type|\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7|taipu}} is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pok\u00e9mon and its moves. Pok\u00e9mon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves they resist. These type matchups offset one another in [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]]-style relationships. Some Pok\u00e9mon types grant full immunity to certain attack types; for instance, Ghost types take no damage from Normal or Fighting-type moves. Some Pok\u00e9mon Abilities can change these interactions, such as Levitate making Pok\u00e9mon immune to Ground-type moves.\n\nIn the original ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'' games, there are a total of 15 Pok\u00e9mon types: Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, and Dragon. The Dark and Steel types were added in ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', and the Fairy type was introduced in ''X'' and ''Y''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/why-game-freak-introduced-the-fairy-type-in-pokemon-512779904|title=Why Game Freak Introduced The Fairy Type In Pokemon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.\n\nThe console RPGs ''Colosseum'' and ''XD'' featured a unique move type known as Shadow, but it does not appear outside these games. Shadow Pok\u00e9mon can be considered to be of this type, but they still retain their regular typing as well. In ''Pok\u00e9mon XD'', Shadow moves are super effective against non-Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and not very effective against Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon moves ===\nLike the characters in many [[role-playing video game]]s, Pok\u00e9mon can learn a wide variety of {{nihongo4|moves|\u6280|waza}}. These moves may inflict damage, induce status problems, restore health, or perform actions that in some way affect the battle. The general strength of and resistance to these moves are determined by the various [[#Stats|statistics]] a particular Pok\u00e9mon has. All moves have a type, {{nihongo4|power|\u5a01\u529b|Iryoku}}, accuracy, and a number of Power Points (PP). The moves that one Pok\u00e9mon may learn are different from another depending on the species of Pok\u00e9mon; even those that [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] from others do not necessarily learn all the same moves that their predecessors learn. Each Pok\u00e9mon may only know a total of four moves at any one time. Moves may be learned through leveling up, using [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|TMs and HMs]], [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]], and move tutors ([[Non-player character|NPC]]s that teach moves).\n\nEach move is classified as one of the 18 [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|Pok\u00e9mon types]]. The effectiveness of a move is dependent on how susceptible the target Pok\u00e9mon's type is to the move's type. Phrases associated with this aspect are \"It's super effective!\" (damage is at least doubled), \"It's not very effective\u2026\" (damage is at least halved), and \"It doesn't affect [defending Pok\u00e9mon]...\" (damage and all effects are negated). A Pok\u00e9mon with the same type as the move it uses will receive a 50% bonus to its damage, referred to as a \"Same-Type Attack Bonus\" (STAB). Moves are further defined as \"physical\" or \"special\"; before the ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' games, moves' status of being either physical or special depended on the type, rather than on the individual move. There are also \"status\" moves, which deal no damage and often inflict status changes on the defending or attacking Pok\u00e9mon. Damage-inflicting moves remove a certain number of [[Health (gaming)|Health Points]] from the target Pok\u00e9mon based on the types of the move and its target, and on the statistics of the two Pok\u00e9mon. The damage can also be affected by [[#Items|items]] held by either Pok\u00e9mon or by their [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]].\n\nEach move has a specific {{nihongo4|accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d|Meich\u016b}}, which determines the chance of hitting the target Pok\u00e9mon assuming no changes are made to user's [[#Stats|accuracy]] or the target's evasiveness. Very powerful moves often have below-average accuracy. Moves with standard 100% accuracy ratings are susceptible to changes in accuracy and evasiveness, but some moves bypass both and always land.\n\nThe PP (Power Points) of a move indicate how many times a Pok\u00e9mon may use that move. As with accuracy, a powerful move is often offset by having a low number of PP. Once a Pok\u00e9mon uses up all the PP for a certain move, it can no longer use that move. If a Pok\u00e9mon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to a move called Struggle, which damages the user as well as the target. Depleted PP can be restored by using certain items or by visiting a Pok\u00e9mon Center.\n\nMany moves have effects beyond inflicting damage. A common secondary effect is a chance to induce a certain {{nihongo4|[[status effect]]|\u72b6\u614b\u7570\u5e38|j\u014dtai ij\u014d}} on the target: {{nihongo4|paralysis|\u307e\u3072|Mahi}}, {{nihongo4|burn|\u3084\u3051\u3069|Yakedo}}, {{nihongo4|freeze|\u3053\u304a\u308a|K\u014dri}}, {{nihongo4|poison|\u3069\u304f|Doku}}, or {{nihongo4|sleep|\u306d\u3080\u308a|Nemuri}}; each negatively affects how the afflicted Pok\u00e9mon performs in battle. Some moves have negative side-effects for the user, such as forcing the player to wait a turn before or after use or causing recoil damage. A few moves, such as Splash, does nothing whatsoever except when used as a Z-Move.\n\n=== Z-Moves ===\nOnce per battle, if a Pok\u00e9mon holds a Z-Crystal, a powerful object you get from completing island trials, it can use an upgraded version of one of its moves, called a Z-Move. Z-Moves based on attacking moves tend to have much higher power than normal; those based on status moves usually incur a benefit on the user before executing the move.\n\n=== Moves outside of battles ===\nCertain moves can also be used in the overworld to bypass obstacles, quickly travel between locations, escape dungeons, or heal Pok\u00e9mon. Usually, Pok\u00e9mon will learn these moves with the use of the [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|HM]] items and will be able to use them in the aforementioned ways after certain Badges are obtained.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon abilities ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Abilities|\u7279\u6027|Tokusei}} are special attributes which were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. Specific species of Pok\u00e9mon have one to three possible Abilities, with individual Pok\u00e9mon exhibiting one Ability each. Unlike the moves a Pok\u00e9mon knows, its Ability cannot normally change (except sometimes during evolution, and by using the Ability Capsule, which was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']]).\n\nMost Pok\u00e9mon use their Abilities in battle. Abilities can strengthen a Pok\u00e9mon's statistics or weaken a foe, inflict [[status effect]]s such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform other effects. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as Water Absorb - when a Pokemon with this Ability gets hit by a Water-type attack, it absorbs the attack upon contact, recovering HP in the process, rather than losing HP as normal. Not all Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pok\u00e9mon. For example, [[Slaking (Pok\u00e9mon)|Slaking]], which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only lets it attack every other turn.\n\nSome Abilities have effects outside of Pok\u00e9mon battles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon with the Pickup Ability will sometimes retrieve items off the ground. A Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability Intimidate, mentioned above, will cause the player to encounter lower-level wild Pok\u00e9mon less often.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;277</ref>\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'' introduced Hidden Abilities, which initially could only be found on Pok\u00e9mon acquired from the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link, either through the Pok\u00e9mon Dream World feature or through promotional releases. There are also rare instances of Hidden Abilities available in the main game, either as a special encounter or as a Trade with an NPC. ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' introduced the game mechanic of {{nihongo4|Hidden Grottoes|\u96a0\u3057\u7a74|Kakushi Ana}}, areas where the player has a chance to find a Pok\u00e9mon that has its Hidden Ability. Subsequent games introduced more means of obtaining Pok\u00e9mon with Hidden Abilities; for instance, Pok\u00e9mon encountered in Horde Battles have a small chance of having their Hidden Ability.\n\n== Stats ==\nAll Pok\u00e9mon have six {{nihongo4|[[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]|\u80fd\u529b|N\u014dryoku|\"Attribute\"}} which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-natures-tips-tricks-guide-synchronise-everstone/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Natures: How Personality Changes Stats And Abilities|date=12 April 2019|website=TheGamer|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.\n* '''HP''' (short for Health Points): <!-- the official Pok\u00e9mon Emerald website says it's \"Health Points\" in Tucker's trivia; can we add this as a citation? --> A Pok\u00e9mon faints when its HP reaches zero, and it cannot be used in battle again until it is revived at a Pok\u00e9mon Center, or with a special item. However, they can still use moves in the field.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Attack'''|\u3053\u3046\u3052\u304d|K\u014dgeki}}: Determines the strength of a Pok\u00e9mon's physical [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attacks]].\n* {{nihongo4|'''Defense'''|\u307c\u3046\u304e\u3087|B\u014dgyo}}: Determines the Pok\u00e9mon's resistance against physical attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Special Attack'''|\u3068\u304f\u3053\u3046|Tokuk\u014d}}: Determines the power of a Pok\u00e9mon's special attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Special Defense'''|\u3068\u304f\u307c\u3046|Tokub\u014d}}: Determines the Pok\u00e9mon's resilience to special attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Speed'''|\u3059\u3070\u3084\u3055|Subayasa}}: After battle commands are entered, the Speed statistics of the participating Pok\u00e9mon are compared. With some exceptions, Pok\u00e9mon with higher Speed make their moves before those with lower Speed.\n\nThere are also two other statistics, {{nihongo4|Accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d\u7387|Meich\u016britsu}} and {{nihongo4|Evasiveness|\u56de\u907f\u7387|Kaihiritsu}}, which are not affected when Pok\u00e9mon level up. No Pok\u00e9mon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pok\u00e9mon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called \"Evade\" in the first generation and \"Evasion\" in the second.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'', both the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were a single stat, named the \"Special\" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/pokemon-red-blue-things-wrong/|title=25 Things Wrong With Pok\u00e9mon Red And Blue Everyone Chooses To Ignore|date=29 March 2019|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pok\u00e9mon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pok\u00e9mon's base stat values, effort values, Pok\u00e9mon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each Pok\u00e9mon with its unique stats.\n\n=== Base stat values ===\nThe Base stat values determine the natural statistical strengths of the various Pok\u00e9mon species. Every species is assigned a number in each of the six stats; the higher the number, the higher the stat can potentially be. While these values may greatly vary between species, they are the same for each member of that species. It is the difference among species which explains why all [[List of generation I Pok\u00e9mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] will have a higher Speed than any [[Snorlax]] of the same level; however, it is the combination of other factors that causes some Snorlax to be faster than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/smog/issue6/base_stats|title=Base Stat Ratings - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Adding up all the base stat values for a certain species generates the base stat total, which players use to determine approximately how strong that species is.\n\n=== Effort values ===\n{{nihongo4|Effort values|\u52aa\u529b\u5024|doryokuchi|EVs}} are hidden values that affect the strengths of a Pok\u00e9mon in particular statistical areas. Differing effort value levels between two Pok\u00e9mon can create a significant difference in the two Pok\u00e9mon's statistical strengths. When a Pok\u00e9mon battles and defeats an opponent, they gain experience points and also receive a number and type of EVs according to the defeated Pok\u00e9mon's species. Every defeated Pok\u00e9mon gives at least one EV to each of the Pok\u00e9mon that fought it. Certain factors, like holding the Macho Brace item, can increase the rate at which EVs are gained in battle. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], a condition known as {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9rus|\u30dd\u30b1\u30eb\u30b9|Pokerusu}} was introduced which doubles the rate at which EVs are obtained, and will be contagious for a certain number of days, allowing it to spread to other Pok\u00e9mon. Also, consuming certain items can increase a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs, and certain Berries decrease EVs while increasing a Pok\u00e9mon's friendship value. There is a limit on the number of EVs Pok\u00e9mon can have, which prevents stats from increasing indefinitely. The total limit allows for maximum Effort Values in two stats simultaneously.\n\nIn the first- and second-generation games, a similar system usually referred to as Stat Experience or Stat Exp. was used. As with Effort Values, there is a limit to how much Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have in each stat; however, unlike Effort Values, there is no limit to the total Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have across all stats, meaning that a Pok\u00e9mon can have maximum Stat Exp. in every stat. Also of note is that, for Pok\u00e9mon from the first and second generation to be forward and backward compatible for trading, Stat Exp. was not tracked separately for Special Attack and Special Defense in the second generation games. Instead, the Special Stat Exp. value was used to calculate both Special Attack and Special Defense.\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], a minigame known as {{nihongo4|Super Training|\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec|Supatore}} is introduced that allows players to more accurately manage the effort values. The player can do this by playing a [[Association football|soccer]]-like minigame, which also rewards the player with training bags to continue the training passively. The Pok\u00e9mon's effort values can also be viewed in the Super Training interface, which includes an \"Effort-o-Meter\" to allow the player to see the maximum capability of increasing the Pok\u00e9mon's effort values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/super_training/ |title=Super Training |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/05.html |title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u3092\u7279\u8a13\u3060\uff01 \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u306e\u80b2\u3066\u65b9\u3001\u300c\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec\u300d\uff01\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], a graph of a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs along with its base stats can be seen by pressing the Y button while viewing the summary of a Pok\u00e9mon. A sparkling stat shows that the Pok\u00e9mon had obtained the maximum number of EVs for the stat. Pok\u00e9mon can gain EVs passively through a feature called \"Pok\u00e9 Pelago\".\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Natures ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Natures|\u6027\u683c|Seikaku}} were first introduced in ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a Nature, randomly assigned when it is generated, which cannot be changed. A Pok\u00e9mon's Nature affects the rate at which some of its stats increase: out of the twenty-five possible Natures, twenty will increase one stat's growth rate but decrease another's. The other five modify the same stat in both increases and decreases, and thus the Pok\u00e9mon's overall growth is unaffected.<ref name=\"smogon.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/ingame/guides/breeding_guide_part1|title=The Breeding Guide Part I - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Natures also determine which flavor of [[#Pok\u00e9mon Contests|Pok\u00e9blocks or Poffins]] that Pok\u00e9mon likes and dislikes.\n\n=== Individual values ===\n{{nihongo4|Individual values|\u500b\u4f53\u5024|kotaichi}} or IVs are a hidden value for each statistic which determine a Pok\u00e9mon's maximum potential. These values are randomly generated along with each Pok\u00e9mon when it is encountered or bred, and set in stone for the rest of the game. These hidden values are why even Pok\u00e9mon that seem identical and have been raised the same way may have different stats. IVs range from 0 to 31,<ref name=\"smogon.com\"/> and their Generations I and II predecessors, \"determinant values\", ranged from 0 to 15.\n\n== Items ==\nItems can be found in the world, given to the player by NPCs, or bought at shops for in-game currency.\n\n=== Recovery items ===\nMany items received in the game are used to heal Pok\u00e9mon during and outside of battles. A range of items cure various status conditions, such as Antidotes for poisoning and Awakenings for sleep. Revives restore a Pok\u00e9mon back to health after it has lost all of its HP. Ethers and Elixirs restore the PP of a Pok\u00e9mon's moves to varying degrees.\n\n=== Technical and Hidden Machines ===\n{{nihongo4|Technical Machines|\u308f\u3056\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Waza Mashin}} and {{nihongo4|Hidden Machines|\u3072\u3067\u3093\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Hiden Mashin}}, commonly abbreviated as TMs and HMs, can be used to teach moves to Pok\u00e9mon, including some moves that they would otherwise not learn by increasing in level. TMs are commonly found in the field, in shops, and as rewards for defeating a Gym Leader. HMs are often vital to game progression as they have important effects outside of battle, allowing the player to traverse certain obstacles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon who learn the HM move Surf can transport the protagonist over water, which is necessary to reach island locations. When a Pok\u00e9mon learns an HM move, the move cannot be deleted or replaced unless the player uses the services of an NPC known as the Move Deleter.  \n\n=== Key items ===\nKey items are rarer than regular items and are usually given to the player rather than found. These include [[fishing rod]]s which are used to find water-dwelling Pok\u00e9mon, a bicycle which allows the protagonist to move around faster, a dowsing machine, and keys which open locked doors leading to important areas. These items cannot be thrown away, sold, or given to a Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Held items ===\nStarting with [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], each Pok\u00e9mon is able to hold a single item. Items carried by Pok\u00e9mon can have a range of effects. Some, like Berries, are consumed after one use and boost HP or stats. Others persistently boost move power, defense, Speed, and more. Just like moves, some items hinder the user to compensate their power; for instance, the Life Orb boosts the damage of the holder's attacks, but hurts it after each successful attack. Others items solely harm the user except in rare situations, such as the Toxic Orb, which badly poisons it. [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|Pok\u00e9mon ''X'' and ''Y'']] introduced Mega Stones used to [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] members of the stone's species, and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced Z-Crystals, which give the holder access to Z-Moves. Items like the Razor Claw and Razor Fang [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] certain Pok\u00e9mon when held while a condition is met. Most items, including [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s and [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Items|Potions]], can be held but have no effect when given to a Pok\u00e9mon. Items can be moved between, removed from, and neutralized on Pok\u00e9mon through moves like Trick, Knock Off, and Embargo, or consumed to damage the opponent through the attacks Fling and Natural Gift.  \n\n== Catching Pok\u00e9mon ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9ball.png|thumb|left|150px|The standard Pok\u00e9 Ball is a well-known icon of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' franchise.]]\nBecause each player begins the game with only one starter Pok\u00e9mon, catching is one of the most fundamental aspects of Pok\u00e9mon, and the primary method of recruiting new Pok\u00e9mon to the player's party.\n\nIn a battle against a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to catch it by using one of many different types of [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s. The odds of success vary, but are increased if the target Pok\u00e9mon's HP is low, if the target is affected by a status-altering effect like sleep or paralysis, and if a stronger or specially-suited Pok\u00e9 Ball is used.\n\nIf the catch is successful, the caught Pok\u00e9mon's data is added to the [[#Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9dex]], the player may give the Pok\u00e9mon a nickname, and the Pok\u00e9mon is added to the player's party. However, if the player's party is filled to its maximum of six Pok\u00e9mon, the caught Pok\u00e9mon is instead sent to a storage box accessible at Pok\u00e9mon Centers. In the first- and second-generation games, if the current PC box is full, the player will be unable to catch any new Pok\u00e9mon until he or she accesses a PC and switches to a different box. In more recent games, new Pok\u00e9mon are automatically transferred to the next available box.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9 Ball ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9 Ball'''|\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Monsut\u0101b\u014dru|\"Monster Ball\"}} is a spherical device used by Pok\u00e9mon Trainers to catch wild Pok\u00e9mon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pok\u00e9mon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pok\u00e9mon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pok\u00e9mon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily caught. [[Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] are much more capable of resisting being caught, and will often require many Pok\u00e9 Balls or more powerful Pok\u00e9 Balls to catch them. If the player attempts to catch a non-player character's Pok\u00e9mon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft. Ultra beasts require a different pokeball altogether.\n\nAs depicted in the anime and manga series, the Pok\u00e9 Ball, when not in use, is the size of a [[golf ball]] and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a [[baseball]]. The Pok\u00e9mon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pok\u00e9mon, a beam of red light converts the Pok\u00e9mon into energy to reclaim it. Pok\u00e9 Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pok\u00e9mon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hilliard |first1=Kyle |last2=Masuda |first2=Junichi |date=December 2012 |title=Pok\u00e9mon's Burning Questions |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=236 |pages=112}}</ref> The Pok\u00e9mon [[Voltorb]], [[Electrode (Pok\u00e9mon)|Electrode]], [[Foongus]], and [[Amoonguss]] are often mistaken for Pok\u00e9 Balls, due to their shape and color schemes which highly resemble Pok\u00e9 Balls.\n\nVarious types of Pok\u00e9 Balls exist. Introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] are the Pok\u00e9 Ball, {{nihongo4|Great Ball|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|S\u016bp\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Super Ball\"}}, {{nihongo4|Ultra Ball|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Haip\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Hyper Ball\"}}, and {{nihongo4|Master Ball|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Masut\u0101 B\u014dru}}. The Master Ball always succeeds against any Pok\u00e9mon that can be caught, and of which typically only one is available in the game. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], there are fruits called '''Apricorns''', which, when given to Kurt in Azalea Town, make one of seven special types of Pok\u00e9 Balls, depending on the Apricorn's color. The seven kinds of Pok\u00e9 Balls Kurt can make (and the seven color Apricorns they are made out of) are Level (Red), Moon (Yellow), Lure (Blue), Friend (Green), Love (Pink), Fast (White), and Heavy (Black). Beginning in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', and ''Emerald'']], other specialized balls appear, including the Timer Ball, which becomes more effective as the number of turns in the current battle rises, and the Net Ball, which has a better chance of catching Water and Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, among others. In addition, in several games there exists an area called the Safari Zone in which only Safari Balls can be used; these cannot be obtained or used elsewhere in the game. [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced the Beast Ball, which is designed for capturing Ultra Beasts and is much more effective at capturing them than standard Pok\u00e9 Balls. There is also a special kind of Pok\u00e9 Ball known as the Cherish Ball, which can only be obtained through special distribution events.\n\nIn the [[Nintendo GameCube]] RPGs, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', the player is able to catch non-player characters' Pok\u00e9mon through the use of the Snag Machine, which turns Pok\u00e9 Balls into Snag Balls. Snag Balls are capable of catching any Pok\u00e9mon, and are developed by the antagonists to steal Pok\u00e9mon where they are not common in the wild. Snag Balls can also be used by the player to catch Shadow Pok\u00e9mon who have been tainted by the antagonist group and that the player is required to purify for game completion.\n\nPok\u00e9 Balls have appeared in every installment of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, releasing a Pok\u00e9mon to assist the player who grabbed it. ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' also introduces the Master Ball, which almost always releases a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, with a small chance of releasing Goldeen instead.\n\n[[UGO.com]] listed the Pok\u00e9 Ball eighteenth on their list of \"Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups\" citing how everybody runs to get it in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |title=Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups - UGO.com |publisher=[[UGO.com]] |author=Chris Littler |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019184843/http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |archivedate=2010-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n[[Category:Fictional items which are larger inside than outside]]\n\n=== Pok\u00e9dex ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9dex'''|[[:ja:\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451]]|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan|lit. \"Pok\u00e9mon Encyclopedia\"}} is an [[electronics|electronic]] device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pok\u00e9mon. The name ''Pok\u00e9dex'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Pok\u00e9mon ''and ''index''.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;28</ref> In the video games, whenever a Pok\u00e9mon is first caught, its height, weight, species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pok\u00e9dex. Each region has its own Pok\u00e9dex, which differ in appearance, species of Pok\u00e9mon catalogued, and functions such as the ability to sort the list of Pok\u00e9mon based on [[alphabetical order]] or display the Pok\u00e9mon's size compared to the player character. The \"National Pok\u00e9dex\" allows Pok\u00e9mon from all regions to be catalogued. The Nintendo 3DS application ''[[Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro]]'' features all of the Pok\u00e9mon with all of its forms and each one has its own animation.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon evolution ==\n[[File:Pokemon evolution.png|right|thumb|150px|A series of screenshots depicting an [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Abra evolving into a Kadabra]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald''.]]\n\n{{nihongo4|Evolution|\u9032\u5316|shinka}} is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in [[#Stats|stat]] values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Friendship|friendship]] level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\nThe player can choose to halt evolution at any time before the animation is finished by pressing the B button, unless the evolution was initiated by using an evolutionary stone on the Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon whose evolutions are canceled will attempt to evolve again after the condition for evolution is met again. Preventing evolution for a time can be useful, as many Pok\u00e9mon learn moves sooner in their unevolved form than in their evolved form.\n\nThe ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'' introduced the idea of numerical stages for referring to different points in a Pok\u00e9mon's evolution. This has translated into colloquial usage among fans of the games. All Pok\u00e9mon can be placed at one of four evolutionary stages (though no existing Pok\u00e9mon line includes more than three out of the four stages): Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 2 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|Baby Pok\u00e9mon]] which are acquired by breeding certain Basic or Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon and hatching their Eggs. A Pok\u00e9mon higher up on this evolutionary scale is sometimes called an evolved form of the previous stages; likewise, a Pok\u00e9mon lower down on the scale is said to be a pre-evolved form of later Pok\u00e9mon in the chain.\n\n=== Leveling up ===\nThis is the most common method of evolution across all Pok\u00e9mon generations, and involves Pok\u00e9mon acquiring experience points through battling other Pok\u00e9mon. \n\n=== Evolutionary stones ===\nEvolutionary stones are items which can be found throughout the games. Some Pok\u00e9mon can have particular evolutionary stones used on them, and doing so will cause the Pok\u00e9mon to evolve. Initially five evolutionary stones were introduced into the game: the Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon and Fire Stones. Later generations introduced more kinds, bringing the total to ten in Generation VII.\n\n=== Trading ===\nSome Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Machoke]] and [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Kadabra]], evolve when [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|traded]] between players. Additional evolutionary requirements can also exist; for instance, [[Seadra]] only evolves into [[Kingdra]] if it holds a Dragon Scale when traded, and [[Shelmet]] and [[Karrablast]] only evolve when traded for each other.\n\n=== Friendship ===\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|friendship|\u306a\u3064\u304d\u5ea6|Natsuki-do|lit. \"Degree of Emotional Attachment\"; nicknamed \"Happiness\" by players}} is an attribute that can rise or fall based upon several conditions and events. This aspect, introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'', determined Pikachu's stat growth and affected the outcome of certain NPC events. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] it is a means to evolve several Pok\u00e9mon.

The only Pok\u00e9mon capable of this transformation is [[Greninja]] with the Battle Bond Ability. Greninja will transform into Ash-Greninja if it knocks out a Pok\u00e9mon during battle, giving it an appearance similar to [[Ash Ketchum]], increased stats, and a stronger Water Shuriken. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, and Ultra Burst, Bond Phenomenon does not require an item to activate.\n\n=== Ultra Burst ===\nUltra Burst (\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8 ''Ultra Burst'') is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'']], exclusive to the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VII Pok\u00e9mon#Necrozma|Necrozma]]. Necrozma may undergo Ultra Burst if it is in its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form and holding the Ultranecrozium Z Z-Crystal, which will allow it to transform into Ultra Necrozma. Like Mega Evolution, Bond Phenomenon, and Primal Reversion, Ultra Burst increases Necrozma's stats and is a temporary transformation.\n\n=== Dynamax & Gigantamax ===\nDynamax (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Daimax'') and Gigantamax (\u30ad\u30e7\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Kyodaimax'') are mechanics introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']].

The Pok\u00e9mon can further increase its HP by 5% from using Dynamax Candy (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30a2\u30e1''Daimax Candy'') to increase it's Dynamax Level. Gigantamax is similar to Dynamax, but it changes the Pok\u00e9mon's form, similar to Mega Evolution. Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon use G-Max Moves, exclusive to the 26 Pok\u00e9mon capable of Gigantamaxing. Each Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon must have their respective move type in order to use their respective G-Max Move. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, Z-Moves, and Ultra Burst, Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing can only be used in Gym Stadiums, Max Raid Battles, and other areas except for wild or trainer battles. \n\n[[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zacian|Zacian]], [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zamazenta|Zamazenta]], and [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Eternatus|Eternatus]] are the only Pok\u00e9mon that cannot Dynamax.\n\n=== Eternamax ===\nEternamax (\u30e0\u30b2\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Mugendaimax'') is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], exclusive to the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Eternatus|Eternatus]].

Since the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of the games, the main series' game package features one Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, usually the Pok\u00e9mon most involved in the main storyline of that game. Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are often described as being exceptionally rare. In most cases, Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are exceptionally powerful, difficult to catch, and unable to [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]], and no known Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is capable of [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]]. Many Legendary Pok\u00e9mon also lack a gender. Certain Legendary Pok\u00e9mon colloquially termed \"roaming Pok\u00e9mon\" randomly move around the world map and flee from battle, making them even harder to obtain.\n\n=== Mythical Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u5e7b\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Maboroshi no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a separate group of Pok\u00e9mon. The term is commonly associated with Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, requiring an external mechanic to obtain them; however, some Mythical Pok\u00e9mon have been made obtainable in later releases, notably [[Deoxys]]. These Pok\u00e9mon are usually placed at the end of their respective games' Pok\u00e9dex and can only be obtained through distribution events set up by Nintendo. The first of these Mythical Pok\u00e9mon was [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]], who was programmed into the ''Red'' and ''Green'' games as a secret character by [[Shigeki Morimoto]] without any knowledge of the other members of the development team, and was not announced until several months after the games' release in a special promotion. Since then, the games have continued to feature Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, but the programming that allow the player to catch them within the games can be activated by special items (or other Pok\u00e9mon) distributed by Nintendo. The first of these such items was the GS Ball in ''Crystal'', which was distributed to players in Japan through the mobile phone connector, allowing them to encounter [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]. Like Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Mythical Pok\u00e9mon are powerful and difficult to catch, are usually not part of an evolutionary line, and cannot breed (with the exception of [[Manaphy]]).\n\n=== Shiny Pok\u00e9mon ===\n[[File:ShinyZubatEncounter.JPG|thumb|left|The player finds a green Zubat in ''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version''.]]\n\n'''Shiny Pok\u00e9mon''' were first introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as a way to demonstrate the new color capabilities of the [[Game Boy Color]] system. These are Pok\u00e9mon which have a different coloration than normal; in earlier games, this was done by means of a [[palette swap]]. Encountering a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon is extremely rare; the probability under normal conditions is 1 in 8,192 (1 in 4,096 from the sixth generation onwards).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-mans-five-year-quest-to-find-a-shiny-pokemon-1603763304|title=One Man's Five-Year Quest To Find A Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> There are some major exceptions to this rule, such as a red [[Gyarados]] present in ''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'', ''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'', and three Pok\u00e9mon present in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], all of which are guaranteed to be Shiny.\n\nThere are various ways of increasing the chance of getting a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In second-generation games, breeding a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with a regular Pok\u00e9mon has a higher chance (1 in 64) of producing a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In ''Diamond'', ''Pearl'', ''Platinum'', ''X'', and ''Y'', the Pok\u00e9 Radar can be used to \"chain\" Pok\u00e9mon of the same species, improving the odds of a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with each link (up to 40 links, when the odds are 1 in 200). Since Generation IV, [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]] Pok\u00e9mon that originated in games of two different languages results in Eggs with a 1 in 1,638 (Generation IV games) or 1 in 1365 (Black and White onwards) chance to contain a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon; this method of increasing odds has been dubbed the \"Masuda method\" after developer [[Junichi Masuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-to-get-a-shiny-pokemon-in-pokemon-x-and-y |title=How to Get a Shiny Pokemon In Pokemon X and Y |last=Khaw |first=Cassandra |publisher=USgamer |access-date=2016-06-17}}</ref> Additionally, an item introduced in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called the Shiny Charm increases the probability of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. However, this item is only accessible long after completing the game, as the player must have completed the National Pok\u00e9dex (excluding Mythical Pok\u00e9mon). Beginning in ''Black'' and ''White'', certain Pok\u00e9mon in each game are 'Shiny-locked', meaning the player cannot obtain a Shiny variant of them in normal gameplay.\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|Pok\u00e9mon ''Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s SOS Battle mechanic created a new way to \"hunt\" for Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. If a wild Pok\u00e9mon calls allies to help and the ally is continually of the same species in a \"chain\", the chance that it calls a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon rises up to a base of 13 in 4096 after the 30th is called, as do the chances of Hidden Ability and perfect [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Stats|IVs]], though they are capped at four perfect IVs maximum. In their [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|sequels']] Ultra Warp Ride [[minigame]], by successfully traveling more [[light-year]]s through the wormhole and entering wormholes with more rings, the player can increase the chance of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the Ultra Space Wilds. Generation 7 also introduced an upgrade to the \"Masuda method\" referred to as \"Swap Breeding\"; the game is continually saved and soft-reset until a fast-hatching, dummy Pok\u00e9mon is hatched shiny within the first thirty attempts, and shininess is transplanted to the new Pok\u00e9mon hatched in the same position as the dummy was.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/6/8/17409856/shiny-pokemon-guide|title=How to build an army of competitive shiny Pok\u00e9mon|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', Shiny Pok\u00e9mon have slightly above-average stats, but this is because their Shininess is determined by their [[#Individual values|determinant values]] in those games. In the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Game Boy Advance era|third generation]] and onward, however, Shininess is determined by another value, and Shiny Pok\u00e9mon are not stronger than any other Pok\u00e9mon in battle. Most fans consider Shiny Pok\u00e9mon to be collectors' items because of their rarity.\n\nThe term \"Shiny\" was initially a term invented by the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' fan community due to the flash of stars that appear when such a Pok\u00e9mon enters a battle, implying a sheen property to the colors of the Pok\u00e9mon. The term \"Shiny Pok\u00e9mon\" was later officially acknowledged in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], but it has been used in the anime and in a few strategy guides before this. The term {{nihongo3|\"shining\"|\u5149\u308b|hikaru}} was also a widely used slang term in Japan; Ken Sugimori uses ''hikaru'' in the title of a piece of artwork featuring a Shiny Charizard. The alternate term {{nihongo4|\"Alt. Color\"|\u8272\u9055\u3044|Iro Chigai}} appears among the options the player can choose when filling out forms in the third generation of games.\n\nShiny Pok\u00e9mon have appeared in the anime, including the aforementioned red Gyarados and a Noctowl that protagonist Ash Ketchum catches. A pink Butterfree was also featured in an episode of the first season of the anime, but this alternate coloration is not what appears in the subsequent video games where the Shiny feature has been implemented.\n\n== Connectivity ==\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon trades ===\n[[File:Game Boy(RTSide).png|thumb|right|The game link port is located above the volume control on the original [[Game Boy]] handheld system.]]\n\nPlayers have the ability to trade their Pok\u00e9mon with one another by connecting two compatible games. Trading is an important aspect to the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games, being the crux upon which much of the franchise is based. This is because the slogan, and consequently the goal, \"Gotta catch 'em All,\" is logistically impossible without trading. Each game released in a [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Generations|generation]] has certain Pok\u00e9mon that are exclusive to that version. For example, in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' players can catch the Pok\u00e9mon [[Ekans]] and its evolved form, Arbok, while both are absent in the wild in both ''Pok\u00e9mon Blue'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''. Other Pok\u00e9mon are only available when offered up as a choice. The most obvious example is the choice between three [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] at the beginning of the game; the only way to get the other two is by trading. Some [[Non-player character|NPC]]s offer to trade Pok\u00e9mon with the player, allowing them to acquire Pok\u00e9mon otherwise unavailable without connecting to another game. For example, the only way to get a [[Jynx]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'' (other than trading with another game cartridge) is through an in-game trade. The other way that trading is made instrumental in gameplay is that some Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Haunter]] and [[Machoke]], only [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into their final forms when traded.\n\nTrading between games on the Game Boy and related systems is accomplished through a [[Game Link cable]] that attaches to ports found on all [[Game Boy line|Game Boy incarnations]]. The size of the ports varies between consoles, so several hybrid cables have been created that allow, for example, linking between the original [[Game Boy]] and the [[Game Boy Color]]. [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] include a special wireless dongle which plugs into the game link port for local wireless communication. On the [[Nintendo DS]], DS Wireless Communications is used instead.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;240\u2013245</ref> [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] also introduced the Global Trade Station/System (or GTS), a place where people all around the world may trade Pok\u00e9mon using the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. In the GTS hall, the player can input their own location and pinpoint the locations of other players they have interacted with. The Nintendo WFC records this data when they trade successfully with someone over the GTS or in their Pal Pad.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;254</ref> For the [[Nintendo 3DS family|Nintendo 3DS line]], two successors to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were implemented in each generation. In the Player Search System in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' & ''Y'']] and [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], the function is simply called Trade, while in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']] in the Festival Plaza, the function is called Link Trade. The second successor is called Wonder Trade; players choose a Pok\u00e9mon to trade and are randomly paired with another player around the world.\n\n== Mystery Gift ==\nMystery Gift, a means by which players can receive items from other people, was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] and has appeared in every handheld ''Pok\u00e9mon'' game since. To use Mystery Gift, the feature must first be activated in a specific way.\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', if two players line up the infrared ports on their [[Game Boy Color]] units and activate Mystery Gift from the intro menu, each will receive an item. This process also sends a record of each player's party Pok\u00e9mon to the other player's game for a daily event in Viridian City in which they can battle the other player's Pok\u00e9mon (controlled by the computer). Players can use Mystery Gift an unlimited number of times, but only once per day for each person. In addition, a player of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2]]'' with a ''Gold'', ''Silver'', or ''Crystal'' cartridge plugged into the [[Transfer Pak]] can use Mystery Gift with a girl in [[Pok\u00e9mon regions#Stadium regions|White City]]. A Mystery Gift can also be received by connecting with a [[Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu#Versions|Pocket Pikachu 2 GS]].\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], Mystery Gift is replaced with Mystery Event. This feature utilizes the now defunct [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] accessory. Using special [[Nintendo e-Reader#e-Reader cards|e-cards]], the player could obtain special items such as rare Berries or the Eon Ticket. In [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''LeafGreen'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|''Emerald'']], Mystery Gift is a means to obtain special items at Nintendo's promotional events through the use of the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]], which allow the player to catch otherwise unobtainable Pok\u00e9mon, such as [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] and [[Deoxys]].\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] expanded Mystery Gift to include a variety of transferring options. After enabling Mystery Gift, players may obtain items via wireless or [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], and may also transfer them to friends. Wireless connection also allows the player to transfer items from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution]]''. Currently, Mystery Gift via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Nintendo WFC]] has only been implemented in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]. However, this was changed when the shiny Pichu was distributed to all version games via WFC. Also, with the creation of the Pok\u00e9walker, in [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], came another way to Mystery Gift. By pressing the connect button on two Pok\u00e9walkers and pointing them at each other, both Pok\u00e9walkers will receive an item, which the player will receive upon connecting with his or her game. Beginning with [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], an option to receive Mystery Gifts by single-use serial code or password over [[Nintendo Network]] was added. Single-use codes are given out in participating retailers and via the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link and are usually region locked. Wireless and infrared events are no longer region locked, allowing any region console to receive events distributed by those methods.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Bank ===\n{{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u30af|Pok\u00e9mon Banku}} is an application which allows players to store up to 3,000 Pok\u00e9mon in an online [[cloud storage]] service. Players can deposit and withdraw Pok\u00e9mon from both physical and downloaded versions of compatible games, allowing players to exchange Pok\u00e9mon between the two versions without the need for a second system. Additionally, an application called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9 Transporter|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e0\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Poke M\u016bb\u0101|\"Pok\u00e9 Mover\"}} allows players to upload Pok\u00e9mon from ''Pok\u00e9mon Black'', ''White'', ''Black 2'', and ''White 2'' to the Pok\u00e9mon Bank, after which they can be imported into newer games. The service requires an annual subscription fee, and there are plans to continue to utilize it for future Pok\u00e9mon titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/strategy/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Bank|work=pokemonxy.com}}</ref>\n\nIntended for release on December 27, 2013, Pok\u00e9mon Bank was postponed due to unforeseen traffic levels on the [[Nintendo Network]] service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.es/Noticias/2013/diciembre/Banco-Pokemon-y-Poke-Trasladador-845138.html|title=Banco ''Pok\u00e9mon y'' Pok\u00e9 Trasladador|work=Nintendo of Europe GmbH}}</ref> Pok\u00e9mon Bank was fully released on the [[Nintendo eShop]] on January 22, 2014 in Japan, February 4, 2014 in Europe, and February 5, 2014 in North America.\n\nAs of an update released on January 24, 2017, [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] have also gained compatibility with Pok\u00e9mon Bank. The update allows players to send their Pok\u00e9mon from their core sixth generation games to ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', though when transferred, they cannot return to the older games. Additionally, the Pok\u00e9 Transporter was also updated to allow players to transfer Pok\u00e9mon caught in the [[Virtual Console]] editions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'' to ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon''. The update also added a new in-app National Pok\u00e9dex, presumably to make up for the lack of one in Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon Officially Announced|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/26/pokemon-sun-and-moon-officially-announced|website=IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/pokemon-bank-getting-national-pokedex-feature-with-sun-and-moon-support-20456791/|title=Pokemon Bank getting National Poked feature with Sun and Moon support - SlashGear|website=www.slashgear.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pokemon Bank Now Compatible With Sun and Moon|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/25/pokemon-bank-now-compatible-with-sun-and-moon|website=IGN|accessdate=January 25, 2017|date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn November 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'', it was announced that the games would support ''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'' later the same month. The update, which came three days later, also added compatibility with the Virtual Console versions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal|Crystal]]'' (which was not re-released until January 26, 2018) to the Pok\u00e9 Transporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/17/pokmon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-will-get-pokmon-bank-compatibility-update-late-november/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon Will Get Pok\u00e9mon Bank Compatibility Update In Late November|website=Siliconera|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Home ===\nOn May 28, 2019, Pok\u00e9mon Home was revealed as the successor application to Pok\u00e9mon Bank. Scheduled for release in February 2020, the app will be available on [[Nintendo Switch]] and smartphone devices, and will have connectivity with Pok\u00e9mon Bank, [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Phillip|title=POK\u00c9MON HOME IS NEW POK\u00c9MON BANK THAT CONNECTS 'SWORD AND SHIELD, 'POK\u00c9MON GO' AND MORE|url=https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-home-bank-sword-shield-go-1437721}}</ref> Players can get a free version that can store up to 30 Pokemon, or they can buy the premium pass which will let them store up to 6,000, twice as much as ''Pokemon Bank''.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon breeding ==\nPok\u00e9mon breeding was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]. Pok\u00e9mon can be bred in-game at a {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Day Care|\u80b2\u3066\u5c4b|Sodateya}}. These are businesses generally run by an elderly person or couple, which raise Trainers' Pok\u00e9mon for a fee. If two compatible Pok\u00e9mon are left there, they will eventually produce a Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Egg|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4|tamago}}, which the Trainer can pick up for free. After being carried by the Trainer for some distance, the Egg will hatch into a young Pok\u00e9mon, usually of the lowest stage in its mother's [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolutionary line]].\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon have pre-evolutions that are usually only obtainable by hatching them from Eggs. Known as \"baby Pok\u00e9mon\", these Pok\u00e9mon are unable to breed but have evolutions that can breed baby Pok\u00e9mon. For most baby Pok\u00e9mon introduced after ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', the parent can only produce these Pok\u00e9mon when holding a certain item.<ref name=\"PBreeding\">Marcus, p.&nbsp;13</ref>\n\n=== Compatibility ===\nCompatibility is usually restricted to one male and one female. In addition, Pok\u00e9mon species are assigned to {{nihongo4|Egg Groups|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7|Tamago Gur\u016bpu}}, which determines their breeding compatibility with other species. Pok\u00e9mon may belong to up to two Egg Groups; in order to breed, they must share at least one Egg Group. Nearly all Pok\u00e9mon species, even those that are all-male or genderless, are able to breed with the shapeshifting Pok\u00e9mon [[Ditto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ditto]]. The Egg produced will yield a hatchling from the non-Ditto Pok\u00e9mon's evolutionary line. Two Ditto cannot breed to produce another Ditto.\n\nA select group of species cannot breed at all, which includes all Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, all Ultra Beasts, most Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Nidorina and Nidoqueen (but not Nidoran\u2640), Unown, and all \"baby\" Pok\u00e9mon. This is called the \"Undiscovered\" Egg Group. Although some Legendary Pok\u00e9mon have genders, they still cannot breed. An unusual circumstance involves the relation of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Manaphy and Phione; both can breed with Ditto to create an Egg which hatches into Phione, yet Phione does not evolve into Manaphy. Manaphy itself is obtained from an Egg from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Ranger]]'' games, but it will never breed to produce another Manaphy Egg.\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nPok\u00e9mon hatched from Eggs can {{nihongo4|inherit|\u907a\u4f1d|iden}} stats from their parents. Three of the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Individual values|individual values]] are inherited from one or the other of its parents, and the other three IVs are generated randomly.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\">Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;18.</ref>\n\nMoves can also be inherited through breeding. Moves that a newly hatched Pok\u00e9mon begins with are divided into three categories: learned moves, inherited moves, and hereditary moves or \"Egg Moves\". Learned moves are moves that the Pok\u00e9mon would have naturally at its starting level; inherited moves are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would be able to learn at later levels or through TMs; and {{nihongo4|Egg Moves|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u308f\u3056|Tamago Waza}}, inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y''), are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would not be able to learn normally. The Pok\u00e9mon can learn the move on this occasion as it receives the move from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pok\u00e9mon's move slots are filled with learned moves. However, if there are any inherited moves or Egg Moves available for the Pok\u00e9mon to learn, they replace the learned moves.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\" /><ref>Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;19.</ref>\n\n== Battle facilities ==\n{{redirect|Battle Frontier|the season of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]]|List of Pok\u00e9mon: Battle Frontier episodes}}\nIn addition to the Pok\u00e9mon Gyms and other battles to advance the plot, side games and post-game areas have been introduced in subsequent editions of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that extend the gameplay.\n\nFirst introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'', the {{nihongo4|Battle Tower|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc|Batoru Taw\u0101}} is a game feature accessible outside of the main storyline where the player faces several Trainers in succession with a limited set of their Pok\u00e9mon and receive prizes in the form of otherwise rare items. The Japanese version of ''Crystal'' which had a [[mobile phone]] adapter allowed for players to challenge other players to Battle Tower fights. The next Battle Towers appear in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], which is similar to the ''Crystal'' Battle Tower, and in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], which has a boss character and a point system similar to the Battle Frontiers.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Frontier|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2|Batoru Furontia}} was introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', replacing the Battle Tower as found in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games. In addition to having its own Battle Tower with the same rules as the previous ones, the Battle Frontier adds several other game mechanics that make [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battles]] unique in the end game. Examples include the Battle Palace's prohibition on choosing what moves the Pok\u00e9mon uses and the Battle Factory's random rental Pok\u00e9mon. Instead of prizes, the player is awarded Battle Points (BP) which can be traded for rare items or TMs. The ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' Battle Tower uses this same system, and it is replaced by a Battle Frontier in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]''. The [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games also have a Battle Frontier, identical to that of the ''Platinum'' version, where the Battle Tower was found in ''Crystal''. After a series of battles in each venue, players encounter {{nihongo4|[[Frontier Brains]]|\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3|Furontia Bur\u0113n}} who are challenged in the same fashion as all other battles, and the player will either earn a {{nihongo4|Symbol|\u30b7\u30f3\u30dc\u30eb|Shinboru|''Emerald''}} or a {{nihongo4|Commemorative Print|\u304d\u306d\u3093\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8|Kinen Purinto|''Platinum'', ''HeartGold'', ''SoulSilver''}} for winning. The Frontier Brains can be challenged a second time to more advanced versions of the Symbols or Prints (advancing from Silver to Gold). The Frontier Brains have very powerful Pok\u00e9mon, often including [[#Legendary Pok\u00e9mon|Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]], making a victory even more difficult than in the main storyline.\n\n''Emerald'' also features {{nihongo4|Battle Tents|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8|Batoru Tento}}, which allow the player to encounter some of the unique battle mechanics of three of the Battle Frontier venues. Rather than Battle Points, the player is awarded with an item that is rare or expensive.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Subway|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4|Batoru Sabuwei}} is unique to the [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']] games and serves as the games' Battle Tower, taking on the form of a [[Rapid transit|subway]] to match the games' [[New York City]]-styled setting. In the same vein as the Battle Tower in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' and the various Battle Frontiers, players earn BP and after a certain number of battles they challenge one or both of the two Subway Bosses ({{nihongo4|Subway Masters|\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Sabuwei Masut\u0101}} in Japan), depending on what type of battles (Single, Double, or Multi) the player was competing in.\n\nThe Battle Subway returns in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], but it is joined by two new sets of areas. The first one introduced in the games is the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon W\u0101rudo T\u014dnamento}}, wherein the player participates in a tournament-style setting with various NPC Trainers, set to a particular theme of a level limit, using randomly assigned teams, or using teams downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, to earn BP. The more advanced side of the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament is a tournament-style setting in battling the Gym Leaders and Pok\u00e9mon League Champions from all over the Pok\u00e9mon World, enabling players to challenge characters such as Brock and Misty from ''Red'' and ''Blue'', Volkner from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Lance from ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', or Steven from ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Also introduced in the games are the {{nihongo4|Black Tower|\u9ed2\u306e\u6469\u5929\u697c|Kuro no Matenr\u014d}} in ''Black 2''{{'}}s Black City and the {{nihongo4|White Treehollow|\u767d\u306e\u6a39\u6d1e|Shiro no Jud\u014d}} in ''White 2''{{'}}s White Forest. In these facilities, the player must battle a series of Trainers without using items, and only relying on Doctor or Nurse Trainers to restore their team's health. At the end, the player challenges the leader and later is awarded a rare Pok\u00e9mon for succeeding.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Maison|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9|Batoru Hausu|\"Battle House\"}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']], and can only be accessed after the player completes the main story. Similar to the Battle Frontier and the Battle Subway, there are different types of battling methods to choose from: single, double, triple, rotation, and multi battles. Then the player is drawn to a tournament where he/she is challenged to numerous battles with random Trainers. After winning a battle the player receives one BP (battle point) which can later be used to by items, vitamins, and TMs. After winning 21 battles the player must battle the strongest Trainer or referred to as the Battle Chatelaine. It depends on what battle style you choose. If the player beats 50 Trainers, they have the chance to battle one of the Battle Chatelaines again. Only this time do they use legendary Pok\u00e9mon (e.g. Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno). Another similar feature is the {{nihongo4|Battle Chateau|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30c8\u30fc|Batoru Shat\u014d}}, where the player advances through a ranking system based on the [[French nobility]] system after battling increasingly difficult Trainers, including being able to battle the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Champion in the same system.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'', the Battle Maison returns, but the Battle Frontier, which was featured in the original ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games, is hinted to be in production. The Battle Maison is very similar to the one in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'', but TMs (Technical Machines) cannot be bought; they are replaced by other items.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Royal|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Battle Royal}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], which involves four Trainers all battling each other at the same time. After becoming Champion, the player is given access to the {{nihongo4|Battle Tree|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc|Battle Tree}} on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is similar to the Battle Maison, Battle Subway, and Battle Towers from the previous generations. On the 20th battle of normal challenges and 50th battle of Super challenges, a powerful Trainer known as a Battle Legend will be challenged.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon Competitions ==\nIn addition to battling, several Pok\u00e9mon competitions have been introduced throughout the series to provide an alternate set of mini-games.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Contests ===\n{{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Contests|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon Kontesuto}} are competitions of skill among Pok\u00e9mon Trainers and their Pok\u00e9mon partners. Pok\u00e9mon Contests are different from [[Pok\u00e9mon battle]]s, testing talent rather than power. They were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and later appeared in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Omega Ruby'', and ''Alpha Sapphire'']].\n\nThere are five categories that a Pok\u00e9mon can be entered into: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough, and Smart. In addition, there are four ranks of contests: Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master Rank. To enter, a Trainer must go to the contest hall that holds contests of the appropriate rank, and in ranks higher than Normal, the participating Pok\u00e9mon must have won the contest of the selected category in the previous rank. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Contests are renamed Super Contests, and the four ranks are named Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;227</ref>\n\nIn the first round (called \"Visual Competition\" in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'') the Pok\u00e9mon is shown to the audience, who then vote on their favorite. Pok\u00e9mon will gain more points here if they have good condition in the selected category, which can be increased by using Pok\u00e9blocks. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Pok\u00e9blocks are replaced by Poffins, and the player can also use the stylus to dress up their Pok\u00e9mon in certain {{nihongo4|Accessories|\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc|Akusesar\u012b}} to fit the theme of the contest.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;229\u2013233</ref>\n\nThe second round, called \"Dance Competition\", was introduced in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. The participating Pok\u00e9mon join in a dance routine. The leading Pok\u00e9mon gets rated based on following the rhythm, and the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon have to mimic the leader's steps. All four participants take turns to be the leader.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;234</ref>\n\nThe final round (\"Acting Competition\") comprises a few rounds, and the Pok\u00e9mon are ordered in sequence based on their performance in the previous round. Each round, the player chooses one Pok\u00e9mon move to perform before the judge, and in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' players also choose which of three judges to appeal to. Each move has a category, appeal value, and effect. Using a good combination will gain the Pok\u00e9mon more appeal points, but using the same move twice consecutively will be less effective. Moves can have many effects, such as \"jamming\" previous Pok\u00e9mon to reduce their appeal, or randomizing the order of appeals in the next round.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;235\u2013236</ref> After appeals are concluded, the results are shown, and the Pok\u00e9mon with the most total points wins a ribbon.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;237</ref>\n\n==== Pok\u00e9blocks and Poffins ====\nPok\u00e9blocks ({{nihongo4|Polock|\u30dd\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Porokku}}), introduced in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', are [[candy]]-like treats used to increase the contest condition and Loyalty of Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9blocks are created from Berries in the \"Berry Blender\" minigame, which can be played by two to four human or computer-controlled players. The types of berries blended by all participants affect the category and effectiveness of the resulting Pok\u00e9block. Pok\u00e9blocks are also used in the games' Safari Zone to attract wild Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n{{nihongo4|Poffins|\u30dd\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3|Pofin}}, a type of baked goods, were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] as replacements for Pok\u00e9blocks. Poffins are made by adding a Berry to some batter in a pot, and stirring it with a stylus using the [[Nintendo DS]]'s touch screen. Poffins can be mixed only with human partners and can be done solo or with two to four players wirelessly.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9athlon ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], the contest minigame is replaced with an athletic competition called the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9athlon|\u30dd\u30b1\u30b9\u30ed\u30f3|Pokesuron}}. The competitions range from [[track and field]] events such as [[hurdling]] or a [[relay race]] to a [[snowball fight]] and a game resembling [[pachinko]].\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon's stats may be increased by consuming {{nihongo4|\"Aprijuice\"|\u30dc\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af|Bon Dorinku|\"Bon Drink\"}} made from fruits known as Apricorns that the player can find throughout the world. By putting a number of Apricorns in a [[blender]] and making the player character run a certain number of steps, the Apricorns are mixed into a [[milkshake]]-like blend. The process can be repeated multiple times, each time adding more Apricorns to the mixture and running to blend them. The number of times this is done, along with the variety of Apricorns used, affects the type and effectiveness of the resulting Aprijuice. Aprijuice will increase one of five additional statistics that only exist for the Pok\u00e9athlon which consist of Speed, Power, Skill, Jump, and Stamina.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Musicals ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], the contest minigame is replaced by the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Musicals|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb|Pok\u00e9mon My\u016bjikaru}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Rather than grooming Pok\u00e9mon with Pok\u00e9blocks, Poffins, or Aprijuice, the player's Pok\u00e9mon is only dressed in Accessories which can be waved around on stage when the Pok\u00e9mon dances to various pieces of music; the player does not control the Pok\u00e9mon during this time, other than Appealing with special props. If the audience likes the performance, they give more props to the player in person post-performance. The player can, in fact, control the camera angle during the performance.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9star Studios ===\nAnother minigame is added in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9star Studios|\u30dd\u30b1\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9|Pokeuddo|\"Pok\u00e9wood\"}}. The player joins the cast of a movie and participates in a mock battle with a [[chroma key]] opponent, while picking line options that match the script of the film and completing an objective within a particular set of turns. Depending on how well the player performs according to the script, they will receive items from the film premiere's audience and unlock more movies to participate in.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters|List of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' characters]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Version: the official strategy guide from Nintendo Power|date=2006-08-24|publisher=Nintendo Power|author=Nintendo Power}}\n* {{cite book|title=Pok\u00e9mon Emerald: Official Strategy Guide|date=2006-08-24|publisher=Prima Games|author=Buchanan, B}}\n* {{cite book|title=Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version [and] Pok\u00e9mon Ruby Version|publisher=Prima Games|year=2003|isbn=0-7615-4256-6|author=Hollinger, Elizabeth M.|url=https://archive.org/details/pokemonrubyversi00holl}}\n* {{cite book|title=''Pok\u00e9mon Crystal'' Version|publisher=Prima Games|year=2001|isbn=0-7615-3666-3|author=Hollinger, Elizabeth M.}}\n* The instruction booklet of ''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond Version''.
