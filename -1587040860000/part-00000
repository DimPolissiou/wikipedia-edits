In contrast to the previous Tintin books, Herg\u00e9 deliberately broke the adventure formula he had created: it is the only book in the series where the characters remain at [[Marlinspike Hall]], [[Captain Haddock]]'s family estate, and neither travel abroad nor confront dangerous criminals. The plot concerns the visit of the opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]] and the subsequent theft of her emerald.\n\nAlthough ''The Castafiore Emerald'' received critical acclaim for its humourous depiction of its characters following a trail of [[red herrings]], it failed to match the commercial success of previous volumes due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by [[Casterman]] shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]'', while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]]. The story was adapted for both the 1991 [[Ellipse Programm\u00e9|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and the 1992-3 [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] dramatisation of the ''Adventures''.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Captain Haddock]] are walking through the countryside of [[List of The Adventures of Tintin locations#Alphabetical list|Marlinshire]] when they come across a [[Romani people|Romani]] community camped in a [[garbage dump]], and reunite a lost little girl named Miarka with her family there. The Romani explain that they are not allowed to camp anywhere else so Haddock invites them to the grounds of his estate, [[Marlinspike Hall]].{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=1\u20134}}\n\nHaddock has been trying to get the local stonemason Arthur Bolt to fix a broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva [[Bianca Castafiore]] invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore presents Haddock with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=5\u201310}}\n\nThe magazine ''Paris Flash'' claim that Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, on the basis of a misinterpreted interview with [[Professor Calculus]]. This results in an avalanche of congratulations from Haddock's friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary [[Power outage|power cut]]. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case she herself had misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine ''Tempo di Roma'' with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a [[paparazzi|paparazzo]].{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=11\u201342}}\n\nA few days later, Castafiore's most valuable jewel, an emerald given to her by the fictional [[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko#The Valley of the Cobras|Maharajah of Gopal]], goes missing. After initially questioning Irma, Nestor and Calculus, the detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] suspect the Romani. Their suspicions are heightened when they find that a pair of golden scissors belonging to Irma in Miarka's possession, though she claims to have found them. After the Romani depart, the police start looking for them. Tintin also investigates Igor Wagner, whose behaviour he finds suspicious, but finds out that the musician is simply sneaking out to indulge in a [[Gambling#Parimutuel betting|horse-gambling]] habit.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=43\u201355}}\n\nCastafiore leaves for Milan to perform in the opera ''[[La gazza ladra]]'' (Italian: ''The Thieving Magpie''). Tintin realises that the true culprit responsible for the theft of the emerald and the scissors is a [[magpie]]. He explains to Haddock that the scissors must have fallen out of the nest only to be found by Miarka. Tintin retrieves the emerald and hands it to Thomson and Thompson, who return it to Castafiore. Sometime later, Bolt mends the broken step, only for Haddock to inadvertently step on it and slip again while the cement is still wet.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=56\u201362}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"When I began this book, my aim was to tell a story where nothing happened.

Greg produced two plot outlines, ''Les Pilulues'' (\"The Pills\") and ''[[Le Thermoz\u00e9ro|Tintin et le Thermoz\u00e9ro]]'' (\"Tintin and the Thermozero\"). Herg\u00e9 began drawing the latter of these stories, but soon abandoned it.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=285\u2013287}} Instead, he decided to set his new ''Adventure'' entirely at Marlinspike Hall, the only instalment in the series to do this.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|pp=168, 171}} This was the first and last adventure after ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' (1943) to be set entirely in Belgium,{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=113}} and he admitted that with his proposed scenario, it was difficult \"to create suspense, a semblance of danger.\"{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}} The titles that Herg\u00e9 had previously considered for the book were: ''The Castafiore Affair'', ''Castafiore's Sapphire'', ''The Castafiore Jewels'' and ''The Captain and the Nightingale'', but ''The Castafiore Emerald'' eventually emerged as the favourite.{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=195}}\n\nHerg\u00e9's depiction of Bianca Castafiore in the story&nbsp;\u2013 a famous opera singer, pursued by the press, and changing her outfit for every occasion&nbsp;\u2013 was influenced by the life of the opera singer [[Maria Callas]].{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} One of the new characters that Herg\u00e9 introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Herg\u00e9.{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=183|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=171}} Herg\u00e9's depiction of the [[paparazzi]] within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the ''Paris Flash'', are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of ''[[The Black Island]]'' (1938) by [[Bob de Moor]], also making a reappearance in ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]'' (1976).{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=172|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=77}}{{efn|The duo are unnamed in ''The Black Island'',{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1975|p=61}} with their names revealed by Castafiore in ''The Castafiore Emerald''.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|p=22}}}} The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.{{Sfn|Goddin|2011|p=123}}\n\n[[File:Cheverny 01.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Cheverny]] in [[France]] was used as the basis for Haddock's family estate, [[Marlinspike Hall]] or Moulinsart in the original French version.{{Sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=76|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=115|3a1=Farr|3y=2001|3p=106|4a1=Lofficier|4a2=Lofficier|4y=2002|4p=53}}]]\nOn page 17 of the book, Jolyon Wagg mentions Castafiore's Emerald to be a gift from, in his own words, \"some character, Marjorie something or other...\", to which Castafiore corrects Wagg by saying it was from the Maharajah of Gopal.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|p=17}} The Maharajah of Gopal does not make an appearance in ''The Adventures of Tintin'', but is one of the main characters in ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko#The Valley of the Cobras|The Valley of the Cobras]]'' (1956), which is a part of another [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series created by Herg\u00e9, ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko|The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1935\u20131958).{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=184|2a1=Farr|2y=2007|2p=72}} Herg\u00e9 also introduced the [[Romani people]], members of whose community had previously appeared in ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko#The Stratoship H-22|Destination New York]]'' (1951), another book from ''The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko''.{{Sfn|Matras|2015|p=204}} The idea of including them in the story was inspired by an occasion on which Herg\u00e9 came across a Romani gypsy camp near to his country home in C\u00e9roux-Mousty.{{Sfn|Goddin|2011|p=121}} To ensure that his depiction of them had some accuracy, he approached Father Rupert in [[Verviers]], who had some experience with the community, reassuring him that \"The episode with the Romas will not pain you\". {{Sfn|Goddin|2011|p=125}}\n\n''The Castafiore Emerald'' was also one of the few instances of romance seen in ''The Adventures of Tintin'', which begins when Calculus breeds a new variety of white-coloured roses, and names it \"Bianca\" in honour of Castafiore. At her departure, Calculus presents a bouquet of the roses he created to Castafiore, who happily receives them and embraces Calculus, kissing him in the process. Unlike Haddock, who resents being kissed by Castafiore, Calculus willingly accepts it and blushes.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}} Calculus also makes an imperfect attempt at [[colour television]], which according to [[Michael Farr]], was \"some five years ahead of its day.\"{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}}\n\n=== Influences ===\n[[File:Th calculus.jpg|thumb|right|Castafiore's mention of Calculus' \"ascents in balloons\" is a reference to [[Auguste Piccard]], based on whom Calculus was modelled.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|page=176}}]]\nThe incident of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the \"Marlinspike Prize Band\" (Harmonie de Moulinsart in the original French version), was based on a similar experience of Herg\u00e9's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks.{{efn|[[Michael Farr]] does not mention the band's name.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}}}} To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to \"[[Spirou (character)|Spirou]]\", the cartoon character created by [[Robert Velter]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=183|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=172}} Another influence for the band was a cutting of \"L'Orpheon France\" band.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels were stolen, her expressions, which involve placing her hands on her face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, [[Maria Callas]], taken by [[Cecil Beaton]] in 1957.{{Sfn|Farr|2007|p=72}} In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883), which was also one of Herg\u00e9's favourite books.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}} The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Herg\u00e9 had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}}\n\nThe book alludes to the well-known French weekly ''[[Paris Match]]'' in its depiction of the reporters from the magazine ''Paris Flash'' and jibes at its reputation for the questionable accuracy of the articles.{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=172|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=77}} Herg\u00e9's use of the word ''Paris Flash'' is also based on a previous encounter of his with the ''Paris Match'' when it featured an \"error-ridden\" article on him.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=78}} It also mentions a fashion designing company named Tristan Bior, based upon the French [[luxury goods]] company, [[Christian Dior]].{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} Andy (Andr\u00e9 in the original French version), the director of the television crew belonging to the fictional company, Supavision, was compared by Farr to an employee of Belgian Television, Jacques Cogniaux.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}} In a tribute to [[Auguste Piccard]], Calculus' model in real life, Castafiore greets him as a famous balloonist.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|pp=175\u2013176}}\nHerg\u00e9 also inserted references to previous stories in the narrative; he included the three models of the ''[[Unicorn (ship)|Unicorn]]'', originally featured in ''The Secret of the Unicorn'', in a background scene at Marlinspike Hall.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=184}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n''The Castafiore Emerald'' was serialised weekly from 4 July 1961 to 4 September 1962 in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine and published in book form as ''Les Bijoux de la Castafiore'' by Casterman in 1963.{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=175|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=76}} For the English version of the book, the [[gramophone record]] that Tintin receives from Castafiore, which is the \"Jewel Song\" from [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', is titled \"Margarethe\", the name by which Gounod's opera is known in Germany but not in England.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}}\n\n''The Castafiore Emerald'' was the first book in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' that was published in England the same year {{mdash}} 1963 {{mdash}} it was published in Belgium and [[France]].{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}} When Herg\u00e9 read the English version of the book,{{efn|Stated by [[Pierre Assouline]] as the \"British edition\".{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=196}}}} he found it to be \"absolutely delirious\" and even suggested to translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, \"You really would think that this was originally written in English.\"{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=196}} In the original French version, Calculus ignores Haddock's attempt to refer to the latest developments of colour television in the [[United States]] when presenting his prototype; this does not occur in the English edition.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}}\n\n== Critical analysis ==\nThe book was considered by critics to be an [[antithesis]] of the previous Tintin ventures.{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=171|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=77}} Michael Farr, author of ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'', stated that in ''The Castafiore Emerald'', Herg\u00e9 permits Haddock to remain at home in Marlinspike, an ideal that the \"increasingly travel weary\" character had long cherished,{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} further stating that if Herg\u00e9 had decided to end the Tintin series, ''The Castafiore Emerald'' would have been \"a suitable final volume\".{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} He compared the story to the detective novels by [[Agatha Christie]], in that the narrative was \"littered from start to finish with clues, most of which are false\", misleading both Tintin and the reader.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} He felt that in setting the story entirely at Marlinspike, Herg\u00e9 \"deliberately broke the classic adventure mould he had created\", and in doing so \"succeeded in creating a masterpiece in the manner of a well constructed stage comedy or farce\". Farr viewed the volume as \"a tour de force\", noting that it was quite dissimilar to any other instalment in ''The Adventures of Tintin''. As such, he felt that it would have been a suitable story on which to end the series.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} As a result of its \"experimental, exceptional nature\", Farr believed that ''The Castafiore Emerald'' \"never gained the public recognition it merits\", stating that while attracting \"a loyal following\" it had not become one of the most popular ''Adventures of Tintin'', something that he thought was \"unjust\".{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}}\n\n[[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier, co-authors of the book, ''The Pocket Essential Tintin'', described Herg\u00e9's depiction of Castafiore in the story as \"a force of nature\", praising the way that he depicted her many outfit changes.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=76}} They described Mr Bolt as being both a \"[[Waiting for Godot|Godot-like character]]\" and as being akin to [[Basil Fawlty]] from the British sitcom ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', while adding that the broken step acts \"like a Greek God's curse\" in the story that affects everyone except Castafiore.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=76\u201377}}\nThey interpreted ''The Castafiore Emerald'' as Herg\u00e9's ''[[Nouveau Roman]]'', in which he realises that he cannot improve upon the standard set in ''Tintin in Tibet'' and thus decides to \"deconstruct his own myth and create the antithesis of a ''Tintin'' adventure.\"{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=77}} Given that accidents and bad luck befall most of the characters in the story, Lofficier and Lofficier described the story as \"a comedy of errors, a wonderful tribute to [[Murphy's Law]].\"{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=77\u201378}} Ultimately, they awarded the story four stars out of five.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Benoit Peeters 20100329 Salon du livre de Paris 3.jpg|thumb|right|Herg\u00e9 biographer [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] ''(pictured, 2010)'' described ''The Castafiore Emerald'' as \"the most surprising of Tintin's adventures\".{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}}]]\n\nEnglish screenwriter and author of ''Tintin: Herg\u00e9 and his Creation'' (1991), [[Harry Thompson]] stated that in ''The Castafiore Emerald'', \"everything is topsy-turvy\", with obvious villains being shown to be harmless, and alleged crimes turning out to have not happened.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=184}} He thought that Haddock was a clear parallel for Herg\u00e9 himself in the story, representing his own desires and frustrations.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=183}} Ultimately, he considered the volume to be \"Herg\u00e9's masterpiece\" when it came to technical issues, representing \"the high tide of his creative abilities\".{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=182}}\n\nHerg\u00e9 biographer [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] described the story as \"the most surprising of Tintin's adventures\", with Herg\u00e9 having been \"determined to push his reexamination of the comic strip even further.\"{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}} He noted that in the story, Castafiore's \"dramatic femininity\" disrupted the \"idea of sociability\" that pervaded Marlinspike, with its \"proper respect of space, a form of harmony in independence\".{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}}  He added that \"this casually alluring tale is one of the most subtly handled of the adventures; a riot of clues, both real and false, give ''The Castafiore Emerald'' an unequaled density\",{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=287\u2013288}} elsewhere referring to it as \"a catalogue of mishaps with nothing or no one spared\".{{Sfn|Peeters|1989|p=116}}\nHe described it as having brought to the foreground the \"anarchist and non-conformist tendencies of Herg\u00e9's work\" which had previously been shown in ''[[Quick & Flupke]]''.{{Sfn|Peeters|1989|p=116}}\nHe also saw the book as being \"a sort of flashback\" for Herg\u00e9, allowing him to relive events from his own past; thus, Peeters thought that the constant renovations at Marlinspike represented the constant renovations at Herg\u00e9's country home of C\u00e9roux-Mousty, while Haddock's time in the wheelchair represented his former wife's Germaine time spent similarly disabled, and Castafiore was a parody of Germaine herself.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=288}} Ultimately, he felt that the story&nbsp;\u2013 \"the last great adventure of Tintin\"&nbsp;\u2013 was \"also a swan song\", for Herg\u00e9 \"did not dare to continue down this path, where not all of his readers had followed him\", and which had represented \"a permanent loss of innocence.\"{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=289}}\n\n== Adaptations ==\nIn June 1970, a long article on ''The Castafiore Emerald'' by French philosopher and author, [[Michel Serres]], appeared in the literary review, ''Critique'', under the title, ''Les Bijoux distraits ou la cantatrice sauve''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=196|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=369}}\n\nIn 1991, a collaboration between the French studio [[Ellipse]] and the Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]] adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. ''The Castafiore Emerald'' was the nineteenth story of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' to be adapted. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \"generally faithful\", with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=Herg\u00e9, the Man Who Created Tintin |last=Assouline |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Assouline |others=Charles Ruas (translator) |year=2009 |origyear=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford and New York |isbn=978-0-19-539759-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YsyEMjvdYJgC |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin: The Complete Companion |last=Farr |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Farr |year=2001 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-5522-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcytngEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin & Co |last=Farr |first=Michael |year=2007 |publisher=[[Egmont Group|Egmont]] |location=London |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NFqrJQAACAAJ |isbn=978-1-4052-3264-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Art of Herg\u00e9, Inventor of Tintin: Volume 3: 1950-1983 |last=Goddin |first=Philippe |authorlink=Philippe Goddin |others=Michael Farr (translator) |year=2011 |publisher=Last Gasp |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-8671-9763-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk4CaAEACAAJ&source=gbs_book_other_versions |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Castafiore Emerald |last=Herg\u00e9 |authorlink=Herg\u00e9 |others=Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner (translators) |year=1963 |publisher=Egmont |location=London |isbn=978-1-4352-2975-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aog7NQAACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Black Island |last=Herg\u00e9 |others=Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner (translators) |year=1975 |publisher=Mammoth |location=London |isbn=978-0-3163-5835-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0CnBQAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Pocket Essential Tintin |last1=Lofficier |first1=Jean-Marc |last2=Lofficier |first2=Randy |authorlink1=Jean-Marc Lofficier |year=2002 |publisher=Pocket Essentials |location=Harpenden, Hertfordshire |isbn=978-1-904048-17-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kburngEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Romani Gypsies |publisher=Harvard University Press |first=Yaron |last=Matras |year=2015 |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-6743-6838-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YfQ9BQAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin and the World of Herg\u00e9 |last=Peeters |first=Beno\u00eet |authorlink=Beno\u00eet Peeters |year=1989 |publisher=Methuen Children's Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-416-14882-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P97GQgAACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Herg\u00e9: Son of Tintin |last=Peeters |first=Beno\u00eet |authorlink=Beno\u00eet Peeters |others=Tina A.

It was serialised weekly from July 1961 to September 1962 in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine. In contrast to the previous Tintin books, Herg\u00e9 deliberately broke the adventure formula he had created: it is the only book in the series where the characters remain at [[Marlinspike Hall]], [[Captain Haddock]]'s family estate, and neither travel abroad nor confront dangerous criminals. The plot concerns the visit of the opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]] and the subsequent theft of her emerald.\n\nAlthough ''The Castafiore Emerald'' received critical acclaim for its humourous depiction of its characters follow a trail of [[red herrings]], it failed to match the commercial success of previous volumes due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by [[Casterman]] shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]'', while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]]. The story was adapted for both the 1991 [[Ellipse Programm\u00e9|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and the 1992-3 [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] dramatisation of the ''Adventures''.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Captain Haddock]] are walking through the countryside of [[List of The Adventures of Tintin locations#Alphabetical list|Marlinshire]] when they come across a [[Romani people|Romani]] community camped in a [[garbage dump]], and reunite a lost little girl named Miarka with her family there. The Romani explain that they are not allowed to camp anywhere else so Haddock invites them to the grounds of his estate, [[Marlinspike Hall]].{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=1\u20134}}\n\nHaddock has been trying to get the local stonemason Arthur Bolt to fix a broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva [[Bianca Castafiore]] invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore presents Haddock with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=5\u201310}}\n\nThe magazine ''Paris Flash'' claim that Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, on the basis of a misinterpreted interview with [[Professor Calculus]]. This results in an avalanche of congratulations from Haddock's friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary [[Power outage|power cut]]. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case she herself had misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine ''Tempo di Roma'' with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a [[paparazzi|paparazzo]].{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=11\u201342}}\n\nA few days later, Castafiore's most valuable jewel, an emerald given to her by the fictional [[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko#The Valley of the Cobras|Maharajah of Gopal]], goes missing. After initially questioning Irma, Nestor and Calculus, the detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] suspect the Romani. Their suspicions are heightened when they find that a pair of golden scissors belonging to Irma in Miarka's possession, though she claims to have found them. After the Romani depart, the police start looking for them. Tintin also investigates Igor Wagner, whose behaviour he finds suspicious, but finds out that the musician is simply sneaking out to indulge in a [[Gambling#Parimutuel betting|horse-gambling]] habit.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=43\u201355}}\n\nCastafiore leaves for Milan to perform in the opera ''[[La gazza ladra]]'' (Italian: ''The Thieving Magpie''). Tintin realises that the true culprit responsible for the theft of the emerald and the scissors is a [[magpie]]. He explains to Haddock that the scissors must have fallen out of the nest only to be found by Miarka. Tintin retrieves the emerald and hands it to Thomson and Thompson, who return it to Castafiore. Sometime later, Bolt mends the broken step, only for Haddock to inadvertently step on it and slip again while the cement is still wet.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|pp=56\u201362}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"When I began this book, my aim was to tell a story where nothing happened.

Greg produced two plot outlines, ''Les Pilulues'' (\"The Pills\") and ''[[Le Thermoz\u00e9ro|Tintin et le Thermoz\u00e9ro]]'' (\"Tintin and the Thermozero\"). Herg\u00e9 began drawing the latter of these stories, but soon abandoned it.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=285\u2013287}} Instead, he decided to set his new ''Adventure'' entirely at Marlinspike Hall, the only instalment in the series to do this.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|pp=168, 171}} This was the first and last adventure after ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' (1943) to be set entirely in Belgium,{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=113}} and he admitted that with his proposed scenario, it was difficult \"to create suspense, a semblance of danger.\"{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}} The titles that Herg\u00e9 had previously considered for the book were: ''The Castafiore Affair'', ''Castafiore's Sapphire'', ''The Castafiore Jewels'' and ''The Captain and the Nightingale'', but ''The Castafiore Emerald'' eventually emerged as the favourite.{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=195}}\n\nHerg\u00e9's depiction of Bianca Castafiore in the story&nbsp;\u2013 a famous opera singer, pursued by the press, and changing her outfit for every occasion&nbsp;\u2013 was influenced by the life of the opera singer [[Maria Callas]].{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} One of the new characters that Herg\u00e9 introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Herg\u00e9.{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=183|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=171}} Herg\u00e9's depiction of the [[paparazzi]] within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the ''Paris Flash'', are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of ''[[The Black Island]]'' (1938) by [[Bob de Moor]], also making a reappearance in ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]'' (1976).{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=172|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=77}}{{efn|The duo are unnamed in ''The Black Island'',{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1975|p=61}} with their names revealed by Castafiore in ''The Castafiore Emerald''.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|p=22}}}} The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.{{Sfn|Goddin|2011|p=123}}\n\n[[File:Cheverny 01.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Cheverny]] in [[France]] was used as the basis for Haddock's family estate, [[Marlinspike Hall]] or Moulinsart in the original French version.{{Sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=76|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=115|3a1=Farr|3y=2001|3p=106|4a1=Lofficier|4a2=Lofficier|4y=2002|4p=53}}]]\nOn page 17 of the book, Jolyon Wagg mentions Castafiore's Emerald to be a gift from, in his own words, \"some character, Marjorie something or other...\", to which Castafiore corrects Wagg by saying it was from the Maharajah of Gopal.{{Sfn|Herg\u00e9|1963|p=17}} The Maharajah of Gopal does not make an appearance in ''The Adventures of Tintin'', but is one of the main characters in ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko#The Valley of the Cobras|The Valley of the Cobras]]'' (1956), which is a part of another [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series created by Herg\u00e9, ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko|The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1935\u20131958).{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=184|2a1=Farr|2y=2007|2p=72}} Herg\u00e9 also introduced the [[Romani people]], members of whose community had previously appeared in ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko#The Stratoship H-22|Destination New York]]'' (1951), another book from ''The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko''.{{Sfn|Matras|2015|p=204}} The idea of including them in the story was inspired by an occasion on which Herg\u00e9 came across a Romani gypsy camp near to his country home in C\u00e9roux-Mousty.{{Sfn|Goddin|2011|p=121}} To ensure that his depiction of them had some accuracy, he approached Father Rupert in [[Verviers]], who had some experience with the community, reassuring him that \"The episode with the Romas will not pain you\". {{Sfn|Goddin|2011|p=125}}\n\n''The Castafiore Emerald'' was also one of the few instances of romance seen in ''The Adventures of Tintin'', which begins when Calculus breeds a new variety of white-coloured roses, and names it \"Bianca\" in honour of Castafiore. At her departure, Calculus presents a bouquet of the roses he created to Castafiore, who happily receives them and embraces Calculus, kissing him in the process. Unlike Haddock, who resents being kissed by Castafiore, Calculus willingly accepts it and blushes.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}} Calculus also makes an imperfect attempt at [[colour television]], which according to [[Michael Farr]], was \"some five years ahead of its day.\"{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}}\n\n=== Influences ===\n[[File:Th calculus.jpg|thumb|right|Castafiore's mention of Calculus' \"ascents in balloons\" is a reference to [[Auguste Piccard]], based on whom Calculus was modelled.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|page=176}}]]\nThe incident of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the \"Marlinspike Prize Band\" (Harmonie de Moulinsart in the original French version), was based on a similar experience of Herg\u00e9's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks.{{efn|[[Michael Farr]] does not mention the band's name.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}}}} To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to \"[[Spirou (character)|Spirou]]\", the cartoon character created by [[Robert Velter]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=183|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=172}} Another influence for the band was a cutting of \"L'Orpheon France\" band.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels were stolen, her expressions, which involve placing her hands on her face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, [[Maria Callas]], taken by [[Cecil Beaton]] in 1957.{{Sfn|Farr|2007|p=72}} In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883), which was also one of Herg\u00e9's favourite books.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}} The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Herg\u00e9 had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}}\n\nThe book alludes to the well-known French weekly ''[[Paris Match]]'' in its depiction of the reporters from the magazine ''Paris Flash'' and jibes at its reputation for the questionable accuracy of the articles.{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=172|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=77}} Herg\u00e9's use of the word ''Paris Flash'' is also based on a previous encounter of his with the ''Paris Match'' when it featured an \"error-ridden\" article on him.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=78}} It also mentions a fashion designing company named Tristan Bior, based upon the French [[luxury goods]] company, [[Christian Dior]].{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=172}} Andy (Andr\u00e9 in the original French version), the director of the television crew belonging to the fictional company, Supavision, was compared by Farr to an employee of Belgian Television, Jacques Cogniaux.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}} In a tribute to [[Auguste Piccard]], Calculus' model in real life, Castafiore greets him as a famous balloonist.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|pp=175\u2013176}}\nHerg\u00e9 also inserted references to previous stories in the narrative; he included the three models of the ''[[Unicorn (ship)|Unicorn]]'', originally featured in ''The Secret of the Unicorn'', in a background scene at Marlinspike Hall.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=184}}\n\n=== Publication ===\n''The Castafiore Emerald'' was serialised weekly from 4 July 1961 to 4 September 1962 in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine and published in book form as ''Les Bijoux de la Castafiore'' by Casterman in 1963.{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=175|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=76}} For the English version of the book, the [[gramophone record]] that Tintin receives from Castafiore, which is the \"Jewel Song\" from [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', is titled \"Margarethe\", the name by which Gounod's opera is known in Germany but not in England.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}}\n\n''The Castafiore Emerald'' was the first book in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' that was published in England the same year {{mdash}} 1963 {{mdash}} it was published in Belgium and [[France]].{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=175}} When Herg\u00e9 read the English version of the book,{{efn|Stated by [[Pierre Assouline]] as the \"British edition\".{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=196}}}} he found it to be \"absolutely delirious\" and even suggested to translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, \"You really would think that this was originally written in English.\"{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=196}} In the original French version, Calculus ignores Haddock's attempt to refer to the latest developments of colour television in the [[United States]] when presenting his prototype; this does not occur in the English edition.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}}\n\n== Critical analysis ==\nThe book was considered by critics to be an [[antithesis]] of the previous Tintin ventures.{{Sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=171|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=77}} Michael Farr, author of ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'', stated that in ''The Castafiore Emerald'', Herg\u00e9 permits Haddock to remain at home in Marlinspike, an ideal that the \"increasingly travel weary\" character had long cherished,{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} further stating that if Herg\u00e9 had decided to end the Tintin series, ''The Castafiore Emerald'' would have been \"a suitable final volume\".{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} He compared the story to the detective novels by [[Agatha Christie]], in that the narrative was \"littered from start to finish with clues, most of which are false\", misleading both Tintin and the reader.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} He felt that in setting the story entirely at Marlinspike, Herg\u00e9 \"deliberately broke the classic adventure mould he had created\", and in doing so \"succeeded in creating a masterpiece in the manner of a well constructed stage comedy or farce\". Farr viewed the volume as \"a tour de force\", noting that it was quite dissimilar to any other instalment in ''The Adventures of Tintin''. As such, he felt that it would have been a suitable story on which to end the series.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=171}} As a result of its \"experimental, exceptional nature\", Farr believed that ''The Castafiore Emerald'' \"never gained the public recognition it merits\", stating that while attracting \"a loyal following\" it had not become one of the most popular ''Adventures of Tintin'', something that he thought was \"unjust\".{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=176}}\n\n[[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier, co-authors of the book, ''The Pocket Essential Tintin'', described Herg\u00e9's depiction of Castafiore in the story as \"a force of nature\", praising the way that he depicted her many outfit changes.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=76}} They described Mr Bolt as being both a \"[[Waiting for Godot|Godot-like character]]\" and as being akin to [[Basil Fawlty]] from the British sitcom ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', while adding that the broken step acts \"like a Greek God's curse\" in the story that affects everyone except Castafiore.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=76\u201377}}\nThey interpreted ''The Castafiore Emerald'' as Herg\u00e9's ''[[Nouveau Roman]]'', in which he realises that he cannot improve upon the standard set in ''Tintin in Tibet'' and thus decides to \"deconstruct his own myth and create the antithesis of a ''Tintin'' adventure.\"{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=77}} Given that accidents and bad luck befall most of the characters in the story, Lofficier and Lofficier described the story as \"a comedy of errors, a wonderful tribute to [[Murphy's Law]].\"{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=77\u201378}} Ultimately, they awarded the story four stars out of five.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Benoit Peeters 20100329 Salon du livre de Paris 3.jpg|thumb|right|Herg\u00e9 biographer [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] ''(pictured, 2010)'' described ''The Castafiore Emerald'' as \"the most surprising of Tintin's adventures\".{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}}]]\n\nEnglish screenwriter and author of ''Tintin: Herg\u00e9 and his Creation'' (1991), [[Harry Thompson]] stated that in ''The Castafiore Emerald'', \"everything is topsy-turvy\", with obvious villains being shown to be harmless, and alleged crimes turning out to have not happened.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=184}} He thought that Haddock was a clear parallel for Herg\u00e9 himself in the story, representing his own desires and frustrations.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=183}} Ultimately, he considered the volume to be \"Herg\u00e9's masterpiece\" when it came to technical issues, representing \"the high tide of his creative abilities\".{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=182}}\n\nHerg\u00e9 biographer [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] described the story as \"the most surprising of Tintin's adventures\", with Herg\u00e9 having been \"determined to push his reexamination of the comic strip even further.\"{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}} He noted that in the story, Castafiore's \"dramatic femininity\" disrupted the \"idea of sociability\" that pervaded Marlinspike, with its \"proper respect of space, a form of harmony in independence\".{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=287}}  He added that \"this casually alluring tale is one of the most subtly handled of the adventures; a riot of clues, both real and false, give ''The Castafiore Emerald'' an unequaled density\",{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=287\u2013288}} elsewhere referring to it as \"a catalogue of mishaps with nothing or no one spared\".{{Sfn|Peeters|1989|p=116}}\nHe described it as having brought to the foreground the \"anarchist and non-conformist tendencies of Herg\u00e9's work\" which had previously been shown in ''[[Quick & Flupke]]''.{{Sfn|Peeters|1989|p=116}}\nHe also saw the book as being \"a sort of flashback\" for Herg\u00e9, allowing him to relive events from his own past; thus, Peeters thought that the constant renovations at Marlinspike represented the constant renovations at Herg\u00e9's country home of C\u00e9roux-Mousty, while Haddock's time in the wheelchair represented his former wife's Germaine time spent similarly disabled, and Castafiore was a parody of Germaine herself.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=288}} Ultimately, he felt that the story&nbsp;\u2013 \"the last great adventure of Tintin\"&nbsp;\u2013 was \"also a swan song\", for Herg\u00e9 \"did not dare to continue down this path, where not all of his readers had followed him\", and which had represented \"a permanent loss of innocence.\"{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=289}}\n\n== Adaptations ==\nIn June 1970, a long article on ''The Castafiore Emerald'' by French philosopher and author, [[Michel Serres]], appeared in the literary review, ''Critique'', under the title, ''Les Bijoux distraits ou la cantatrice sauve''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=196|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=369}}\n\nIn 1991, a collaboration between the French studio [[Ellipse]] and the Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]] adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. ''The Castafiore Emerald'' was the nineteenth story of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' to be adapted. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \"generally faithful\", with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.{{Sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=Herg\u00e9, the Man Who Created Tintin |last=Assouline |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Assouline |others=Charles Ruas (translator) |year=2009 |origyear=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford and New York |isbn=978-0-19-539759-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YsyEMjvdYJgC |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin: The Complete Companion |last=Farr |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Farr |year=2001 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-5522-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcytngEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin & Co |last=Farr |first=Michael |year=2007 |publisher=[[Egmont Group|Egmont]] |location=London |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NFqrJQAACAAJ |isbn=978-1-4052-3264-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Art of Herg\u00e9, Inventor of Tintin: Volume 3: 1950-1983 |last=Goddin |first=Philippe |authorlink=Philippe Goddin |others=Michael Farr (translator) |year=2011 |publisher=Last Gasp |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-8671-9763-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk4CaAEACAAJ&source=gbs_book_other_versions |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Castafiore Emerald |last=Herg\u00e9 |authorlink=Herg\u00e9 |others=Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner (translators) |year=1963 |publisher=Egmont |location=London |isbn=978-1-4352-2975-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aog7NQAACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Black Island |last=Herg\u00e9 |others=Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner (translators) |year=1975 |publisher=Mammoth |location=London |isbn=978-0-3163-5835-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0CnBQAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Pocket Essential Tintin |last1=Lofficier |first1=Jean-Marc |last2=Lofficier |first2=Randy |authorlink1=Jean-Marc Lofficier |year=2002 |publisher=Pocket Essentials |location=Harpenden, Hertfordshire |isbn=978-1-904048-17-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kburngEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Romani Gypsies |publisher=Harvard University Press |first=Yaron |last=Matras |year=2015 |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-6743-6838-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YfQ9BQAAQBAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin and the World of Herg\u00e9 |last=Peeters |first=Beno\u00eet |authorlink=Beno\u00eet Peeters |year=1989 |publisher=Methuen Children's Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-416-14882-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P97GQgAACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Herg\u00e9: Son of Tintin |last=Peeters |first=Beno\u00eet |authorlink=Beno\u00eet Peeters |others=Tina A.
