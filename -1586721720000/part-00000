Appointed by Governor [[Dudley de Chair|Sir Dudley de Chair]] as [[President of the New South Wales Legislative Council|President of the Legislative Council]] from 1929, Peden was a leader in the opposition to [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] Premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s attempts to abolish the council. He drafted section 7A of the Constitution Act of 1902, added by amendment in 1929, to ensure that the council could not be abolished, nor its powers be altered, except through the expression of the people through a referendum.<ref name=ADB/> In the 1930 [[New Year Honours]], Peden was awarded the rank of [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG).<ref>{{cite web|title=PEDEN, John Beverley - The Order of St Michael and St George - Knights Commander|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1082536&search_type=quick&showInd=true|website=It's an Honour database|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=1 January 1930|quote=President of the NSW Legislative Council}}</ref>\n\nLang's inability to gain control in the Upper House obstructed his legislative program and, following a long-standing Labor policy to abolish the Legislative Council (Queensland Labor had been [[Queensland Legislative Council|similarly successful]] in 1922), in November 1930, claiming a mandate to abolish the Council, Lang's Labor MLCs put forward two bills, one to repeal section 7A and the other to abolish the Council. Lang had requested Governor [[Philip Game|Sir Philip Game]] and his predecessor, De Chair, for sufficient appointments to the Legislative Council in order to pass these bills, but on each occasion was met with refusal.<ref name=game>{{Cite web| title = Game, Sir Philip Woolcott (1876\u20131961) | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080629b.htm | accessdate =24 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nBelieving that a [[referendum]] was necessary before the bills could become law as per Peden's legal reasoning, the Legislative Council permitted the bills to pass without a division on 10 December. Lang then announced his intention of presenting the bills for Game's [[Royal assent]] without a referendum. The following day, two members of the Legislative Council, [[Thomas Alfred John Playfair|Thomas Playfair]] and [[Arthur Trethowan]], applied for and were granted an injunction preventing Lang and his ministers from presenting the bills to the Governor without having held a referendum; Peden, despite being a firm opponent to Lang's intentions was obliged as leader of the council to defend this challenge. Nevertheless, Peden was convinced of section 7A's validity under the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]]. On 23 December the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] in the case of ''Trethowan v. Peden'', upheld the injunction and ordered the government not to present for royal assent, unless ratified by the electors in a referendum, bills to abolish the council.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120136b.htm|title= Street, Sir Philip Whistler (1863\u20131938)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nLang immediately prepared an appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]]. In the case of ''Attorney-General (New South Wales) v. Trethowan'', the appeal was rejected by a majority of the court. Lang then appealed this decision to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The judgment of the Privy Council delivered on 31 May 1932 dismissed the appeal by the [[Government of New South Wales]] and the bills repealing Section 7A and abolishing the Legislative Council could not therefore be presented to the Governor for assent until they had been passed in a referendum.<ref name=asm>A. S. Morrison (1984), \"''Dominions Office Correspondence on the New South Wales Constitutional Crisis 1930\u20131932''\", London, University of London (PhD thesis).</ref> Faced with other problems, Lang's plans for abolition ultimately failed, culminating in his dismissal by Governor Game in 1932. Peden worked with Lang's successor as Premier, [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]], to pass major reforms to replace the appointed Legislative Council by a Council elected by the whole parliament to terms equivalent to four Assembly terms. Another consequence was to make the President of the Council elected by a majority of the elected members, rather than directly appointed by the Governor, making Peden the last individual to be appointed in this way.<ref name=nsw/> This was passed by referendum in 1933.\n\n==Later life==\nPeden, with his life appointment lapsed, was consequently elected to the new council on 23 April 1934 and continued serving as the first elected President of the Council. In later years, Peden served as president of the Japan-Australia Society and was a farmer at his rural property in [[Cobargo, New South Wales|Cobargo]], near [[Bega, New South Wales|Bega]]. A prominent Anglican, Peden was chancellor of the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] dioceses of [[Anglican Diocese of Bathurst|Bathurst]] and [[Diocese of Newcastle (Australia)|Newcastle]] and was involved in drafting a new constitution for the Church of England in Australia. On 22 April 1946, Peden retired from the council and remains the longest-serving president of that body. On his retirement from politics, his colleague Sir Henry Manning noted: \"By a proper appreciation of the duties of his office, Sir John, a great scholar, a great statesman, and a great constitutionalist, established traditions for this Chamber and for the public life of New South Wales.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17981941 |title=SIR JOHN PEDEN DEAD |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 June 1946 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nSurvived by his two daughters (his wife predeceased him in 1928), a month later he died on 31 May 1946 in the Scottish Hospital, Paddington.

Appointed by Governor [[Dudley de Chair|Sir Dudley de Chair]] as [[President of the New South Wales Legislative Council|President of the Legislative Council]] from 1929, Peden was a leader in the opposition to [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] Premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s attempts to abolish the council. He drafted section 7A of the Constitution Act of 1902, added by amendment in 1929, to ensure that the council could not be abolished, nor its powers be altered, except through the expression of the people through a referendum.<ref name=ADB/> In the 1930 [[New Year Honours]], Peden was awarded the rank of [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG).<ref>{{cite web|title=PEDEN, John Beverley - The Order of St Michael and St George - Knights Commander|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1082536&search_type=quick&showInd=true|website=It's an Honour database|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=1 January 1930|quote=President of the NSW Legislative Council}}</ref>\n\nLang's inability to gain control in the Upper House obstructed his legislative program and, following a long-standing Labor policy to abolish the Legislative Council (Queensland Labor had been [[Queensland Legislative Council|similarly successful]] in 1922), in November 1930, claiming a mandate to abolish the Council, Lang's Labor MLCs put forward two bills, one to repeal section 7A and the other to abolish the Council. Lang had requested Governor [[Philip Game|Sir Philip Game]] and his predecessor, De Chair, for sufficient appointments to the Legislative Council in order to pass these bills, but on each occasion was met with refusal.<ref name=game>{{Cite web| title = Game, Sir Philip Woolcott (1876\u20131961) | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080629b.htm | accessdate =24 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nBelieving that a [[referendum]] was necessary before the bills could become law as per Peden's legal reasoning, the Legislative Council permitted the bills to pass without a division on 10 December. Lang then announced his intention of presenting the bills for Game's [[Royal assent]] without a referendum. The following day, two members of the Legislative Council, [[Thomas Alfred John Playfair|Thomas Playfair]] and [[Arthur Trethowan]], applied for and were granted an injunction preventing Lang and his ministers from presenting the bills to the Governor without having held a referendum; Peden, despite being a firm opponent to Lang's intentions was obliged as leader of the council to defend this challenge. Nevertheless, Peden was convinced of section 7A's validity under the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]]. On 23 December the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] in the case of ''Trethowan v. Peden'', upheld the injunction and ordered the government not to present for royal assent, unless ratified by the electors in a referendum, bills to abolish the council.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120136b.htm|title= Street, Sir Philip Whistler (1863\u20131938)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nLang immediately prepared an appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]]. In the case of ''Attorney-General (New South Wales) v. Trethowan'', the appeal was rejected by a majority of the court. Lang then appealed this decision to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The judgment of the Privy Council delivered on 31 May 1932 dismissed the appeal by the [[Government of New South Wales]] and the bills repealing Section 7A and abolishing the Legislative Council could not therefore be presented to the Governor for assent until they had been passed in a referendum.<ref name=asm>A. S. Morrison (1984), \"''Dominions Office Correspondence on the New South Wales Constitutional Crisis 1930\u20131932''\", London, University of London (PhD thesis).</ref> Faced with other problems, Lang's plans for abolition ultimately failed, culminating in his dismissal by Governor Game in 1932. Peden worked with Lang's successor as Premier, [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]], to pass major reforms to replace the appointed Legislative Council by a Council elected by the whole parliament to terms equivalent to four Assembly terms. Another consequence was to make the President of the Council elected by a majority of the elected members, rather than directly appointed by the Governor, making Peden the last individual to be appointed in this way.<ref name=nsw/> This was passed by referendum in 1933.\n\n==Later life==\nPeden, with his life appointment lapsed, was consequently elected to the new council on 23 April 1934 and continued serving as the first elected President of the Council. In later years, Peden served as president of the Japan-Australia Society and was a farmer at his rural property in [[Cobargo, New South Wales|Cobargo]], near [[Bega, New South Wales|Bega]]. A prominent Anglican, Peden was chancellor of the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] dioceses of [[Anglican Diocese of Bathurst|Bathurst]] and [[Diocese of Newcastle (Australia)|Newcastle]] and was involved in drafting a new constitution for the Church of England in Australia. On 22 April 1946, Peden retired from the council and remains the longest-serving president of that body. On his retirement from politics, his colleague Sir Henry Manning noted: \"By a proper appreciation of the duties of his office, Sir John, a great scholar, a great statesman, and a great constitutionalist, established traditions for this Chamber and for the public life of New South Wales.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17981941 |title=SIR JOHN PEDEN DEAD |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 June 1946 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nSurvived by his two daughters (his wife predeceased him in 1928), a month later he died on 31 May 1946 in the Scottish Hospital, Paddington.

He was distantly related to the family of the politician [[Andrew Peacock]]. Educated at a local school, Peacock passed the Victorian civil service examination at 13 years of age, becoming briefly a school teacher and a clerk in [[Melbourne]]. Returning to Creswick, he worked as a mine manager, establishing his own business and buying several gold mines. He was prominent in the [[Australian Natives' Association]] and the movement for [[Australian federation]] in the 1880s and '90s.\n\n== Entry in Parliament ==\n[[File:A.J. Peacock (1898).jpg|thumb|left|Peacock in 1898.]]\nIn 1889 Peacock was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] for the seat of Clunes and Allendale, near [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], which he held for 43 years. Although he was a moderate liberal, he was a minister without portfolio in the conservative government of [[James Munro (Australian politician)|James Munro]] (1890&ndash;1892), and Minister for Public Instruction in the [[William Shiels|Shiels]] government (1892&ndash;1893) and [[Postmaster-General of Victoria|Postmaster-General]] 15 November 1892 to 23 January 1893.<ref name=parl>\n{{cite re-member\n|mid=640\n|name=Peacock, Sir Alexander James\n|accessdate=1 May 2013\n}}</ref> He was Chief Secretary in both the governments of Sir [[George Turner (Australian politician)|George Turner]] from 1894 to 1899 and 1900 to 1901, being also Minister for Public Instruction in the first and Minister for Labour in the second.\n\nIn 1897 Peacock was elected as one of the Victorian delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] which wrote the [[Australian Constitution]].\n\n== Premier for the first time ==\nIn 1901, he chose not to stand for new [[Parliament of Australia]]. This was partly because the federal electorate covering the area he represented, the seat of [[Division of Ballarat|Ballaarat]], was being contested by [[Alfred Deakin]]. \nInstead, he stayed in Victorian politics and when Premier Turner resigned to contest the first federal elections, Peacock succeeded him and became Premier.\n\nBut by this time public support for the liberals was waning, and the new conservative leader, [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]], mounted a public campaign for \"retrenchment\"\u2014reduction in the size of the Parliament and the public service, and cuts to government spending. Peacock as a good liberal resisted this campaign, but in June 1902 Irvine carried a vote of no-confidence in Peacock's government and at the subsequent election the liberals and their Labor allies were heavily defeated. He was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] in 1902.\n\nPeacock stayed in opposition during Irvine's ministry, but in 1907 he returned to office as Chief Secretary and Minister for Labour in the government of [[Thomas Bent]]. By this time the distinction between liberals and conservatives was fading in the face of the rising challenge of the Labor Party, and from about this time the non-Labor members became officially the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].\n\n== Premier for the second time ==\nPeacock was Minister for Public Instruction in the government of [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]] in 1913, and in June 1914 Watt resigned so he contest a seat in Federal Parliament, Peacock once again became Premier, and also Treasurer, at the head of a Liberal government.\n\nSoon afterwards, [[World War I]] broke out, and Peacock's government joined the initial enthusiastic response to the war. By 1916, however, the war was placing increasing strain on the Victorian economy, as labour shortages hit its important rural industries. This caused increased opposition to the Liberals in rural areas, led by the Victorian Farmers Union (which later became the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 Victoria|Country Party]]). In 1917 the Liberals were renamed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]]. At the November 1917 elections, the Nationalists were split into pro and anti-Peacock factions, and the anti-Peacock group swept the country seats. The anti-Peacock leader [[John Bowser]] then became Premier.\n\nPeacock was a very durable politician, however, and by 1920 he was back in office, as Minister for Public Instruction and Minister for Labour in [[Harry Lawson]]'s Nationalist government, positions he held until 1924.\n\n== Premier for the third time==\nThe coalition government that Lawson formed broke down in March 1924 when the Country Party made demands Lawson would not accept. The Country Party ministers resigned, and then united with Labor to bring Lawson down.  Lawson resigned and Peacock was again chosen as leader of the Nationalist Party and became Premier for the third time. He was still a liberal at heart, however, and immediately brought in a bill to reduce the disproportionate representation of country areas, a long-standing grievance. But his own followers rebelled and Peacock called an election, at which Labor emerged as the largest party, though well short of a majority. Peacock resigned again, and was succeeded by a minority Labor government led by [[George Prendergast]].\n\nAfter a few months on the backbench Peacock returned as Minister for Public Instruction and Minister for Labour in [[John Allan (Australian politician)|John Allan]]'s Country Party government, holding these positions until 1927, when he left ministerial office for the last time, 37 years after holding his first portfolio. In 1928 he was elected [[Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly|Speaker]], a position he held until his death in 1933. His widow [[Millie Peacock|Millie, Lady Peacock]], won the by-election at Allandale caused by his death, becoming the first woman member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\n== Mason ==\nPeacock served as Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of Victoria ([[Masonic Lodge]] or [[Freemasons]]) from 1900\u20131905.<ref>Kent Henderson, ''The Masonic Grand Masters of Australia'', Ian Drakeford Publishing, Bayswater, 1988, pp.162-164</ref> At age 39 he was the youngest person ever to obtain that position in Australian Freemasonry, before or since.<ref>Kent Henderson, ''The Masonic Grand Masters of Australia'', Ian Drakeford Publishing, Bayswater, 1988, pp.163</ref> He pleaded heavy parliamentary commitments when he retired as Grand Master in 1905.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Geoff Browne, ''A Biographical Register of the Victorian Parliament, 1900-84'', Government Printer, Melbourne, 1985\n*Don Garden, ''Victoria: A History'', Thomas Nelson, Melbourne, 1984\n*Kathleen Thompson and Geoffrey Serle, ''A Biographical Register of the Victorian Parliament, 1856-1900'', Australian National University Press, Canberra, 1972\n* Raymond Wright, ''A People's Counsel.

It was named after [[Malcolm MacDonald]], the then [[Governor-General of Malaya]]. One of the first [[high-rise building]]s in Orchard Road, the MacDonald House housed mainly British, American and Australian companies.

The successful bidder, [[Tinifia Investment]], paid [[Singapore dollar|S$]]36&nbsp;million for the [[Fee simple|freehold]] building in 2003, and closed the building for extensive interior renovations costing another S$12&nbsp;million, including the upgrading of the ceilings, floors, [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] and [[elevator|lift]]s, and the introduction of [[car park]]ing facilities with the addition of a mechanical parking system for 30 [[car]]s.\n\nThe building re-opened in April 2005 with full occupancy. [[McCann Worldgroup]] occupies the fifth to eighth floors while a beauty/[[day spa|spa]] operator, [[Expressions International]], takes up the top two floors.

The firm was established by [[Colonel]] P.O.G. Wakeham in Singapore shortly after [[World War II]]. It was probably the longest established and one of the best known architectural firms in Southeast Asia, having been formed in Shanghai circa 1882.\n\nThe MacDonald House is one of Palmer and Turner's first buildings in Singapore, and was built for [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]]. It was the first large office building of the post-war period.\n\nThe building was built in a [[Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] style.

It was designed by [[James Wyatt]] and opened in 1772. The main [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was one of the largest rooms built in England up to that time and had a central [[dome]] somewhat reminiscent of the celebrated [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. It was built as a set of winter [[assembly rooms]] and later briefly converted into a theatre. Before being demolished in 1937, it was a bazaar and a wine merchant's show room for over a hundred years. [[Marks and Spencer]]'s \"Oxford Street Pantheon\" branch, at 173 Oxford Street now occupies the site.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Pantheon Oxford Street edited.jpg|thumb|The Oxford Street facade.]]\nThe Pantheon was promoted by Philip Elias Turst, of whose life very little else is known. In 1769 he inherited a plot of land which had a frontage of {{convert|54|ft|m}} on Oxford Street and contained two houses, behind which there was a large piece of ground enclosed by the gardens of houses in [[Great Marlborough Street]], Poland Street and Oxford Street. He had some connections with fashionable society, including a lady of means named Margaretta Maria Ellice, who was involved in the management of a fashionable set of assembly rooms in [[Soho Square]]. Miss Ellice was briefly Turst's main financial backer, and took soundings to ensure that a new place of public entertainment on an ambitious scale for the winter [[social season|season]] similar to [[Ranelagh Gardens]] for the summer, would be \"likely to meet with the Approbation of the Nobility in General\". This assurance being forthcoming the scheme went ahead.\n\nAfter falling out with Miss Ellice, who had initially agreed to buy thirty of the fifty shares in the business for \u00a310,000, but soon withdrew, Turst issued fifty shares at \u00a3500 each and found buyers for all of them except one, which he kept for himself. This provided a budget of \u00a325,000 and work began in mid-1769.\n\n[[File:Pantheon Cross section edited.jpg|thumb|300px|A cross section of the rotunda, showing the dome and the colonnades.]]\nTurst soon found himself in legal conflict, not only with Miss Ellice, but also with some of his new investors, as the budget was exceeded, but in January 1772 the Pantheon was completed. The architect chosen for the job was [[James Wyatt]]. He was to become one of the most prominent British architects of his generation, but at that time he was unknown and aged just twenty-two or twenty-three. He appears to have had some sort of indirect connection with Turst, perhaps through his older brother [[Samuel Wyatt|Samuel]], who was to be the main contractor for the project.\n\nThe artists and craftsmen involved included the plasterer [[Joseph Rose (plasterer)|Joseph Rose]], the sculptor [[Joseph Nollekens]], who was paid \u00a3160 for four statues of Britannia, Liberty, the King and the Queen, and [[John Stretzle]], who built the organ for \u00a3300.\n\nIn August 1769, Turst purchased a [[leasehold]] house on the west side of Poland Street which backed on to the site of the Pantheon and built a secondary entrance there. This unbudgeted cost added more fuel to the legal fire. In 1771 one of the shareholders filed a bill of complaint against Turst in the [[Court of Chancery]], complaining of dishonest treatment. In 1773 and again in 1782 Turst in his turn filed complaints against several other shareholders. The outcome of these suits is not known.\n\n==The building==\n[[File:Pantheon ground floor plan.jpg|thumb|Plan.]]\n[[File:Pantheon painting, probably by William Hodges with figures by Zoffany edited.jpg|thumb|A painting of the interior in its original form.]]\n\nThe main part of the site consisted of two rectangles of land. The smaller of these was towards Oxford Street. There, the main doorway, sheltered by a [[portico]], and the two side doorways opened to a vestibule, {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|15|ft|m}} deep, which was divided by screen colonnades into three compartments. A central set of doors opened into the first of two card rooms, and two further pairs of doors opened onto corridors or galleries, giving access to the grand staircase and the great assembly room or rotunda. The total depth of the site was {{convert|204|ft|m}} and the maximum width was {{convert|96|ft|3|in|m}}.\n\nThere is general agreement that the scheme of the great room, or rotunda, was derived from [[Santa Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650140/James-Wyatt#ref12451 |title=James Wyatt (British architect) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> The central space was contained in a square of {{convert|60|ft|m}} topped by a [[coffer]]ed [[dome]].

[[Horace Walpole]] compared Wyatt's work favourably with that of better established and very fashionable [[Robert Adam]], \"the Pantheon is still the most beautiful edifice in England\" he said. [[Dr. Burney]], writing long after the destruction of the original building by fire (an event which inflicted on him a heavy financial loss), when the first wave of enthusiasm had long been dissipated, stated that the Pantheon \"was built by Mr. James Wyatt, and regarded both by natives and foreigners, as the most elegant structure in Europe, if not on the globe\u2026 . No person of taste in architecture or music, who remembers the Pantheon, its exhibitions, its numerous, splendid, and elegant assemblies, can hear it mentioned without a sigh!\"\n\nContemporary reports of the cost of the building were greatly exaggerated. Writing to Sir [[Horace Mann]] in May 1770 Horace Walpole asked \"What do you think of a winter Ranelagh erecting in Oxford Road, at the expense of sixty thousand pounds?\". The courts later determined that the actual cost was \u00a336,965 19s. 5\u00bdd: \u00a327,407 2s. 11\u00bdd for the main construction work, \u00a32,500 for the entrance from Poland Street and \u00a37,058 16s. 6d for furniture, paintings, statues, the organ, and Wyatt's five per cent commission as architect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Patheon Lunardi's Balloon.jpg|thumb|[[Vincenzo Lunardi]]'s balloon exhibited at the Pantheon.]]\n\nThe Pantheon opened on Monday, 27 January 1772. Up to fifty pounds was paid for tickets for the first night which attracted over seventeen hundred members of high society including all the foreign ambassadors and eight dukes and duchesses. Initially the social tone was very high (though a policy that patrons should only be admitted on the recommendation of a peeress was soon dropped), and good profits were made. During the first winter there were assemblies only, without dancing or music, three times a week. In subsequent seasons the entertainments included a mixture of assemblies, masquerades (masked balls) and subscription concerts. For a while the shares commanded high prices and James Wyatt claimed to have sold his two shares for \u00a3900 each.\n\nIn the 1780s the popularity of the Pantheon declined; however, one of the commemoration concerts celebrating the music of the German composer, Handel, was held in the Pantheon in 1784. After the destruction of the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in [[The Haymarket]] by fire in 1789, it was converted into an opera house on a twelve-year lease at \u00a33,000 per annum. James Wyatt was once again the architect. After only one complete season of opera the Pantheon was burnt to the ground in 1792.\n\nBy 1795 the structure had been rebuilt in a similar but not identical form and it was leased as a place of assembly by one Crispus Claggett, who intended to provide masquerades and concerts. The principal room of this reincarnation was not a rotunda but consisted of \"an Area or Pit, \u2026 and a double tier of elegant and spacious Boxes, in the centre of which is a most splendid one for the Royal Family\". The Pantheon reopened with a masquerade on 9 April 1795. The revived assembly rooms were a failure, and in 1796 or 1797 Claggett disappeared and was never heard of again.\n[[File:Pantheon Masquerade edited.jpg|thumb|A masquerade in the rebuilt and modified Pantheon, circa 1808.]]\nFrom 1798 to 1810 the shareholders reverted to the original custom of managing the Pantheon themselves but the popularity of the entertainments continued to decline. In 1811\u201312 [[Nicholas Wilcox Cundy]] converted the building into a theatre, but restrictions imposed by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (then the regulator and censor of theatres) ruined this venture and the career of the Pantheon as a place of public entertainment came to a close in 1814.\n\nIn 1833\u201334, the Pantheon was rebuilt as a [[bazaar]] by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]]. The whole of the roof and part of the walls of the old building were taken down, but the entrance fronts to both Oxford Street and Poland Street were retained, as were also the rooms immediately behind the former. The main space of the new building was a great hall of [[basilica]]n plan, with a [[barrel-vault]]ed [[nave]] of five wide bays. In 1867, the building was acquired by [[Walter Gilbey|W. and A. Gilbey]], [[wine merchant]]s, and was used by them as offices and show rooms until 1937.\n\nIt was demolished shortly afterwards to make way for a branch of [[Marks and Spencer]], opened in 1938, which is still there. This was designed by Robert Lutyens (son of Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]). It has a gleaming art deco polished black granite facade and has become a distinctive landmark on Oxford Street. Its special historic and architectural interest was recognised on 21 September 2009 when the Minister of Culture, Barbara Follett, awarded the building Grade II listed status.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41477 Survey of London] \u2014 detailed architectural history\n\n{{coord|51.5155|-0.1381|type:landmark_region:GB-WSM|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Assembly rooms]]\n[[Category:Dance venues in England]]\n[[Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n[[Category:Former buildings and structures in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Entertainment in London]]\n[[Category:Rotundas in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Domes]]\n[[Category:1772 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1937 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1772]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1937]]\n[[Category:James Wyatt buildings]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Oxford Street]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Pantheon (disambiguation)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Pantheon from Papworth's Select Views 1816.jpg|thumb|The Pantheon in Oxford Street, London.]]\n\n'''The Pantheon''' was a place of public entertainment on the south side of [[Oxford Street]], London, England.

Writing to Sir [[Horace Mann]] in May 1770 Horace Walpole asked \"What do you think of a winter Ranelagh erecting in Oxford Road, at the expense of sixty thousand pounds?\". The courts later determined that the actual cost was \u00a336,965 19s. 5\u00bdd: \u00a327,407 2s. 11\u00bdd for the main construction work, \u00a32,500 for the entrance from Poland Street and \u00a37,058 16s. 6d for furniture, paintings, statues, the organ, and Wyatt's five per cent commission as architect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Patheon Lunardi's Balloon.jpg|thumb|[[Vincenzo Lunardi]]'s balloon exhibited at the Pantheon.]]\n\nThe Pantheon opened on Monday, 27 January 1772. Up to fifty pounds was paid for tickets for the first night which attracted over seventeen hundred members of high society including all the foreign ambassadors and eight dukes and duchesses. Initially the social tone was very high (though a policy that patrons should only be admitted on the recommendation of a peeress was soon dropped), and good profits were made. During the first winter there were assemblies only, without dancing or music, three times a week. In subsequent seasons the entertainments included a mixture of assemblies, masquerades (masked balls) and subscription concerts. For a while the shares commanded high prices and James Wyatt claimed to have sold his two shares for \u00a3900 each.\n\nIn the 1780s the popularity of the Pantheon declined; however, one of the commemoration concerts celebrating the music of the German composer, Handel, was held in the Pantheon in 1784. After the destruction of the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in [[The Haymarket]] by fire in 1789, it was converted into an opera house on a twelve-year lease at \u00a33,000 per annum. James Wyatt was once again the architect. After only one complete season of opera the Pantheon was burnt to the ground in 1792.\n\nBy 1795 the structure had been rebuilt in a similar but not identical form and it was leased as a place of assembly by one Crispus Claggett, who intended to provide masquerades and concerts. The principal room of this reincarnation was not a rotunda but consisted of \"an Area or Pit, \u2026 and a double tier of elegant and spacious Boxes, in the centre of which is a most splendid one for the Royal Family\". The Pantheon reopened with a masquerade on 9 April 1795. The revived assembly rooms were a failure, and in 1796 or 1797 Claggett disappeared and was never heard of again.\n[[File:Pantheon Masquerade edited.jpg|thumb|A masquerade in the rebuilt and modified Pantheon, circa 1808.]]\nFrom 1798 to 1810 the shareholders reverted to the original custom of managing the Pantheon themselves but the popularity of the entertainments continued to decline. In 1811\u201312 [[Nicholas Wilcox Cundy]] converted the building into a theatre, but restrictions imposed by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (then the regulator and censor of theatres) ruined this venture and the career of the Pantheon as a place of public entertainment came to a close in 1814.\n\nIn 1833\u201334, the Pantheon was rebuilt as a [[bazaar]] by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]]. The whole of the roof and part of the walls of the old building were taken down, but the entrance fronts to both Oxford Street and Poland Street were retained, as were also the rooms immediately behind the former. The main space of the new building was a great hall of [[basilica]]n plan, with a [[barrel-vault]]ed [[nave]] of five wide bays. In 1867, the building was acquired by [[Walter Gilbey|W. and A. Gilbey]], [[wine merchant]]s, and was used by them as offices and show rooms until 1937.\n\nIt was demolished shortly afterwards to make way for a branch of [[Marks and Spencer]], opened in 1938, which is still there. This was designed by Robert Lutyens (son of Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]). It has a gleaming art deco polished black granite facade and has become a distinctive landmark on Oxford Street. Its special historic and architectural interest was recognised on 21 September 2009 when the Minister of Culture, Barbara Follett, awarded the building Grade II listed status.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41477 Survey of London] \u2014 detailed architectural history\n\n{{coord|51.5155|-0.1381|type:landmark_region:GB-WSM|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Assembly rooms]]\n[[Category:Dance venues in England]]\n[[Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n[[Category:Former buildings and structures in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Entertainment in London]]\n[[Category:Rotundas in Europe]]\n[[Category:Domes]]\n[[Category:1772 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1937 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1772]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1937]]\n[[Category:James Wyatt buildings]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Oxford Street]]\n", "name_user": "Thoughtfortheday", "label": "safe", "comment": "sub-category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_London"}
