Ladner later went on to found the community of Ladner's Landing, which became the hub of the Municipality of Delta, British Columbia, on November 10, 1879.\n\nOn August 20, 1887, William McKee, the municipal clerk, was designated as a constable in addition to his duties as a clerk. On July 7, 1888, Joseph Jordan was appointed as Delta's first full-time constable, and with this appointment the Delta Municipal Police Department was formed. Over the next eight years Jordan was dismissed and re-appointed several times, depending on the department's needs and was assisted on occasion by other temporary constables.\n\nBy 1900, Jordan had been designated as the chief constable and worked full-time in this role until his retirement in 1911.\n\nThe chief constable's position remained the only regular full-time or part-time position until 1931, when the municipal council authorized the appointment of a night policeman. It was the duty of this policeman, whose salary was partly paid for by the local merchants, to patrol the streets of Ladner at night.\n\nThe 1950s was a decade of growth for the DPD as membership increased to 11 police officers, and the police station began operating on a 24-hour-a-day basis.\n\nBy 1971, the police department had grown to 45 police officers, due to the growth in community population after the opening of the [[George Massey Tunnel]].\n\n==Public Confidence==\nPublic confidence in Delta Police is high, according to the results of a public survey, released by police in March, 2019. Residents are confident in the Delta Police Department\u2019s ability to deliver urgent services, but want officers to be more visible in the community.\n\nRespondents thought the DPD did well in delivering urgent services in a timely manner; dealing with violent crime; having clear and transparent communication through strong social media programs; and consulting with the community to ensure the DPD is meeting their needs and expectations. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northdeltareporter.com/news/confidence-in-delta-police-high-survey/|title=Confidence in Delta police high: survey|date=2019-03-17|website=North Delta Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nSeventy-four per cent of residents give a good to very good rating of officers they had contact with, and 80 per cent of people feel the Delta Police do a good to very good job of delivering urgent services in a timely manner, well above the Canadian average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deltapolice.ca/portfolio-items/public-confident-in-dpds-delivery-of-urgent-services-but-wants-more-police-visibility/|title=Public Confident in DPD Delivery of Urgent Services but Wants More Police Visibility|last=|first=|date=17 April 2020|website=Delta Police|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Recent High Profile Investigations ==\n<br />\n\n=== '''Brother\u2019s Keeper gang arrests''' ===\nIn February 2019, the DPD arrested three people associated with the Brother\u2019s Keepers gang, seizing weapons and \u201ca significant quantity of drugs.\u201d\n\nThe DPD, with the RCMP\u2019s emergency response team and members of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit\u2019s uniformed gang enforcement team, executed a search warrant at a Surrey residence that had been the target of a drug trafficking investigation involving the Brother\u2019s Keepers.\n\nPolice found a loaded firearm, a replica restricted firearm and two bullet proof vests, as well as a significant quantity of suspected heroin and cocaine packaged for sale and a suspected bulk quantity of fentanyl.\n\nThree people inside the residence \u2014 two women and a man \u2014 were arrested without incident and later released, pending charge approval by Crown Counsel.\n\n\u201cTo infiltrate a gang is pretty great work by our drug detectives,\u201d Delta Police Chief Dubord said, noting the arrests highlight the inherent dangers and violence associated with drug trafficking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/2019-a-year-of-successes-and-challenges-for-delta-police/|title=2019 a year of successes and challenges for Delta police|date=2020-01-09|website=Surrey Now-Leader|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Attack on Acting Sergeant John Jasmins''' ===\nIn February 2019, Delta resident Manoj George was arrested after allegedly attacking a woman outside Immaculate Conception School in North Delta.\n\nActing Sgt.
