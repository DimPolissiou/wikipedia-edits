Due to China's historical dominance of East Asian culture, many names used in [[Korean name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]] are adaptations of Chinese names, or have historical roots in Chinese, with appropriate adaptation to accommodate linguistic differences.\n\nModern Chinese names consist of a surname known as '''xing''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng''), which comes first and is usually but [[Chinese compound surname|not always]] monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called '''ming''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u540d}}}}, ''m\u00edng''), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"[[courtesy name]]\" or \"style name\" called '''zi''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'') by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\nFrom at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty]], the [[Han people|Chinese]] observed a number of [[naming taboo]]s regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures\u2014particularly emperors\u2014used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the [[May Fourth Movement]] has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.\n\n==History==\nAlthough some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as ''x\u00ecng'' ({{lang|zh|\u59d3}}) and ''m\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|\u540d}}), are still used today, in ancient times they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during  the [[Zhou dynasty]], members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different names{{mdash}}personal names (''m\u00edng'' {{lang|zh|\u540d}}), clan names (''x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u59d3}}), lineage names (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u6c0f}}), and \"style\" or \"courtesy\" names (''z\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u5b57}}){{mdash}} as well as up to two titles: standard titles (''ju\u00e9'' {{lang|zh|\u7235}}), and posthumous titles (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1}} or ''sh\u00ech\u00e0o'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1\u865f}}).{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}\n\n{{Pre\u2013Qin Chinese names}}\n\nCommoners possessed only a personal name (''ming''), and the modern concept of a \"surname\" or \"family name\" did not yet exist at any level of society.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}  The old lineage (''shi'') and clan names (''xing'') began to become \"family names\" in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]], but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late [[Han dynasty]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=113-115}}\n\n== Family names ==\n{{Main|Chinese surname}}\nAlthough there are currently over 6,000 [[Chinese surname]]s including non-Han Chinese surnames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng'') in use in China,<ref name=gbtimes>{{cite news |url=https://gbtimes.com/wang-is-the-most-common-surname-in-china |title=Wang is the most common surname in China |first= Asa |last=Butcher |date=31 January 2019 |work=GBTimes}}</ref> the colloquial expression for the \"Chinese people\" is  B\u01ceix\u00ecng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u767e\u59d3}}}}) \"[[Hundred Family Surnames|Hundred Surnames]]\", and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China's 1.3 billion citizens.<ref name=\"PD\">{{cite web|website=People's Daily |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200706/19/eng20070619_385661.html |title=Chinese surname shortage sparks rethink |date=19 May 2007 |access-date=16 March 2012}}</ref> In fact, just the top three\u2014[[Wang (surname)|Wang]] ({{lang|zh|\u738b}}), [[Li (\u674e)|Li]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u674e}}}}), and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5f35}})\u2014cover more than 20% of the population.<ref name=\"PD\"/> This homogeneity results from the great majority of [[Han Chinese|Han]] family names having only one character, while the small number of [[Chinese compound surname|compound surnames]] is mostly restricted to minority groups.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.cn/xwzx/jrbd/200712/t20071212_499876.htm |date=12 Dec 2007 |script-title=zh:\u6211\u56fd\u6c49\u65cf\u516c\u6c11\u6700\u957f\u59d3\u540d\u8fbe15\u5b57 \u516c\u5b89\u90e8\uff1a\u8d77\u540d\u4e0d\u89c4\u8303\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u4fbf |website=taiwan.cn |access-date=16 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref>\n\nChinese surnames arose from two separate [[Prehistoric China|prehistoric]] traditions: the ''[[Chinese family name|x\u00ecng]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}) and the ''[[Chinese clan name|sh\u00ec]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6c0f}}}}). The original ''x\u00ecng'' were clans of royalty at the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] court and always included the 'woman' [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5973}}}}. The ''sh\u00ec'' did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59dc}}}}) and [[Yao (surname)|Yao]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59da}}}}) families, the original ''x\u00ecng'' have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. ''X\u00ecng'' is now used to describe the ''sh\u00ec'' surnames which replaced them, while ''sh\u00ec'' is used to refer to [[maiden name]]s.\n\nThe enormous modern clans sometimes share [[tanghao|ancestral halls]] with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u99ac}}}}) includes descendants of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]\u2013era bureaucrat [[Zhao She]], descendants of his subjects in his fief of [[Mafu]], Koreans from an [[Mahan confederacy|unrelated confederation]], and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor [[Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&pg=PA375|title=Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic|author=[[Dru C.

This is still the norm in [[mainland China]], though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of [[greater China]], such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have also adopted the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband's to her own.\n\n== Given names ==\n{{Main|Chinese given name}}\nChinese given names ({{lang|zh|\u540d\u5b57}}, ''m\u00edngzi'') show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables.

Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and [[Chinese tones|tonal qualities]], as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character ''ming'' may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.\n\nToday, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names.<ref name=\"ABC\">Woo Louie, Emma & al.

Accessed 22 Mar 2012.</ref> However, this custom has been consistent only since the [[Ming dynasty]]. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the [[Western Han dynasty|early Han]] and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping [[Wang Mang]] banned all two-character names outright. Although his [[Xin dynasty]] was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> The [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Liao]] between them and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of [[Han people|Han]] dominance under the Ming, promotion of [[Han culture]] under the [[Qing]], and development of [[generation name]]s established the current traditions.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nGiven names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like ''Xi\u01ceo'' or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as [[Li Xiaoping]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life\u2014for example, Daniu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u725b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Bull\") and Dazhu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u67f1}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Pole\")\u2014but such names are becoming less common.\n\nIt is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as \"[[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]]\".<ref>{{cite web |author={{lang|zh|\u6cd5\u5236\u665a\u62a5(\u5317\u4eac)}} Legal Evening News (Beijing) |website=163.com |url=http://news.163.com/07/0815/15/3LUPHGL4000120GU.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd1.8\u4e07\u591a\u4eba\u59d3\u540d\u4e3a\u5218\u7fd4,\u53eb\u5218\u5fb7\u534e\u7684\u4eba\u903e1.6\u4e07 |date=15 October 2007 |access-date=17 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref> Similarly, owing to the traditional [[naming taboo]]s, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a [[generation name]]. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a [[generation poem]]. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of [[Mao Zedong]] read:{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb|\u663e|\u8363|\u671d|\u58eb}}}}\uff0c''Stand tall & display unstintingly before gentlemen,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6587|\u65b9|\u8fd0|\u9645|\u7965}}}}\u3002''And study & method will expand the borders of our fortune''.\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956|\u6069|\u8d3b|\u6cfd|\u8fdc}}}}\uff0c''Ancestral favors bequeath kindness through the ages,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e16|\u4ee3|\u6c38|\u627f|\u660c}}}}\u3002''Descendants forever obliged for their prosperity''.\n\nThis scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5cb8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Lofty\", \"Proud\") instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7389}}}}).<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.</ref>\n\nDepending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u677e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pine\") might have a sister named Mei ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6885}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"[[plum tree|Plum]]\"). In some families, the siblings' names have the same [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. For example, in the Jia ({{lang|zh|\u8d3e}}) clan in ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing Dynasty, there is Zheng ({{lang|zh|\u653f}}), She ({{lang|zh|\u8d66}}), and Min ({{lang|zh|\u654f}}) in the first generation, Lian ({{lang|zh|\u740f}}), Zhen ({{lang|zh|\u73cd}}), and Huan ({{lang|zh|\u73af}}) in the second, and Yun ({{lang|zh|\u82b8}}), Qin ({{lang|zh|\u82b9}}), and Lan ({{lang|zh|\u5170}}({{lang|zh|\u862d}} at the time)) in the third.\n\nMore recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. For example, following the victory of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]], many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5f37|\u570b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6771|\u98a8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on [[Taiwan]], it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"[[Republic of China]]\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef|\u6c11\u570b}}}}, ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3'') into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five element]] practices. In creating a new Chinese name, it is sometimes the practice to analyze the number of strokes in the characters used in the potential name and attempt to use characters that produce specific totals of strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/number-of-stroke-chinese-names-2278472|title=Choosing a Chinese Name by Number of Strokes|author=Qiu Gui Su|date=8 March 2019|accessdate=26 July 2019|quote=The total number of strokes of the zh\u014dng g\u00e9 should equal 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39, 45, 47, 48, 52, 63, 65, 67, 68, 73, or 81.}}</ref>\n\n==Spelling==\n{{Main|Pinyin|Romanization of Chinese}}\nThe process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]].\n\nIn mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,<ref name=\"F&F\">DeFrancis, John. ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]''.</ref> it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of [[Singapore]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[International Organization for Standardization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=13682|title=ISO 7098:1982 \u2013 Documentation \u2013 Romanization of Chinese|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009,<ref name=\"pinyin_tt\">{{cite news | newspaper=Taipei Times |date=2008-09-18 |title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528 |accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"pinyin_cp\">{{cite news |newspaper=The China Post |date=2008-09-18 |title=Government to improve English-friendly environment |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t-to.htm |accessdate=2008-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919054355/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t%2Dto.htm |archive-date=2008-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]]. In Pinyin, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\nProper use of [[Pinyin]] means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, \"{{lang|zh|\u738b\u79c0\u82f1}}\" is properly rendered either with its [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]] as \"W\u00e1ng Xi\u00f9y\u012bng\" or without as \"Wang Xiuying\", but should not be written as \"Wang Xiu Ying\", \"Wang XiuYing\", \"Wangxiuying\", and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: \"[[Sima Qian]]\", not \"Si Ma Qian\" or \"Si Maqian\". However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the ''xing'' and ''ming'' as three words instead of two.\n\nThe switch to Pinyin is still quite new for Taiwan and many non-standard spellings continue to be found, including \"Lee\" and \"Soong\". Similarly, many Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older [[Wade\u2013Giles]] system. This [[English language|English]]-influenced system is identified by its use of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s \"hs\" (for the pinyin ''x'') and \"ts\" (for the pinyin ''z'' and ''c'') and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of multi-character words. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade\u2013Giles, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as [[Mao Tse-tung]], as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as \"Wang<sup>2</sup> Hsiu<sup>4</sup>-Ying<sup>1</sup>\" and \"Ssu<sup>1</sup>Ma<sup>3</sup> Ch'ien<sup>1</sup>\".\n\nPinyin and Wade\u2013Giles both represent the pronunciation of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], based on the [[Beijing dialect]]. In [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and the [[Chinese diaspora|diaspora]] communities in southeast Asia and abroad, the Chinese often romanize according to the sounds of their own local Chinese dialect or lingua franca or language mostly spoken in the area or country they settled into, particularly [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], and [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. In Hong Kong, many Chinese who grew up during British colonial rule adopted English spelling conventions for their names: \"Lee\" for {{lang|zh|\u674e}}, \"Shaw\" for {{lang|zh|\u90b5}}, and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on [[Portuguese orthography]] and [[Jyutping]]. The Chinese from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and the diaspora communities in Malaysia and Singapore fully divide the characters in their names with spaces as a matter of course.\n\nA final point is that\u2014although characters have remained roughly the same since the Han dynasty and some [[Classical Chinese|classical grammar]] is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools\u2014vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from [[Old Chinese|Old]] to [[Middle Chinese|Middle]] to [[Written Vernacular Chinese|Modern Chinese]] even within the [[prestige dialect]]s. Thus, although modern Chinese read \"Confucius\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b54|\u592b\u5b50}}}}) as ''K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0'', the same name would have been ''Khuwng Pjutsi'' in the Tang dynasty and was probably something like an atonal ''Khong\u0294 Pats\u0259\u0294'' during his lifetime.<ref name=\"BaxSag\">Baxter, Wm.

As a result, the upper classes of traditional Chinese culture typically employed a variety of names over the course of their lives, and the [[table of Chinese monarchs|emperors]] and [[ancestor veneration in China|sanctified deceased]] had still others.\n\nCurrent naming practices are more straightforward and consistent, but a few pseudonyms or alternate names remain common.\n\nWhen discussing Chinese writers, Chinese and Japanese scholars do not consistently use particular names, whether they are private names or alternative names.<ref>Chan, Wing-tsit.

The milk name may be abandoned but is often continued as a form of familial nickname. A tradition sometimes attached to the milk name is to select an unpleasant name, in order to ward off demons who might wish to harm the child.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Teresa|title=A World of Baby Names|year=2003|publisher=The Berkeley Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-399-52894-1|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofbabynames00norm_1}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\n[[Nickname]]s ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7dbd\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u7ef0\u53f7}}|p=chu\u00f2h\u00e0o}}, or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5916\u865f}}}}, ''w\u00e0ih\u00e0o'') are acquired in China in much the same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English\u2014such as \"Little Fatty\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f\u80d6}}}})\u2014are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing ''\u0100-'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) or ''Xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}) to the surname or the second character of the given name. ''\u0100-'' is more common in southern China and abroad, while ''Xi\u01ceo'' is common throughout China. Both ''\u0100-'' and ''Xi\u01ceo'' are distinguished from ''L\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8001}}}}, \"old\" but [[#Forms of address|see below]] for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]].\n\n===Western name===\nEnglish is taught throughout China's secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the ''[[Gaokao]]'', China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire Western names, commonly of English origin, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with [[Chinese tones]] and better integration of people working in foreign enterprises. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names taken from nouns are relatively common, such as Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Established English names chosen by Chinese may also be those rarely used by native English speakers.<ref>\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/hong-kong-loves-weird-english-names/263103/</ref> Creative names made and adopted by [[Hongkongers]] are generated by modifying normal English names either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie) or by mimicking the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. [[Hacken Lee]] from Lee Hak-kan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u514b\u52e4}})).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hksarblog.blogspot.com/|title=NOTABLE NAMES (Brilliant Funny Weird Monikers)|website=hksarblog.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, because of its one and a half century [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as attending English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] people of Chinese descent, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among [[Hongkongers]] to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.\n\nIt is also becoming more popular for parents to give their child a middle name in between their given name and family name, similar to many Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===School name===\nThe school name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5b78\u540d}}|s={{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b66\u540d}}|p=xu\u00e9m\u00edng}}}}) was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.\n\nAs [[binomial nomenclature]] is also called ''xu\u00e9m\u00edng'' in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the ''x\u00f9nm\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8a13\u540d}}}}) to avoid confusion.\n\n===Courtesy name===\n{{Main|Courtesy name}}\n\nUpon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a [[courtesy name]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'' or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8868\u5b57}}}}, ''bi\u01ceoz\u00ec'') either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one's given name or displayed his birth order within his family.\n\nThe practice was a consequence of admonitions in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and has been largely abandoned.\n\n===Pseudonym===\n{{Main|Art name}}\n\nPseudonyms or aliases ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u53f7}}|p=h\u00e0o}}) or pen names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7b46\u540d}}|s={{linktext|\u7b14\u540d}}|p=b\u01d0m\u00edng}}) were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.\n\nSome\u2014but by no means most\u2014authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. A noted{{dubious|date=May 2012}} example is the exile and dissident poet [[Zhao Zhenkai]], whose pen name is \"Bei Dao\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5317|\u5c9b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"North Island\").\n\n===Posthumous name===\n{{Main|Posthumous name}}\n\nPosthumous names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u8ae1\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u8c25\u53f7}}|p=sh\u00ech\u00e0o}}) were honorary names selected after a person's death, used extensively for royalty. The common \"names\" of most Chinese emperors before the [[Tang dynasty]]\u2014with the pointed exception of [[Shi Huangdi]]\u2014are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] also occasionally received posthumous titles.\n\n===Temple name===\n{{Main|Temple name}}\n{{See also|Ancestor veneration in China}}\n\nThe temple name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5edf\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u5e99\u53f7}}|p='mi\u00e0oh\u00e0o}}) of the emperor inscribed on the [[spiritual tablet]]s of the [[imperial ancestral temple]] often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either ''z\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956}}}}) or ''z\u014dng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97}}}}). These common \"names\" of the emperors between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] are their temple ones.\n\n===Era name===\n{{Main|Chinese era name|Table of Chinese monarchs}}\n\nThe era name ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e74\u865f}}}}, ''ni\u00e1nh\u00e0o'') arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the practice began of changing [[regnal name]]s as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.\n\n== Forms of address ==\nWithin families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).\n\nThe hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li ({{zh|t=\u674e\u5abd\u5abd|s=\u674e\u5988\u5988|p=l\u01d0 m\u0101ma}}) or Mrs. Zhu ({{lang|zh|\u6731\u592a\u592a}}, {{zh|p=zh\u016b t\u00e0itai}}). Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the west, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person's full name is only two syllables.  It is common to refer to a person as ''l\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}, old) or ''xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f}}, young) followed by their family name, thus L\u01ceo W\u00e1ng ({{lang|zh|\u8001\u738b}}) or Xi\u01ceo Zh\u0101ng ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u5f35, \u5c0f\u5f20}}).  Xi\u01ceo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person's name, rather than the surname.  Note that because old people are well respected in Chinese society, ''l\u01ceo'' (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman.  Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xi\u01ceo-something or l\u01ceo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used.  Otherwise, the use of the person's full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by xi\u0101nsheng ({{zh|c=\u5148\u751f}}, mister) or n\u01dash\u00ec ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5973\u58eb}}, madam) is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.\n\nWithin school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g. elder brother Zhao ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u8d99\u54e5|s=\u8d75\u54e5|p=Zh\u00e0o G\u00e9}}) or e.g. elder sister Zhang ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5f35\u59d0|s=\u5f20\u59d0|p=Zh\u0101ng J\u01d0e}}) if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.\n\nWhereas [[title]]s in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|c=\u674e\u8001\u5e2b|p=L\u01d0 L\u01ceosh\u012b|l=Teacher Li}}), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, \"Teacher Surname\" is considered more respectful than \"Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname\" in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as \"teacher\", though \"professor\" is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as \"Teacher\".\n\nSimilarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word \"engineer\" -- {{zh|c=\u5de5|p=G\u014dng}}. Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title \"z\u014fng\" ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u603b|t=\u7e3d}}), which means \"general\" or \"overall\", and is the first character of titles such as \"Director General\" or \"General Manager\" (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|t=\u674e\u7e3d|s=\u674e\u603b|p=L\u012d z\u014fng}}), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing J\u012bngl\u012d ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u7ecf\u7406|t=\u7d93\u7406}}, manager).\n\n== Variations ==\n\n===Unusual names===\n{{see also|Naming laws in the People's Republic of China}}\nBecause the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the [[Chinese public security bureau]] stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nBeginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nWang Daliang, a [[China Youth University for Political Sciences]] linguistics scholar, said that \"Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Zhou Youyong, the dean of the [[Southeast University]] law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/>\n\nWhile the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/> In addition, [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters]] often results in long names.\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[Han Chinese|Han]] family names in Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]].  [[Indigenous Taiwanese]] have also been forced [[Naming customs of Taiwanese aborigines|to adopt Chinese names]] as part of enforced [[Sinicization]]. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9673}}}}) being particularly more common (about 11% on Taiwan, compared with about 3% on the Mainland). Local variations also exist.\n\nGiven names that consist of one character are much less common on Taiwan than on the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nA traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-s\u00e1i ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6c|\u5c4e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pig Shit\") to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name B\u00f3ng-ch\u012b ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7f54|\u5e02}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"No Takers\").\n\nNicknames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u56dd|\u4ed4|\u540d}}}}, ''g\u00edn-\u00e1-mi\u00e2'', \"child names\") are common and generally adopt the [[nanfangren|Southern Chinese]] practice of affixing the prefix \"A-\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) to the last syllable of a person's name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]] and the singer [[A-mei]].\n\n===Diaspora===\nAmong [[Chinese American]]s, it is common practice to be referred to primarily by the Western name and to use the Chinese given name as an often-omitted [[middle name]].\n\nIn [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]] and [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]], it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the [[President of Singapore|Singaporean President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam|Tony Tan]] might see his name written as \"Tony Tan Keng Yam\" or \"Tan Keng Yam Tony\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Individuals are free to register their [[legal name]]s in either format on their [[National Registration Identity Card|identity card]]s. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the [[Government of Singapore|government]] [[Organisations of the Singapore Government|agencies]] tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma (\"Smith, John\").\n\nThe [[Hong Kong]] printed media tend to adopt the hybrid name style\u2014for example, [[Andy Lau Tak-wah]]\u2014although some people prefer American-style middle names, such as [[Steven N. S. Cheung]], or simply use English names like [[Henry Lee (actor)|Henry Lee]]. On official records such as the Hong Kong [[identity document|Identity Cards]], family names are always printed first in all-caps Latin characters and followed by a comma for all names, including Chinese ones. Thus, the examples above would have identity cards that read \"LAU, Tak-wah Andy\" or \"CHEUNG, Steven Ng-sheong\", with the position of the given names determined at the time of application. Non-Chinese names are printed in similar style: \"DOE, Jane\".\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], one of the country with the most [[Chinese diaspora]] population, the [[Indonesian Chinese]] in Indonesia and in diaspora has mostly adopted [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding Chinese names]] due to centuries of regulation and acculturation. Conversely, the usage of these Indonesian-sounding Chinese names are not restricted for surnames, and many are used liberally between other surnames since many Indonesian Chinese didn't keep track their Chinese (sur)names anymore, and even used by non-Chinese people (with some names being borrowing from regional languages and names).\n\n==In English==\n[[File:Sun Yat Sen Signature.png|thumb|The signature of [[Sun Yat-sen]]; in English Chinese people usually keep their names in Chinese order unless they live or travel abroad]]\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name.

Due to China's historical dominance of East Asian culture, many names used in [[Korean name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]] are adaptations of Chinese names, or have historical roots in Chinese, with appropriate adaptation to accommodate linguistic differences.\n\nModern Chinese names consist of a surname known as '''xing''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng''), which comes first and is usually but [[Chinese compound surname|not always]] monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called '''ming''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u540d}}}}, ''m\u00edng''), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"[[courtesy name]]\" or \"style name\" called '''zi''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'') by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\nFrom at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty]], the [[Han people|Chinese]] observed a number of [[naming taboo]]s regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures\u2014particularly emperors\u2014used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the [[May Fourth Movement]] has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.\n\n==History==\nAlthough some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as ''x\u00ecng'' ({{lang|zh|\u59d3}}) and ''m\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|\u540d}}), are still used today, in ancient times they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during  the [[Zhou dynasty]], members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different names{{mdash}}personal names (''m\u00edng'' {{lang|zh|\u540d}}), clan names (''x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u59d3}}), lineage names (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u6c0f}}), and \"style\" or \"courtesy\" names (''z\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u5b57}}){{mdash}} as well as up to two titles: standard titles (''ju\u00e9'' {{lang|zh|\u7235}}), and posthumous titles (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1}} or ''sh\u00ech\u00e0o'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1\u865f}}).{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}\n\n{{Pre\u2013Qin Chinese names}}\n\nCommoners possessed only a personal name (''ming''), and the modern concept of a \"surname\" or \"family name\" did not yet exist at any level of society.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}  The old lineage (''shi'') and clan names (''xing'') began to become \"family names\" in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]], but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late [[Han dynasty]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=113-115}}\n\n== Family names ==\n{{Main|Chinese surname}}\nAlthough there are currently over 6,000 [[Chinese surname]]s including non-Han Chinese surnames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng'') in use in China,<ref name=gbtimes>{{cite news |url=https://gbtimes.com/wang-is-the-most-common-surname-in-china |title=Wang is the most common surname in China |first= Asa |last=Butcher |date=31 January 2019 |work=GBTimes}}</ref> the colloquial expression for the \"Chinese people\" is  B\u01ceix\u00ecng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u767e\u59d3}}}}) \"[[Hundred Family Surnames|Hundred Surnames]]\", and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China's 1.3 billion citizens.<ref name=\"PD\">{{cite web|website=People's Daily |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200706/19/eng20070619_385661.html |title=Chinese surname shortage sparks rethink |date=19 May 2007 |access-date=16 March 2012}}</ref> In fact, just the top three\u2014[[Wang (surname)|Wang]] ({{lang|zh|\u738b}}), [[Li (\u674e)|Li]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u674e}}}}), and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5f35}})\u2014cover more than 20% of the population.<ref name=\"PD\"/> This homogeneity results from the great majority of [[Han Chinese|Han]] family names having only one character, while the small number of [[Chinese compound surname|compound surnames]] is mostly restricted to minority groups.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.cn/xwzx/jrbd/200712/t20071212_499876.htm |date=12 Dec 2007 |script-title=zh:\u6211\u56fd\u6c49\u65cf\u516c\u6c11\u6700\u957f\u59d3\u540d\u8fbe15\u5b57 \u516c\u5b89\u90e8\uff1a\u8d77\u540d\u4e0d\u89c4\u8303\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u4fbf |website=taiwan.cn |access-date=16 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref>\n\nChinese surnames arose from two separate [[Prehistoric China|prehistoric]] traditions: the ''[[Chinese family name|x\u00ecng]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}) and the ''[[Chinese clan name|sh\u00ec]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6c0f}}}}). The original ''x\u00ecng'' were clans of royalty at the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] court and always included the 'woman' [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5973}}}}. The ''sh\u00ec'' did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59dc}}}}) and [[Yao (surname)|Yao]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59da}}}}) families, the original ''x\u00ecng'' have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. ''X\u00ecng'' is now used to describe the ''sh\u00ec'' surnames which replaced them, while ''sh\u00ec'' is used to refer to [[maiden name]]s.\n\nThe enormous modern clans sometimes share [[tanghao|ancestral halls]] with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u99ac}}}}) includes descendants of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]\u2013era bureaucrat [[Zhao She]], descendants of his subjects in his fief of [[Mafu]], Koreans from an [[Mahan confederacy|unrelated confederation]], and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor [[Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&pg=PA375|title=Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic|author=[[Dru C.

This is still the norm in [[mainland China]], though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of [[greater China]], such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have also adopted the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband's to her own.\n\n== Given names ==\n{{Main|Chinese given name}}\nChinese given names ({{lang|zh|\u540d\u5b57}}, ''m\u00edngzi'') show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables.

Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and [[Chinese tones|tonal qualities]], as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character ''ming'' may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.\n\nToday, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names.<ref name=\"ABC\">Woo Louie, Emma & al.

Accessed 22 Mar 2012.</ref> However, this custom has been consistent only since the [[Ming dynasty]]. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the [[Western Han dynasty|early Han]] and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping [[Wang Mang]] banned all two-character names outright. Although his [[Xin dynasty]] was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> The [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Liao]] between them and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of [[Han people|Han]] dominance under the Ming, promotion of [[Han culture]] under the [[Qing]], and development of [[generation name]]s established the current traditions.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nGiven names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like ''Xi\u01ceo'' or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as [[Li Xiaoping]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life\u2014for example, Daniu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u725b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Bull\") and Dazhu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u67f1}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Pole\")\u2014but such names are becoming less common.\n\nIt is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as \"[[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]]\".<ref>{{cite web |author={{lang|zh|\u6cd5\u5236\u665a\u62a5(\u5317\u4eac)}} Legal Evening News (Beijing) |website=163.com |url=http://news.163.com/07/0815/15/3LUPHGL4000120GU.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd1.8\u4e07\u591a\u4eba\u59d3\u540d\u4e3a\u5218\u7fd4,\u53eb\u5218\u5fb7\u534e\u7684\u4eba\u903e1.6\u4e07 |date=15 October 2007 |access-date=17 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref> Similarly, owing to the traditional [[naming taboo]]s, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a [[generation name]]. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a [[generation poem]]. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of [[Mao Zedong]] read:{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb|\u663e|\u8363|\u671d|\u58eb}}}}\uff0c''Stand tall & display unstintingly before gentlemen,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6587|\u65b9|\u8fd0|\u9645|\u7965}}}}\u3002''And study & method will expand the borders of our fortune''.\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956|\u6069|\u8d3b|\u6cfd|\u8fdc}}}}\uff0c''Ancestral favors bequeath kindness through the ages,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e16|\u4ee3|\u6c38|\u627f|\u660c}}}}\u3002''Descendants forever obliged for their prosperity''.\n\nThis scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5cb8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Lofty\", \"Proud\") instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7389}}}}).<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.</ref>\n\nDepending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u677e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pine\") might have a sister named Mei ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6885}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"[[plum tree|Plum]]\"). In some families, the siblings' names have the same [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. For example, in the Jia ({{lang|zh|\u8d3e}}) clan in ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing Dynasty, there is Zheng ({{lang|zh|\u653f}}), She ({{lang|zh|\u8d66}}), and Min ({{lang|zh|\u654f}}) in the first generation, Lian ({{lang|zh|\u740f}}), Zhen ({{lang|zh|\u73cd}}), and Huan ({{lang|zh|\u73af}}) in the second, and Yun ({{lang|zh|\u82b8}}), Qin ({{lang|zh|\u82b9}}), and Lan ({{lang|zh|\u5170}}({{lang|zh|\u862d}} at the time)) in the third.\n\nMore recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. For example, following the victory of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]], many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5f37|\u570b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6771|\u98a8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on [[Taiwan]], it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"[[Republic of China]]\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef|\u6c11\u570b}}}}, ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3'') into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five element]] practices. In creating a new Chinese name, it is sometimes the practice to analyze the number of strokes in the characters used in the potential name and attempt to use characters that produce specific totals of strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/number-of-stroke-chinese-names-2278472|title=Choosing a Chinese Name by Number of Strokes|author=Qiu Gui Su|date=8 March 2019|accessdate=26 July 2019|quote=The total number of strokes of the zh\u014dng g\u00e9 should equal 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39, 45, 47, 48, 52, 63, 65, 67, 68, 73, or 81.}}</ref>\n\n==Spelling==\n{{Main|Pinyin|Romanization of Chinese}}\nThe process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]].\n\nIn mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,<ref name=\"F&F\">DeFrancis, John.

The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]]. In Pinyin, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\nProper use of [[Pinyin]] means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, \"{{lang|zh|\u738b\u79c0\u82f1}}\" is properly rendered either with its [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]] as \"W\u00e1ng Xi\u00f9y\u012bng\" or without as \"Wang Xiuying\", but should not be written as \"Wang Xiu Ying\", \"Wang XiuYing\", \"Wangxiuying\", and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: \"[[Sima Qian]]\", not \"Si Ma Qian\" or \"Si Maqian\". However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the ''xing'' and ''ming'' as three words instead of two.\n\nThe switch to Pinyin is still quite new for Taiwan and many non-standard spellings continue to be found, including \"Lee\" and \"Soong\". Similarly, many Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older [[Wade\u2013Giles]] system. This [[English language|English]]-influenced system is identified by its use of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s \"hs\" (for the pinyin ''x'') and \"ts\" (for the pinyin ''z'' and ''c'') and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of multi-character words. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade\u2013Giles, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as [[Mao Tse-tung]], as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as \"Wang<sup>2</sup> Hsiu<sup>4</sup>-Ying<sup>1</sup>\" and \"Ssu<sup>1</sup>Ma<sup>3</sup> Ch'ien<sup>1</sup>\".\n\nPinyin and Wade\u2013Giles both represent the pronunciation of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], based on the [[Beijing dialect]]. In [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and the [[Chinese diaspora|diaspora]] communities in southeast Asia and abroad, the Chinese often romanize according to the sounds of their own local Chinese dialect or lingua franca or language mostly spoken in the area or country they settled into, particularly [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], and [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. In Hong Kong, many Chinese who grew up during British colonial rule adopted English spelling conventions for their names: \"Lee\" for {{lang|zh|\u674e}}, \"Shaw\" for {{lang|zh|\u90b5}}, and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on [[Portuguese orthography]] and [[Jyutping]]. The Chinese from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and the diaspora communities in Malaysia and Singapore fully divide the characters in their names with spaces as a matter of course.\n\nA final point is that\u2014although characters have remained roughly the same since the Han dynasty and some [[Classical Chinese|classical grammar]] is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools\u2014vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from [[Old Chinese|Old]] to [[Middle Chinese|Middle]] to [[Written Vernacular Chinese|Modern Chinese]] even within the [[prestige dialect]]s. Thus, although modern Chinese read \"Confucius\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b54|\u592b\u5b50}}}}) as ''K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0'', the same name would have been ''Khuwng Pjutsi'' in the Tang dynasty and was probably something like an atonal ''Khong\u0294 Pats\u0259\u0294'' during his lifetime.<ref name=\"BaxSag\">Baxter, Wm.

The milk name may be abandoned but is often continued as a form of familial nickname. A tradition sometimes attached to the milk name is to select an unpleasant name, in order to ward off demons who might wish to harm the child.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Teresa|title=A World of Baby Names|year=2003|publisher=The Berkeley Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-399-52894-1|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofbabynames00norm_1}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\n[[Nickname]]s ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7dbd\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u7ef0\u53f7}}|p=chu\u00f2h\u00e0o}}, or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5916\u865f}}}}, ''w\u00e0ih\u00e0o'') are acquired in China in much the same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English\u2014such as \"Little Fatty\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f\u80d6}}}})\u2014are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing ''\u0100-'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) or ''Xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}) to the surname or the second character of the given name. ''\u0100-'' is more common in southern China and abroad, while ''Xi\u01ceo'' is common throughout China. Both ''\u0100-'' and ''Xi\u01ceo'' are distinguished from ''L\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8001}}}}, \"old\" but [[#Forms of address|see below]] for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]].\n\n===Western name===\nEnglish is taught throughout China's secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the ''[[Gaokao]]'', China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire Western names, commonly of English origin, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with [[Chinese tones]] and better integration of people working in foreign enterprises. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names taken from nouns are relatively common, such as Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Established English names chosen by Chinese may also be those rarely used by native English speakers.<ref>\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/hong-kong-loves-weird-english-names/263103/</ref> Creative names made and adopted by [[Hongkongers]] are generated by modifying normal English names either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie) or by mimicking the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. [[Hacken Lee]] from Lee Hak-kan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u514b\u52e4}})).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hksarblog.blogspot.com/|title=NOTABLE NAMES (Brilliant Funny Weird Monikers)|website=hksarblog.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, because of its one and a half century [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as attending English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] people of Chinese descent, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among [[Hongkongers]] to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.\n\nIt is also becoming more popular for parents to give their child a middle name in between their given name and family name, similar to many Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===School name===\nThe school name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5b78\u540d}}|s={{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b66\u540d}}|p=xu\u00e9m\u00edng}}}}) was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.\n\nAs [[binomial nomenclature]] is also called ''xu\u00e9m\u00edng'' in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the ''x\u00f9nm\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8a13\u540d}}}}) to avoid confusion.\n\n===Courtesy name===\n{{Main|Courtesy name}}\n\nUpon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a [[courtesy name]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'' or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8868\u5b57}}}}, ''bi\u01ceoz\u00ec'') either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one's given name or displayed his birth order within his family.\n\nThe practice was a consequence of admonitions in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and has been largely abandoned.\n\n===Pseudonym===\n{{Main|Art name}}\n\nPseudonyms or aliases ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u53f7}}|p=h\u00e0o}}) or pen names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7b46\u540d}}|s={{linktext|\u7b14\u540d}}|p=b\u01d0m\u00edng}}) were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.\n\nSome\u2014but by no means most\u2014authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. A noted{{dubious|date=May 2012}} example is the exile and dissident poet [[Zhao Zhenkai]], whose pen name is \"Bei Dao\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5317|\u5c9b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"North Island\").\n\n===Posthumous name===\n{{Main|Posthumous name}}\n\nPosthumous names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u8ae1\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u8c25\u53f7}}|p=sh\u00ech\u00e0o}}) were honorary names selected after a person's death, used extensively for royalty. The common \"names\" of most Chinese emperors before the [[Tang dynasty]]\u2014with the pointed exception of [[Shi Huangdi]]\u2014are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] also occasionally received posthumous titles.\n\n===Temple name===\n{{Main|Temple name}}\n{{See also|Ancestor veneration in China}}\n\nThe temple name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5edf\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u5e99\u53f7}}|p='mi\u00e0oh\u00e0o}}) of the emperor inscribed on the [[spiritual tablet]]s of the [[imperial ancestral temple]] often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either ''z\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956}}}}) or ''z\u014dng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97}}}}). These common \"names\" of the emperors between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] are their temple ones.\n\n===Era name===\n{{Main|Chinese era name|Table of Chinese monarchs}}\n\nThe era name ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e74\u865f}}}}, ''ni\u00e1nh\u00e0o'') arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the practice began of changing [[regnal name]]s as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.\n\n== Forms of address ==\nWithin families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).\n\nThe hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li ({{zh|t=\u674e\u5abd\u5abd|s=\u674e\u5988\u5988|p=l\u01d0 m\u0101ma}}) or Mrs. Zhu ({{lang|zh|\u6731\u592a\u592a}}, {{zh|p=zh\u016b t\u00e0itai}}). Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the west, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person's full name is only two syllables.  It is common to refer to a person as ''l\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}, old) or ''xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f}}, young) followed by their family name, thus L\u01ceo W\u00e1ng ({{lang|zh|\u8001\u738b}}) or Xi\u01ceo Zh\u0101ng ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u5f35, \u5c0f\u5f20}}).  Xi\u01ceo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person's name, rather than the surname.  Note that because old people are well respected in Chinese society, ''l\u01ceo'' (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman.  Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xi\u01ceo-something or l\u01ceo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used.  Otherwise, the use of the person's full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by xi\u0101nsheng ({{zh|c=\u5148\u751f}}, mister) or n\u01dash\u00ec ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5973\u58eb}}, madam) is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.\n\nWithin school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g. elder brother Zhao ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u8d99\u54e5|s=\u8d75\u54e5|p=Zh\u00e0o G\u00e9}}) or e.g. elder sister Zhang ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5f35\u59d0|s=\u5f20\u59d0|p=Zh\u0101ng J\u01d0e}}) if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.\n\nWhereas [[title]]s in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|c=\u674e\u8001\u5e2b|p=L\u01d0 L\u01ceosh\u012b|l=Teacher Li}}), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, \"Teacher Surname\" is considered more respectful than \"Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname\" in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as \"teacher\", though \"professor\" is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as \"Teacher\".\n\nSimilarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word \"engineer\" -- {{zh|c=\u5de5|p=G\u014dng}}. Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title \"z\u014fng\" ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u603b|t=\u7e3d}}), which means \"general\" or \"overall\", and is the first character of titles such as \"Director General\" or \"General Manager\" (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|t=\u674e\u7e3d|s=\u674e\u603b|p=L\u012d z\u014fng}}), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing J\u012bngl\u012d ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u7ecf\u7406|t=\u7d93\u7406}}, manager).\n\n== Variations ==\n\n===Unusual names===\n{{see also|Naming laws in the People's Republic of China}}\nBecause the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the [[Chinese public security bureau]] stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nBeginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nWang Daliang, a [[China Youth University for Political Sciences]] linguistics scholar, said that \"Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Zhou Youyong, the dean of the [[Southeast University]] law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/>\n\nWhile the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/> In addition, [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters]] often results in long names.\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[Han Chinese|Han]] family names in Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]].  [[Indigenous Taiwanese]] have also been forced [[Naming customs of Taiwanese aborigines|to adopt Chinese names]] as part of enforced [[Sinicization]]. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9673}}}}) being particularly more common (about 11% on Taiwan, compared with about 3% on the Mainland). Local variations also exist.\n\nGiven names that consist of one character are much less common on Taiwan than on the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nA traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-s\u00e1i ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6c|\u5c4e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pig Shit\") to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name B\u00f3ng-ch\u012b ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7f54|\u5e02}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"No Takers\").\n\nNicknames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u56dd|\u4ed4|\u540d}}}}, ''g\u00edn-\u00e1-mi\u00e2'', \"child names\") are common and generally adopt the [[nanfangren|Southern Chinese]] practice of affixing the prefix \"A-\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) to the last syllable of a person's name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]] and the singer [[A-mei]].\n\n===Diaspora===\nAmong [[Chinese American]]s, it is common practice to be referred to primarily by the Western name and to use the Chinese given name as an often-omitted [[middle name]].\n\nIn [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]] and [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]], it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the [[President of Singapore|Singaporean President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam|Tony Tan]] might see his name written as \"Tony Tan Keng Yam\" or \"Tan Keng Yam Tony\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Individuals are free to register their [[legal name]]s in either format on their [[National Registration Identity Card|identity card]]s. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the [[Government of Singapore|government]] [[Organisations of the Singapore Government|agencies]] tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma (\"Smith, John\").\n\nThe [[Hong Kong]] printed media tend to adopt the hybrid name style\u2014for example, [[Andy Lau Tak-wah]]\u2014although some people prefer American-style middle names, such as [[Steven N. S. Cheung]], or simply use English names like [[Henry Lee (actor)|Henry Lee]]. On official records such as the Hong Kong [[identity document|Identity Cards]], family names are always printed first in all-caps Latin characters and followed by a comma for all names, including Chinese ones. Thus, the examples above would have identity cards that read \"LAU, Tak-wah Andy\" or \"CHEUNG, Steven Ng-sheong\", with the position of the given names determined at the time of application. Non-Chinese names are printed in similar style: \"DOE, Jane\".\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], one of the country with the most [[Chinese diaspora]] population, the [[Indonesian Chinese]] in Indonesia and in diaspora has mostly adopted [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding Chinese names]] due to centuries of regulation and acculturation. Conversely, the usage of these Indonesian-sounding Chinese names are not restricted for surnames, and many are used liberally between other surnames since many Indonesian Chinese didn't keep track their Chinese (sur)names anymore, and even used by non-Chinese people (with some names being borrowing from regional languages and names).\n\n==In English==\n[[File:Sun Yat Sen Signature.png|thumb|The signature of [[Sun Yat-sen]]; in English Chinese people usually keep their names in Chinese order unless they live or travel abroad]]\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name.

One of the early editors was the French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. Lavoisier, an aristocrat, was [[guillotine]]d in May 1794, ostensibly for tax fraud: and the journal was not published from 1794 to 1796 while the [[Reign of Terror]] was at its height under the [[French Directory]].\n\nIn 1815, it became the ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', and was published under that name for the next 100 years.\n\nIn 1914, it split into two successor journals. The first one, ''[[Annales de physique]]'', was latterly published by [[EDP Sciences]] under the same name up to 2009, when it became integrated in the ''[[European Physical Journal]]'' series as the ''[[European Physical Journal H|European Physical Journal H \u2013 Historical Perspectives on Contemporary Physics]]''.<ref>http://www.annphys.org/</ref> The second successor, ''Annales de chimie'', later became ''[[Annales de chimie: Science des mat\u00e9riaux]]'' in 1978; from 1998 to 2004, it was published online by [[Elsevier]], and since 2004, it has been managed online by the {{ill|\u00c9ditions Lavoisier|fr|}} publishing company.

One of the early editors was the French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. Lavoisier, an aristocrat, was [[guillotine]]d in May 1794, ostensibly for tax fraud: and the journal was not published from 1794 to 1796 while the [[Reign of Terror]] was at its height under the [[French Directory]].\n\nIn 1815, it became the ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', and was published under that name for the next 100 years.\n\nIn 1914, it split into two successor journals. The first one, ''[[Annales de physique]]'', was still being published by [[EDP Sciences]] under the same name up to 2009, when it became integrated in the ''[[European Physical Journal]]'' series as the ''[[European Physical Journal H|European Physical Journal H \u2013 Historical Perspectives on Contemporary Physics]]''.<ref>http://www.annphys.org/</ref> The second successor, ''Annales de chimie'', later became ''[[Annales de chimie: Science des mat\u00e9riaux]]'' in 1978; from 1998 to 2004, it was published online by [[Elsevier]], and since 2004, it has been managed online by the {{ill|\u00c9ditions Lavoisier|fr|}} publishing company. Despite the name changes, the volume numbering maintained continuity between the different titles, both for the physics journal and the chemistry journal.\n\n==Listings==\n* Complete series 1789\u20131913 in downloadable PDF format on Gallica.bnf.fr <small>(select calendar/list for chosen year)</small>\n**[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb343481563/date ''Annales de chimie''] Series 1 (1789\u20131815)\n**[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb343780820/date ''Annales de chimie et de physique''] Series 2\u20138 (1816-1913)\n* Indexes\n**Series 1 (1789\u20131815), 96 issues (''Table G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Raisonn\u00e9e'')\n***[https://archive.org/details/annalesdechimie00morvgoog/page/n7/mode/2up Index to vols. 1-30 (1789-1798)] (pub. 1801) <small>(Archive.org)</small>\n***[https://archive.org/details/annalesdechimie02morvgoog/page/n7/mode/2up Index to vols. 31-60 (1799-1807)] (pub. 1807) <small>(Archive.org)</small>\n***[https://archive.org/details/s3id13207730/page/n4/mode/2up Index to vols. 61-96 (1807-1815)] (pub. 1821) <small>(Archive.org)</small>\n** Series&nbsp;2 (1816\u20131840), 75 issues (''Table G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Raisonn\u00e9e'')\n***[https://archive.org/details/s3id13207990/page/n6/mode/2up Index to vols. 1-30 (1816-1825)] (pub. 1831) <small>(Archive.org) </small>\n***[https://archive.org/details/annalesdechimie110unkngoog/page/n10/mode/2up Index to vols. 31-60 (1826-1835)] (pub. 1840) <small>(Archive.org)</small>\n***[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6570491j/f1.vertical Index to vols. 61-75 (1836-1840)] (pub. 1841) <small>(Gallica)</small>\n** Series&nbsp;3 (1841\u20131863), 69 issues\n***[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062722917&view=1up&seq=11 Index to vols. 1-30 (1841-1850)] (pub.  1851) (''Tables des tomes I a XXX'') <small>(HathiTrust - partner login required for full pdf)</small>\n***[https://archive.org/details/annalesdechimie00chevgoog/page/n9/mode/2up Index to vols. 31-69 (1851-1863)] (pub. 1866) (''Table analytique des mati\u00e8res'') <small>(Archive.org)</small>\n**[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34962k/f2.vertical Index to Series&nbsp;4 (1864\u20131873)], 30 issues (pub. 1874) (''Tables des noms d'auteurs et Table analytique des mati\u00e8res'') <small>(Gallica)</small>\n** [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34963x/f3.vertical Index to Series&nbsp;5 (1874-1883)], 30 issues (pub. 1885) <small>(Gallica)</small>\n** [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k349648/f3.vertical Index to Series&nbsp;6 (1884\u20131893)], 30 issues (pub. 1895) <small>(Gallica)</small>\n** Index to Series&nbsp;7 (1894\u20131903), 30 issues (pub.

{"title_page": "Women in jazz", "text_new": "{{Women in society sidebar |expanded=arts}}\n'''Women in jazz''' have contributed throughout the many eras of [[jazz]] history, both as performers and as composers, songwriters and bandleaders. While women such as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] were famous for their jazz singing, women have achieved much less recognition for their contributions as [[composer]]s, [[bandleader]]s and instrumental performers. Other notable jazz women include piano player [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] and jazz songwriters [[Irene Higginbotham]] and [[Dorothy Fields]].\n\n==History==\n\n===United States===\nWith [[women\u2019s suffrage]] at its peak with the ratification of the United States [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] on 18 August 1920 and the development of the liberated [[flapper]] persona, women began to make a statement within society. In the \"[[Jazz Age]]\", women took a greater part in the workforce after the end of the [[First World War]], giving them more independence. There were many more possibilities for women in terms of social life and entertainment. Ideas such as equality and freer sexuality began to spread and women took on new roles. The 1920s saw the emergence of many famous women musicians including African-American blues singer [[Bessie Smith]] (1894\u20131937), who inspired singers from later eras, including Billie Holiday (1915\u20131959) and [[Janis Joplin]] (1943\u20131970).<ref>Ward, Larry F. \"Bessie\", ''Notes,'' Volume 61, Number 2, December 2004, pp. 458\u2013460 (review). Music Library Association.</ref> In the time of the 1920s, women singing Jazz music was not common but women playing instruments to jazz music was even less common. Mary Lou Williams, known for the talent of playing the piano is deemed as one of the mothers of jazz due to the contributions of the new tones she provided by singing while playing the piano. <ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite web |last1=Howzie |first1=Margaret |title=Jazz Profiles |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/jazzprofiles/archive/women_1.html |website=NPR |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Lovie Austin]] (1887\u20131972) was an piano player and bandleader.

Many musicians began taking the discussion of inequality from the musical aspect and applying those same concepts in becoming an activist. Several women in jazz were activists either for gender equality or racial equality and often times both. Once jazz music transitioned from the 1920s to the \u201950s, many black female artists began singing more in the style of R&B blues as well as folk jazz. [[Nina Simone]] was hailed as setting a prominent precedent for other artists as she modeled what was called the new style of jazz. Her style was also around the time of the popular [[Civil Rights Movement]] that peaked in the late 1950s and continued through the '60s. In 1964, Simone performed at Carnegie Hall in front of an all-white audience. One of the songs she chose to sing was \"[[Mississippi Goddam]]\", which expounded on the racial injustice of blacks living in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bennion |first1=Rob |title=Jazz Music and the Civil Rights Movement |url=http://www.goldstandardmusic.com/blog/2016/11/14/jazz-music-and-the-civil-rights-movement |website=Gold Standard |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref> Although those listening were an all-white audience, many responded with interest and concern rather than criticism which added another layer to the culture of jazz within the civil rights era. Jazz became a unifying concept among contrasting races and cultures and Simone\u2019s popular anthems continued to be a product of the issues surrounding the Civil Rights Movement and the injustices that were displayed.<ref name=\"Hunger\"> {{cite web |last1=Hunger |first1=Max |title=Influential Women in Jazz |url=https://www.dw.com/en/influential-women-in-jazz/g-38796659 |website=DW |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> [[Billie Holiday]] was another prominent female jazz singer who provided an effective notion to the Civil Rights Movement in her song \"[[Strange Fruit]]\".<ref name=\"thoughtcocivil\">{{cite web |last1=Verity |first1=Michael |title=Jazz and the Civil Rights Movement |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/jazz-and-the-civil-rights-movement-2039542 |website=Thought Co. |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>  Through an emotional and metaphorical narration, Holiday's song depicts the vision and harsh reality of blacks being lynched as a result of racism.  Holiday performed the song nearly every night she went on stage, thus shaping the song to become a popular melody.

There were many more possibilities for women in terms of social life and entertainment. Ideas such as equality and freer sexuality began to spread and women took on new roles. The 1920s saw the emergence of many famous women musicians including African-American blues singer [[Bessie Smith]] (1894\u20131937), who inspired singers from later eras, including Billie Holiday (1915\u20131959) and [[Janis Joplin]] (1943\u20131970).<ref>Ward, Larry F. \"Bessie\", ''Notes,'' Volume 61, Number 2, December 2004, pp. 458\u2013460 (review).

Many musicians began taking the discussion of inequality from the musical aspect and applying those same concepts in becoming an activist. Several women in jazz were activists either for gender equality or racial equality and often times both. Once jazz music transitioned from the 1920s to the \u201950s, many black female artists began singing more in the style of R&B blues as well as folk jazz. [[Nina Simone]] was hailed as setting a prominent precedent for other artists as she modeled what was called the new style of jazz. Her style was also around the time of the popular [[Civil Rights Movement]] that peaked in the late 1950s and continued through the '60s. In 1964, Simone performed at Carnegie Hall in front of an all-white audience. One of the songs she chose to sing was \"[[Mississippi Goddam]]\", which expounded on the racial injustice of blacks living in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bennion |first1=Rob |title=Jazz Music and the Civil Rights Movement |url=http://www.goldstandardmusic.com/blog/2016/11/14/jazz-music-and-the-civil-rights-movement |website=Gold Standard |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref> Although those listening were an all-white audience, many responded with interest and concern rather than criticism which added another layer to the culture of jazz within the civil rights era.
