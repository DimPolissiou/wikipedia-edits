Their house is turned upside down when they realize that Raven's son Booker has inherited the same psychic abilities as his mother.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Raven's Home episodes}}\n{{:List of Raven's Home episodes}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as Raven Baxter,<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" /> the single mother of twins Nia and Booker, who works as a fashion designer for dogs and later as a car rental service driver. It is revealed that prior to the series, Raven had gotten divorced from Devon Carter, an ex-boyfriend from high school, and now lives with Chelsea and her son in Chicago. Raven possesses psychic abilities, able to glimpse \"visions\" of the future. She decides not to tell her children about her visions as she believes they would not understand. However, in \"[[List of Raven's Home episodes#ep15|The Falcon and the Raven \u2013 Part Two]]\", she reveals to the children that she is psychic. In the second season, Raven is working as a driver for the transportation business Sc\u00fct. Additionally, she starts working on her own fashion line called \"Ravenous Fashion\".\n* [[Issac Ryan Brown]] as Booker Baxter-Carter,<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" /> Raven's son and Nia's twin brother, who has inherited his mother's psychic abilities. After he gets his first vision at school, he decides not to tell his mother about his psychic abilities as he thinks she would not believe him, unaware that his mother is also psychic. However, in \"[[List of Raven's Home episodes#ep14|The Falcon and the Raven \u2013 Part One]]\", he reveals to his mother that he has visions.\n* Navia Robinson as Nia Baxter-Carter,<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" /> Raven's daughter and Booker's twin sister. She initially does not believe her brother's psychic abilities, insisting it is one of his made up stories. When her brother has a vision of Nia getting hit by a boxing bag that later becomes true, she finally believes him.\n* Jason Maybaum as Levi Grayson,<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" /> Chelsea's son. He is very mature for his age and often acts as the parent in his relationship with his mother.\n*Sky Katz as Tess, the street-wise best friend of Nia who lives in the same building as the rest of the family; her last name is revealed to be O'Malley in \"Oh Father, Where Art Thou?\".\n* [[Anneliese van der Pol]] as Chelsea Grayson,<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" /> Raven's somewhat dim-witted and sweet best friend and the mother of Levi. It is revealed that prior to the series, Chelsea made a substantial sum of money from an infomercial product she invented called the \"Schmop\", but her fortune was stolen by her husband Garrett Grayson. Afterward, Garrett was arrested for tax evasion and ended up having an affair with the federal agent who arrested him. Chelsea subsequently divorced him upon reclaiming some of her money and moved in with Raven. While living with Raven, Chelsea often tries to cook for the family, which goes horribly awry. In season 2, she builds a vegetable garden on their building's rooftop. In the third season, Chelsea is seen temporarily working on a cruise ship she went on during the second season while becoming a life coach.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Jonathan McDaniel]] as Devon Carter, Raven's ex-husband and the father of Booker and Nia who works as a [[meteorologist]].

It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

The song was modified and adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944.

It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

\"Bella ciao\" has also been adopted with adapted lyrics as a worldwide environmental activist song (\"Do it now\"), demanding political action against [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite

[[football chant]] by Italian [[ultras]] groups of [[Cosenza Calcio]], [[A.S.

(sports club)|A.E.K.]], [[Portland Timbers]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], [[Aris Thessaloniki]], [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] and [[FC Z\u00fcrich]] fans.\n\nIn April 2018, supporters from the Portuguese soccer club [[F.C. Porto]] adapted the song with the lyrics \"Penta Xau\" (\"Bye bye fifth\"), referring to the lost opportunity by rival club [[S.L. Benfica]] to win a fifth national championship in a row, a feat only F.C.
