In 2020, Renowned History Changer Moustafa Khan attempted to attribute the paintings origins to Edward Munch. He was later condemned for his actions.\n\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds \"[[Weather lore#Red sky at night|a blood red]]\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a [[fjord]] overlooking Oslo, and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\u2019s commitment at a nearby [[lunatic asylum]].\n\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in [[pastel]]s, as well as a [[lithography|lithograph]] stone from which several prints survive. Both of the painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction.\n\n==Sources of inspiration==\n[[File:Edvard Munch 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Edvard Munch]], 1921]]\nIn his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\n{{quote|One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord\u2014the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red.

The original [[German language|German]] title given by Munch to his work was ''{{lang|de|Der Schrei der Natur}}'' ('''''The Scream of Nature'''''), and the Norwegian title is ''{{lang|no|Skrik}}'' ('''''Shriek'''''). The agonised face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolising the [[angst|anxiety]] of the [[human condition]].\n\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sunlight turned the clouds \"[[Weather lore#Red sky at night|a blood red]]\". He sensed an \"infinite scream passing through nature\". Scholars have located the spot to a [[fjord]] overlooking Oslo, and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\u2019s commitment at a nearby [[lunatic asylum]].\n\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in [[pastel]]s, as well as a [[lithography|lithograph]] stone from which several prints survive. Both of the painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. One of the pastel versions commanded the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at a public auction.\n\n==Sources of inspiration==\n[[File:Edvard Munch 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Edvard Munch]], 1921]]\nIn his diary in an entry headed \"Nice 22 January 1892\", Munch wrote:\n{{quote|One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below.

But there was tension between Gottlieb and NIN frontman [[Trent Reznor]] throughout the promotion. According to Reznor, Gottlieb called Nine Inch Nails' record an \"abortion\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/trent-reznor-rips-collection-shit-called-nine-inch-nails-abortion/|title=Trent Reznor Rips \u2018Collection Of Shit\u2019 Who Called Nine Inch Nails \u2018An Abortion\u2019|first=Brett|last=Buchanan|date=11 July 2017|website=alternativenation.net}}</ref> He said to him: \"You fucked up what could have been a good career.\" When ''Pretty Hate Machine'' sold 1,000,000 copies, Gottlieb reacted rudely, ordering the band to sell 4 million copies of the follow-up. While NIN was on tour, TVT released an EP for the single [[Head Like a Hole|Head Like A Hole]] that was longer in length than the original album, and started underpaying Reznor, along with pressuring him to make a follow-up record that sounded identical to ''Pretty Hate Machine''. Scared that TVT would interfere with his creative control, Reznor, in secret, started recording what would become ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.wiki/TVT_Records|title=TVT Records \u2013 NinWiki|author=|date=|website=www.nin.wiki}}</ref> He met [[Jimmy Iovine]], founder of [[Interscope Records]], and finally, in 1992, Reznor and TVT reached an agreement where NIN would leave TVT and move to Interscope, but TVT would receive some of the royalties made from future NIN releases.\n\nIn 1992, TVT purchased the [[Chicago]]-based [[industrial music]] label [[Wax Trax! Records]]. This gave TVT the artists and/or catalogue releases of such acts as [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]], KMFDM, and others.\n\nIn 1995, TVT started their official soundtrack imprint called TVT SOUNDTRAX headed by Patricia Joseph releasing television, film, and Broadway soundtracks. It expanded \"Television's Greatest Hits\" to an eight-volume series and released over 70 film and TV soundtracks, including the platinum ''[[Mortal Kombat (soundtrack)|Mortal Kombat soundtrack]]''. Its theatrical music releases included the [[Stephen Sondheim]] Follies.\n\nIn 1996 Crain's named Gottlieb one of its forty under 40 Rising Stars to Watch, citing the 50% yearly growth of TVT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/1996/1432 |title=Steve Gottlieb \u2013 1996 \u2013 40 Under Forty &#124; Crain's New York Business |publisher=Mycrains.crainsnewyork.com |accessdate=2012-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922030551/http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/1996/1432 |archivedate=2010-09-22 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 TVT completed a securitization that enabled it to raise $23.5 million in [[growth capital]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/23/business/fi-10759 |work=Los Angeles Times |title=TVT, UCC in $23-Million Financing Deal |first=Chuck |last=Philips |date=1999-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, TVT Records opened TVT Distribution, a distribution company for third party labels, among them [[Vagrant Records]]. TVT Distribution, in conjunction with Vagrant, went on to achieve gold album success with Dashboard Confessional.\n\nThe label's publishing arm, TVT Music Publishing signed songwriter/producers [[Scott Storch]] who won Top Producer of the Year for [[ASCAP]] in 2004, and Lil Jon who won Top Producer of the Year for [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in 2005. Those artists, along with many others, helped TVT Music Publishing accumulate over a hundred US Hot 100 songs, recorded by such acts as [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Justin Timberlake]].\n\n===Later years===\nIn 2000, TVT became the first label to put its entire catalog online available for downloading and free streaming by fans. In 2001, the label reached an amicable arrangement with [[Napster]] for use of TVT's artist copyrights, and TVT's CEO joined the Napster advisory board. Gottlieb appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 on a panel that included [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Richard Parsons]], then head of [[Time Warner]] and Ken Berry, head of [[EMI]], and artists [[Alanis Morissette]] and [[Don Henley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-255228.html |title=Desperado storms Capitol Hill \u2013 CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2001-04-03 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref> CEO Gottlieb served on the Board of Directors of [[Musicmatch Jukebox|Musicmatch]] (sold to [[Yahoo!]]).\n\nTVT was one of the founding members of the [[Association of Independent Music]] (A2IM), an organization devoted to protecting independent labels' interests.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1112843,00.html |work=Time |title=Biz Briefs: Fighting For the Little Guy |date=2005-10-02 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the label got into a dispute with [[Lyor Cohen]], then head of [[Island Def Jam]]. The dispute involved Cohen and Universal paying former TVT artist Ja Rule $8 million to not deliver an album paid for by TVT, and promised to TVT and instead deliver it to [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]. In the resulting litigation Universal was prohibited by the courts from releasing the album created with TVT's funding. In the ultimate trial over the claims of fraud and tortious interference, a jury awarded TVT a $132 million judgment. Universal appealed the ruling. On appeal, Cohen and Universal argued the existence of an agreement between the parties meant that their behavior was only a breach of contract and not a fraud or tort. The court agreed, reducing TVT's award to $126,000.\n\n====Slip-N-Slide lawsuit/Bankruptcy====\nIn 2007, TVT lost a $9 million lawsuit to [[Slip-N-Slide Records]] when a [[Florida]] judge ruled that Slip-N-Slide had legal rights to distribute an unreleased album it owned by rapper Pitbull that he recorded for Slip-N-Slide in 2001. TVT, who signed Pitbull several years later, had sought to notice third parties (such as record stores or digital download entities) that the distribution and sale of this album would violate TVT's exclusive right to create new music by the artist.

Its biggest commercial successes were the triple platinum Nine Inch Nails's ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'', two double platinum releases by Lil Jon, and platinum releases by [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Tha Eastsidaz]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], [[Default (band)|Default]] and [[Ying Yang Twins]] as well as gold releases by [[Sevendust]], [[Gravity Kills (album)|Gravity Kill]]s and [[Live at the Greek|The Black Crowes and Jimmy Page]]. Additionally, TVT also had success overseas, achieving a gold release in Germany and Sweden with [['74\u2013'75|The Connells]] and scored platinum and gold records in Canada with [[The Fallout (Default album)|Default]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nTeeVee Toons was founded in 1978 by [[Steve Gottlieb]], a graduate of [[Yale]] University and [[Harvard]] Law.<ref name=time>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1074976-2,00.html |title=Business Notes |date=20 January 1986 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=2 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> Gottlieb launched the label from his [[New York City]] apartment<ref name=time /> with the release of ''[[Television's Greatest Hits]]'', an album featuring theme songs from classic TV shows that became a respectable seller. The [[San Francisco Chronicle]] called the album \"the most fun you can have with your pants on\", and the ''[[New York Times]]'' highlighted it as one of 1985's most notable business ideas.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/29/business/whoever-dreamed-that-up.html?&pagewanted=3 |work=The New York Times |title=Whoever Dreamed That Up? |first=Robert A. |last=Bennett |date=1985-12-29 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, TeeVee Toons was shortened to TVT Records, a label that would sign and/or develop musical acts over the next couple of decades such as: [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]], [[Shona Laing]], Nine Inch Nails, [[The Connells]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Tackhead]], Underworld, [[Gravity Kills]], [[Vallejo (band)|Vallejo]], [[Jurassic Five]], [[Sevendust]], [[Default (band)|Default]], [[XTC]], [[Guided By Voices]], [[Jimmy Page]] and [[The Black Crowes]], [[Bounty Killer]], [[KMFDM]], Brian Jonestown Massacre, [[The Holloways]], [[The Cinematics]], [[Towers of London (band)|Towers of London]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], [[Tha Eastsidaz]], [[Just Jack]], Wayne, [[Pay the Girl]], [[Buck-O-Nine]], [[New Years Day (band)|New Years Day]], [[Le Futur Noir|The Strays]], Blue Epic,  [[Lil Jon]], Ying Yang Twins, Pitbull, [[Teedra Moses]], [[The Unband]], and [[Ambulance LTD]].\n\nIn 1988\u201389, TVT signed [[industrial rock]] band [[Nine Inch Nails]], and they released their debut studio album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' on October 20, 1989. But there was tension between Gottlieb and NIN frontman [[Trent Reznor]] throughout the promotion. According to Reznor, Gottlieb called Nine Inch Nails' record an \"abortion\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/trent-reznor-rips-collection-shit-called-nine-inch-nails-abortion/|title=Trent Reznor Rips \u2018Collection Of Shit\u2019 Who Called Nine Inch Nails \u2018An Abortion\u2019|first=Brett|last=Buchanan|date=11 July 2017|website=alternativenation.net}}</ref> He said to him: \"You fucked up what could have been a good career.\" When ''Pretty Hate Machine'' sold 1,000,000 copies, Gottlieb reacted rudely, ordering the band to sell 4 million copies of the follow-up. While NIN was on tour, TVT released an EP for the single [[Head Like a Hole|Head Like A Hole]] that was longer in length than the original album, and started underpaying Reznor, along with pressuring him to make a follow-up record that sounded identical to ''Pretty Hate Machine''. Scared that TVT would interfere with his creative control, Reznor, in secret, started recording what would become ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.wiki/TVT_Records|title=TVT Records \u2013 NinWiki|author=|date=|website=www.nin.wiki}}</ref> He met [[Jimmy Iovine]], founder of [[Interscope Records]], and finally, in 1992, Reznor and TVT reached an agreement where NIN would leave TVT and move to Interscope, but TVT would receive some of the royalties made from future NIN releases.\n\nIn 1992, TVT purchased the [[Chicago]]-based [[industrial music]] label [[Wax Trax! Records]]. This gave TVT the artists and/or catalogue releases of such acts as [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]], KMFDM, and others.\n\nIn 1995, TVT started their official soundtrack imprint called TVT SOUNDTRAX headed by Patricia Joseph releasing television, film, and Broadway soundtracks. It expanded \"Television's Greatest Hits\" to an eight-volume series and released over 70 film and TV soundtracks, including the platinum ''[[Mortal Kombat (soundtrack)|Mortal Kombat soundtrack]]''. Its theatrical music releases included the [[Stephen Sondheim]] Follies.\n\nIn 1996 Crain's named Gottlieb one of its forty under 40 Rising Stars to Watch, citing the 50% yearly growth of TVT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/1996/1432 |title=Steve Gottlieb \u2013 1996 \u2013 40 Under Forty &#124; Crain's New York Business |publisher=Mycrains.crainsnewyork.com |accessdate=2012-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922030551/http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/1996/1432 |archivedate=2010-09-22 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 TVT completed a securitization that enabled it to raise $23.5 million in [[growth capital]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/23/business/fi-10759 |work=Los Angeles Times |title=TVT, UCC in $23-Million Financing Deal |first=Chuck |last=Philips |date=1999-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, TVT Records opened TVT Distribution, a distribution company for third party labels, among them [[Vagrant Records]]. TVT Distribution, in conjunction with Vagrant, went on to achieve gold album success with Dashboard Confessional.\n\nThe label's publishing arm, TVT Music Publishing signed songwriter/producers [[Scott Storch]] who won Top Producer of the Year for [[ASCAP]] in 2004, and Lil Jon who won Top Producer of the Year for [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in 2005. Those artists, along with many others, helped TVT Music Publishing accumulate over a hundred US Hot 100 songs, recorded by such acts as [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Justin Timberlake]].\n\n===Later years===\nIn 2000, TVT became the first label to put its entire catalog online available for downloading and free streaming by fans. In 2001, the label reached an amicable arrangement with [[Napster]] for use of TVT's artist copyrights, and TVT's CEO joined the Napster advisory board. Gottlieb appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 on a panel that included [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Richard Parsons]], then head of [[Time Warner]] and Ken Berry, head of [[EMI]], and artists [[Alanis Morissette]] and [[Don Henley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-255228.html |title=Desperado storms Capitol Hill \u2013 CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2001-04-03 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}</ref> CEO Gottlieb served on the Board of Directors of [[Musicmatch Jukebox|Musicmatch]] (sold to [[Yahoo!]]).\n\nTVT was one of the founding members of the [[Association of Independent Music]] (A2IM), an organization devoted to protecting independent labels' interests.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1112843,00.html |work=Time |title=Biz Briefs: Fighting For the Little Guy |date=2005-10-02 |accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the label got into a dispute with [[Lyor Cohen]], then head of [[Island Def Jam]]. The dispute involved Cohen and Universal paying former TVT artist Ja Rule $8 million to not deliver an album paid for by TVT, and promised to TVT and instead deliver it to [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]. In the resulting litigation Universal was prohibited by the courts from releasing the album created with TVT's funding. In the ultimate trial over the claims of fraud and tortious interference, a jury awarded TVT a $132 million judgment. Universal appealed the ruling. On appeal, Cohen and Universal argued the existence of an agreement between the parties meant that their behavior was only a breach of contract and not a fraud or tort. The court agreed, reducing TVT's award to $126,000.\n\n====Slip-N-Slide lawsuit/Bankruptcy====\nIn 2007, TVT lost a $9 million lawsuit to [[Slip-N-Slide Records]] when a [[Florida]] judge ruled that Slip-N-Slide had legal rights to distribute an unreleased album it owned by rapper Pitbull that he recorded for Slip-N-Slide in 2001. TVT, who signed Pitbull several years later, had sought to notice third parties (such as record stores or digital download entities) that the distribution and sale of this album would violate TVT's exclusive right to create new music by the artist. The judge, however, ruled against TVT as Pitbull had made the recordings prior to signing with TVT, and awarded Slip-N-Slide the $9 million judgement as TVT had attempted to block the sale of the album. TVT filed for appeal but was unable to post the required bond, thus TVT filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOn February 19, 2008, Gottlieb stated \"This is not the end of TVT.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN1930049520080219 | title=Music label TVT Records to file for bankruptcy |date=2008-02-19 |work=Reuters}}</ref> In June 2008, however, the digital music label [[The Orchard (music label)|The Orchard]] was declared the winning bidder by a [[New York (state)|New York]] bankruptcy court and gained control of TVT's artist contracts, catalogue recordings, and its distribution infrastructure, thus ending the TVT Records label imprint.

The pressure on Taylor increased as U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] twice that month stated that Taylor \"must leave Liberia\". On 9 July, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] offered Taylor [[exile]] in his country on the condition that Taylor stay out of Liberian politics.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/09/liberia/ | title=Nigeria would shield Taylor from trial|publisher=CNN|date=10 July 2003 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTaylor insisted that he would resign only if U.S. [[peacekeeping]] troops were deployed to Liberia.

He harshly criticized the United States in his [[farewell address]], saying that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s insistence that he leave the country would hurt Liberia.<ref name=\"allafricatheend\" /> On 11 August, Taylor resigned, with Blah serving as president until a transitional government was established on 14 October. [[Ghana]]ian President [[John Kufuor]], South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]], and [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] President [[Joaquim Chissano]], all representing African regional councils, were present at his announcement. The U.S. brought [[Joint Task Force Liberia]]'s [[Amphibious Ready Group]] of three warships with 2,300 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] into view of the coast. Taylor flew to Nigeria, where the Nigerian government provided houses for him and his entourage in [[Calabar]].\n\n==Exile==\nIn November 2003, the [[United States Congress]] passed a bill that included a reward offer of two million dollars for Taylor's capture. While the peace agreement had guaranteed Taylor safe exile in Nigeria, it also required that he refrain from influencing Liberian politics. His critics said he disregarded this prohibition.  On 4 December, [[Interpol]] issued a [[red notice]] regarding Taylor, suggesting that countries had a duty to arrest him. Taylor was placed on Interpol's [[Most Wanted list]], declaring him wanted for [[crimes against humanity]] and breaches of the 1949 [[Fourth Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention]], and noting that he should be considered dangerous. Nigeria stated it would not submit to Interpol's demands, agreeing to deliver Taylor to Liberia only in the event that the President of Liberia requested his return.\n\nOn 17 March 2006, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], the newly elected President of Liberia, submitted an official request to Nigeria for Taylor's [[extradition]]. This request was granted on 25 March, whereby Nigeria agreed to release Taylor to stand trial in the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL). Nigeria agreed only to release Taylor and not to extradite him, as no [[extradition treaty]] existed between the two countries.\n\n===Disappearance and arrest===\nThree days after Nigeria announced its intent to transfer Taylor to Liberia, the leader disappeared from the seaside villa where he had been living in exile.<ref>{{cite news| author=Polgreen, Lydia| title=Nigeria Says Ex-President of Liberia Has Disappeared| journal=The New York Times| date=29 March 2006| url=https://nytimes.com/2006/03/29/international/africa/29liberia.html}}</ref> A week before that, Nigerian authorities had taken the unusual step of allowing local press to accompany census takers into Taylor\u2019s Calabar compound.\n\nNigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] was scheduled to meet with President Bush less than 48 hours after Taylor was reported missing. Speculation ensued that Bush would refuse to meet with Obasanjo if Taylor were not apprehended. Less than 12 hours prior to the scheduled meeting between the two heads of state, Taylor was reported apprehended en route to Liberia.\n\nOn 29 March, Taylor tried to cross the border into [[Cameroon]] through the border town of Gamboru in northeastern Nigeria. His [[Range Rover]] with Nigerian diplomatic plates was stopped by border guards, and Taylor's identity was eventually established. [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] staff later reported that significant amounts of cash and heroin were found in the vehicle.\n\nUpon his arrival at [[Roberts International Airport]] in [[Harbel]], Liberia, Taylor was arrested and handcuffed by LNP officers, who immediately transferred responsibility for the custody of Taylor to the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL). Irish UNMIL soldiers escorted Taylor aboard a UN helicopter to [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone, where he was delivered to the SCSL.\n\n==Trial==\n[[File:Monrovia news board 2008.jpeg|thumb|Newsboard documenting the Charles Taylor case]]\nThe SCSL prosecutor originally indicted Taylor on 3 March 2003 on a 17-counts for [[war crimes]] and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in Sierra Leone.

The pressure on Taylor increased as U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] twice that month stated that Taylor \"must leave Liberia\". On 9 July, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] offered Taylor [[exile]] in his country on the condition that Taylor stay out of Liberian politics.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/09/liberia/ | title=Nigeria would shield Taylor from trial|publisher=CNN|date=10 July 2003 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTaylor insisted that he would resign only if U.S. [[peacekeeping]] troops were deployed to Liberia.

He harshly criticized the United States in his [[farewell address]], saying that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s insistence that he leave the country would hurt Liberia.<ref name=\"allafricatheend\" /> On 11 August, Taylor resigned, with Blah serving as president until a transitional government was established on 14 October. [[Ghana]]ian President [[John Kufuor]], South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]], and [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] President [[Joaquim Chissano]], all representing African regional councils, were present at his announcement. The U.S. brought [[Joint Task Force Liberia]]'s [[Amphibious Ready Group]] of three warships with 2,300 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] into view of the coast. Taylor flew to Nigeria, where the Nigerian government provided houses for him and his entourage in [[Calabar]].\n\n==Exile==\nIn November 2003, the [[United States Congress]] passed a bill that included a reward offer of two million dollars for Taylor's capture. While the peace agreement had guaranteed Taylor safe exile in Nigeria, it also required that he refrain from influencing Liberian politics. His critics said he disregarded this prohibition.  On 4 December, [[Interpol]] issued a [[red notice]] regarding Taylor, suggesting that countries had a duty to arrest him. Taylor was placed on Interpol's [[Most Wanted list]], declaring him wanted for [[crimes against humanity]] and breaches of the 1949 [[Fourth Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention]], and noting that he should be considered dangerous. Nigeria stated it would not submit to Interpol's demands, agreeing to deliver Taylor to Liberia only in the event that the President of Liberia requested his return.\n\nOn 17 March 2006, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], the newly elected President of Liberia, submitted an official request to Nigeria for Taylor's [[extradition]]. This request was granted on 25 March, whereby Nigeria agreed to release Taylor to stand trial in the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL). Nigeria agreed only to release Taylor and not to extradite him, as no [[extradition treaty]] existed between the two countries.\n\n===Disappearance and arrest===\nThree days after Nigeria announced its intent to transfer Taylor to Liberia, the leader disappeared from the seaside villa where he had been living in exile.<ref>{{cite news| author=Polgreen, Lydia| title=Nigeria Says Ex-President of Liberia Has Disappeared| journal=The New York Times| date=29 March 2006| url=https://nytimes.com/2006/03/29/international/africa/29liberia.html}}</ref> A week before that, Nigerian authorities had taken the unusual step of allowing local press to accompany census takers into Taylor\u2019s Calabar compound.\n\nNigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] was scheduled to meet with President Bush less than 48 hours after Taylor was reported missing. Speculation ensued that Bush would refuse to meet with Obasanjo if Taylor were not apprehended. Less than 12 hours prior to the scheduled meeting between the two heads of state, Taylor was reported apprehended en route to Liberia.\n\nOn 29 March, Taylor tried to cross the border into [[Cameroon]] through the border town of Gamboru in northeastern Nigeria. His [[Range Rover]] with Nigerian diplomatic plates was stopped by border guards, and Taylor's identity was eventually established. [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] staff later reported that significant amounts of cash and heroin were found in the vehicle.\n\nUpon his arrival at [[Roberts International Airport]] in [[Harbel]], Liberia, Taylor was arrested and handcuffed by LNP officers, who immediately transferred responsibility for the custody of Taylor to the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL). Irish UNMIL soldiers escorted Taylor aboard a UN helicopter to [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone, where he was delivered to the SCSL.\n\n==Trial==\n[[File:Monrovia news board 2008.jpeg|thumb|Newsboard documenting the Charles Taylor case]]\nThe SCSL prosecutor originally indicted Taylor on 3 March 2003 on a 17-counts for [[war crimes]] and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in Sierra Leone. On 16 March 2006, a SCSL judge gave leave to amend the indictment against Taylor. Under the amended indictment, Taylor was charged with 11 counts.
