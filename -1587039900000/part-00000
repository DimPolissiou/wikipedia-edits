This explains her practical and quick approach to cooking. Also, Villapol's cooking show was only sponsored by the Cuban government after the Revolution, which means she had scarce food products to work with, just like most Cubans at the time. Villapol published a second version of ''Cocina al Minuto'' (1991) to help teach her readers how to make do with the scarce availability of food in the market. In general, her interest in culinary was for educational purposes, in order to pass on important information about cooking to the Cuban population and help improve their health.

He would later take on the responsibilities of running his uncle's store in [[Port Leon, Florida]]. Ladd moved to [[Newport, Wakulla County, Florida|Newport]] after the 1843 [[hurricane]]. \n\nAs Newport grew, Ladd's business grew as well with him adding a large [[sawmill]], [[foundry]], two hotels and [[turpentine]] works to the town. He was a major proponent and President of the [[Georgia-Florida Plank Road Company]]. \n\nHaving a growing business, Ladd purchased a [[paddle wheel|side-paddle wheel]] steamer in 1850 which was named the ''[[CSS Spray|Spray]]''. The ''Spray'' operated as far south as [[Cedar Key, Florida]], up the [[Apalachicola River]] to [[Columbus, Georgia]], up the [[Suwannee River]] and west to [[New Orleans]] transporting cotton, naval stores, hides, tobacco, beeswax.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two lucky passengers, along with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organised by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.

In 2001, the Naidu Government declared the creation of Cyberabad Development Authority (CDA) as a special enclave for the location of IT firms; research institutions and allied services around the existing \u2018HITEC City\u2019 area in Hyderabad. In conjunction with the name Hyderabad, this new cyber enclave has been named \u2018Cyberabad\u2019.

The master plan of the CDA was characterised by mixed land-use with more than 25% of the total land area for residential purposes and more than 32% for software industries. Along with residential and software industries, the CDA includes Indian School of Business, University of Hyderabad, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, a sports complex and a golf course. The creation of the CDA paved the way for the development of special enclaves meant for special purposes.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two lucky passengers, along with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organised by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.
