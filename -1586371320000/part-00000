From there, it continued to [[Deanwood]] on the [[Washington Railway and Electric Company]]'s [[Seat Pleasant Line]], running parallel to the Chesapeake Beach Railroad tracks and across the [[Benning Road Bridge]] into downtown Washington.\n\nOnce onto their own right-of-way, the WB&A's expresses regularly hit 60&nbsp;mph, but street running in the terminal cities slowed their overall time. A typical B&O express made the trip in 50 minutes, but the best the WB&A could do was an hour and 20 minutes.  Offsetting these handicaps were its cleanliness, lower fares, half-hourly express service, and better-located downtown terminals.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/>\n\n=== Business Along the Route ===\n[[File:WB&A excursion train 1910.jpg|thumb|left|6-car excursion extra departing Annapolis for Washington in 1910]]\nAlways looking for new sources of business, the railroad, in 1914, convinced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Fair Association to establish [[Bowie Race Track]] along the Main Line.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/>\n\nIn September 1917, as the U.S. entered [[World War I]], George Bishop, the WB&A's well-connected president, persuaded the [[U.S. Army]] to acquire land owned by the railroad and open a training facility.  [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]] was established in the area roughly bounded by the B&O Washington Branch on the west, the Pennsylvania Railroad on the east, and the South Shore Line of the WB&A to the south.  The installation was supposed to be a temporary facility, used only for the duration of the war (it is still in use today).  The WB&A saw record traffic during this time as a result of freight and passenger service to the camp.  In 1918, the railroad was running as many as 84 special trains a day.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nWith the business seemingly successful, the WB&A purchased the [[Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line]] in 1921.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/> It became known as the ''\"North Shore Line\"'' and the [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] to [[Odenton, Maryland|Odenton]] line as the ''\"South Shore Line\"''.  At this time, the B&A gave up its terminus at the [[Camden Yards station|Camden Street Station]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and started using the WB&A terminal on Liberty Street (between Lexington and Fayette) in Baltimore.  Prior to 1921 the WB&A and B&A had run on separate, parallel tracks from Linthicum to Baltimore.  But on March 16, 1921, a crossover connected the two parallel tracks at [[Linthicum, Maryland|Linthicum]] operations ceased on the B. & O. track, and a new terminal was built at the southwest corner of South Howard and West Lombard Streets (current site after the early 1970s of Holiday Inn hotel) across from the [[Baltimore Civic Center]] (1st Mariner Arena).<ref>{{cite  web|author=Herbert H.

The railroad only survived because of a law exempting it from taxes.  In January 1931, during the [[Great Depression]], the extension of the law failed to pass by one vote and the line went into receivership.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&court=us&vol=289&invol=36| title= Williams v.

It branches off of [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] [[Northeast Corridor]] just south of [[Maryland Route 175|MD 175/Annapolis Road]] and travels east past the Odenton Library and across [[Maryland Route 170|MD 170/Piney Orchard Parkway]] at grade before turning north to cross Annapolis Road, also at-grade. It then travels a short distance north to the site of the old Nevamar Company's manufacturing plant. That plant shut down in 2004 and trains haven't run on the spur since. \n* At the northeast corner of the location where the track listed above crosses MD 170 (Telegraph Road) is a brick building that once housed the WB&A operations headquarters. The Baltimore-Washington main line and Fort Meade-Annapolis (South Shore) branch crossed at this location, known as \"Naval Academy Junction.\" The interlocking tower that controlled this crossing comprised the second floor. Commercial office tenants occupy the building today.\n* The \"Naval Academy Junction\" shops sat about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} north of \"Naval Academy Junction,\" on the east side of MD 170. The brick shop buildings were subsumed into a larger building complex that housed a number of manufacturing companies, including Nevamar Plastics, but those shops were torn down in 2013.

(A nearby rail trail signed \"WB&A Spur Trail\" branches off of the WB&A Trail and was built on a route that once served the race track, but the route was actually constructed subsequent to the WB&A's demise, by the Pennsylvania Railroad.).\n* [[Maryland Route 704|MD 704]] was built on the right-of-way.\n* A [[freight motor]], Washington Baltimore & Annapolis #1, is maintained at the [[Western Railway Museum]] in [[Rio Vista, California]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book| author=Merriken, John E.| year=1993| title=Every Hour On The Hour; A Chronicle of the Washington, Baltimore & Annapolis Electric Railroad| publisher=Taylor Publishing Company| isbn=0-9600938-3-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Attached KML}}\n*[http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/b&a_trail.html Baltimore & Annapolis Trail Park]\n*[http://www.borail.org/ Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum]\n*[http://www.aacounty.org/RecParks/parks/trails/wbandatrailpark.cfm Anne Arundel County portion of the WB&A Trail]\n*[http://www.pgparks.com/Your_Parks/Trails/Washington__Baltimore___Annapolis_htm.htm Prince George's County portion of the WB&A Trail]\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/oldmainline/wasaer1.htm Modern-day photo tour of South Shore Line]\n*[http://www.newdavesrailpix.com/odds/md/md.htm#wba Photos of the rolling stock]\n*[http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/photos/cfm/dsp_unit.cfm?id=61675 Photo of Car in Annapolis]\n\n{{US railroad lists}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Washington Baltimore Annapolis Electric Railway}}\n[[Category:Defunct Maryland railroads]]\n[[Category:Defunct Washington, D.C., railroads]]\n[[Category:Street railways in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Interurban railways in Maryland]]\n[[Category:Interurban railways in Washington, D.C.]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rail|\nrailroad_name=Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway|\nlogo_filename=WBAlogo.png|\nlogo_size=104|\nsystem_map=Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad line map.jpg|\nmap_size=300|\nmap_caption=WB&A System map|\nold_gauge=|\nmarks=WB&A|\nlocale=[[Maryland]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]|\nstart_year=1908|\nend_year=1935|\nsuccessor_line=abandoned|\ngauge={{Track gauge|4ft8.5in|allk=on}} |\nhq_city=[[Annapolis, Maryland]]}}\n\nThe '''Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway''' (WB&A) was an [[United States|American]] [[railroad]] of central [[Maryland]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], built in the 19th and 20th century.

Offsetting these handicaps were its cleanliness, lower fares, half-hourly express service, and better-located downtown terminals.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/>\n\n=== Business Along the Route ===\n[[File:WB&A excursion train 1910.jpg|thumb|left|6-car excursion extra departing Annapolis for Washington in 1910]]\nAlways looking for new sources of business, the railroad, in 1914, convinced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Fair Association to establish [[Bowie Race Track]] along the Main Line.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/>\n\nIn September 1917, as the U.S. entered [[World War I]], George Bishop, the WB&A's well-connected president, persuaded the [[U.S. Army]] to acquire land owned by the railroad and open a training facility.  [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]] was established in the area roughly bounded by the B&O Washington Branch on the west, the Pennsylvania Railroad on the east, and the South Shore Line of the WB&A to the south.  The installation was supposed to be a temporary facility, used only for the duration of the war (it is still in use today).  The WB&A saw record traffic during this time as a result of freight and passenger service to the camp.  In 1918, the railroad was running as many as 84 special trains a day.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nWith the business seemingly successful, the WB&A purchased the [[Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line]] in 1921.<ref name=\"mdoe\"/> It became known as the ''\"North Shore Line\"'' and the [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] to [[Odenton, Maryland|Odenton]] line as the ''\"South Shore Line\"''.  At this time, the B&A gave up its terminus at the [[Camden Yards station|Camden Street Station]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and started using the WB&A terminal on Liberty Street (between Lexington and Fayette) in Baltimore.  Prior to 1921 the WB&A and B&A had run on separate, parallel tracks from Linthicum to Baltimore.  But on March 16, 1921, a crossover connected the two parallel tracks at [[Linthicum, Maryland|Linthicum]] operations ceased on the B. & O. track, and a new terminal was built at the southwest corner of South Howard and West Lombard Streets (current site after the early 1970s of Holiday Inn hotel) across from the [[Baltimore Civic Center]] (1st Mariner Arena).<ref>{{cite  web|author=Herbert H.

The railroad only survived because of a law exempting it from taxes.  In January 1931, during the [[Great Depression]], the extension of the law failed to pass by one vote and the line went into receivership.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&court=us&vol=289&invol=36| title= Williams v.

Evans bought the [[Northern Virginia trolleys|Arlington and Fairfax]] railroad the next year. Over time, the rails were hauled away, though by the beginning of World War II some remained and at least one post-War home in the area used old rails in lieu of I-beams. The right of way within Washington, D.C., remained under the ownership of WRECo and then the old [[Capital Transit Company]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://historical.maptech.com/getImage.cfm?fname=wshe45se.jpg&state=MD|title= USGS 7.5 Minute Series map of Washington East, MD Quadrangle|year=1945|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> At some point between 1951 and 1956, the tracks in D.C. were removed.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Geological Survey Maps|url=https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/maps/TopoView/viewer/#8/39.062/-76.555|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe right of way of the North Shore Line and some equipment was bought by the Bondholders Protective Society, who then formed the [[Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad Company]], which continued to operate rail passenger service between Baltimore and Annapolis until 1950 and freight service along with diesel passenger buses into the early 1970s to [[Brooklyn, Baltimore|Brooklyn]] in South Baltimore, connecting with the #6 transit line for streetcars and buses of the old [[Baltimore Transit Company]].\n\nWhile the vast majority of the South Shore division was abandoned and sold for scrap in the 1930s, the portion between Annapolis Junction and Odenton was purchased and operated by the B&O to serve Fort Meade until sometime between 1979 and 1981. It too was removed. Only the junction tracks at Annapolis Junction, which are used by an aggregates terminal, and an abandoned spur to the old Nevamar plant in Odenton remain.\n\n=== Accidents ===\n\nOn June 5, 1908, two of WB&A's single-car trains collided at Camp Parole, Maryland.

It branches off of [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] [[Northeast Corridor]] just south of [[Maryland Route 175|MD 175/Annapolis Road]] and travels east past the Odenton Library and across [[Maryland Route 170|MD 170/Piney Orchard Parkway]] at grade before turning north to cross Annapolis Road, also at-grade. It then travels a short distance north to the site of the old Nevamar Company's manufacturing plant. That plant shut down in 2004 and trains haven't run on the spur since. \n* At the northeast corner of the location where the track listed above crosses MD 170 (Telegraph Road) is a brick building that once housed the WB&A operations headquarters. The Baltimore-Washington main line and Fort Meade-Annapolis (South Shore) branch crossed at this location, known as \"Naval Academy Junction.\" The interlocking tower that controlled this crossing comprised the second floor. Commercial office tenants occupy the building today.\n* The \"Naval Academy Junction\" shops sat about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} north of \"Naval Academy Junction,\" on the east side of MD 170. The brick shop buildings were subsumed into a larger building complex that housed a number of manufacturing companies, including Nevamar Plastics, but those shops were torn down in 2013. The electrical power plant for this section of the WB&A overhead still stands, and is visible from MD 170.\n* Two portions of the [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail|WB&A Trail]], one from Odenton Town Center to the Two Rivers development and another {{convert|5.8|mi|km|adj=on}} section from the [[Patuxent River]] to Glenn Dale, run on the old [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] of the Main Line.  These two portions of the trail are not connected due, in part, to a property dispute that diverted the trail west in Anne Arundel County where a bridge will be built later. \n* The trestle over Horsepen Branch on the Bowie Race Track spur, and short sections of roadbed on either side of the trestle. (A nearby rail trail signed \"WB&A Spur Trail\" branches off of the WB&A Trail and was built on a route that once served the race track, but the route was actually constructed subsequent to the WB&A's demise, by the Pennsylvania Railroad.).\n* [[Maryland Route 704|MD 704]] was built on the right-of-way.\n* A [[freight motor]], Washington Baltimore & Annapolis #1, is maintained at the [[Western Railway Museum]] in [[Rio Vista, California]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book| author=Merriken, John E.| year=1993| title=Every Hour On The Hour; A Chronicle of the Washington, Baltimore & Annapolis Electric Railroad| publisher=Taylor Publishing Company| isbn=0-9600938-3-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Attached KML}}\n*[http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/b&a_trail.html Baltimore & Annapolis Trail Park]\n*[http://www.borail.org/ Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum]\n*[http://www.aacounty.org/RecParks/parks/trails/wbandatrailpark.cfm Anne Arundel County portion of the WB&A Trail]\n*[http://www.pgparks.com/Your_Parks/Trails/Washington__Baltimore___Annapolis_htm.htm Prince George's County portion of the WB&A Trail]\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/oldmainline/wasaer1.htm Modern-day photo tour of South Shore Line]\n*[http://www.newdavesrailpix.com/odds/md/md.htm#wba Photos of the rolling stock]\n*[http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/catalog/photos/cfm/dsp_unit.cfm?id=61675 Photo of Car in Annapolis]\n\n{{US railroad lists}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Washington Baltimore Annapolis Electric Railway}}\n[[Category:Defunct Maryland railroads]]\n[[Category:Defunct Washington, D.C., railroads]]\n[[Category:Street railways in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Interurban railways in Maryland]]\n[[Category:Interurban railways in Washington, D.C.]]\n", "name_user": "Pi.1415926535", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSurviving landmarks:fix link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_Baltimore_and_Annapolis_Electric_Railway"}
{"title_page": "Noncototient", "text_new": "In mathematics, a '''noncototient''' is a positive integer ''n'' that cannot be expressed as the difference between a positive integer ''m'' and the number of [[coprime]] integers below it. That is, ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;\u03c6(''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'', where \u03c6 stands for [[Euler's totient function]], has no solution for&nbsp;''m''.  The ''[[cototient]]'' of ''n'' is defined as ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;\u03c6(''n''), so a '''noncototient''' is a number that is never a cototient.\n\nIt is conjectured that all noncototients are even. This follows from a modified form of the slightly stronger version of the [[Goldbach conjecture]]: if the even number ''n'' can be represented as a sum of two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q,'' then\n\n:<math>pq - \\varphi(pq) = pq - (p-1)(q-1) = p+q-1 = n-1. \\,</math>\n\nIt is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 5 is a noncototient.

Sch\u00e4fer did not allow Bl\u00fcm to visit the colony, which Bl\u00fcm later said was a \"modelfarm of contempt for mankind\". \nIn 1988, the German attorney general finally started proceedings against members of the colony.<ref=ard2/>\n\nIn 1990, after Pinochet stepped down [[Patricio Aylwin]] cut off state funding for Sch\u00e4fer\u00b4s hospital, revoking its nonprofit, charitable status and audited the colony\u2019s businesses.<ref name=\"falc\"/> In 1991, Sch\u00e4fer privatized his various enterprises.
