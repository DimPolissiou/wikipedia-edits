Carrying [[U.S. Route 13 in Virginia|US 13]] for most of its length, it also carries [[U.S. Route 58 in Virginia|US 58]], and [[US Route 460 in Virginia|US 460]] while in Chesapeake. It is a major alternate route for the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]], crossing four major freeways along its length.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Original construction ===\n\nDuring World War II, the military build-up meant more people locating in the South Hampton Roads area, bringing many automobiles to the area. The [[United States Military|military]] needed to move personnel and materials fast and could not be bogged down in traffic. Federal, state and officials of the [[independent city]] of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] came up with a plan to build a more efficient highway to alleviate traffic problems. All parties agreed on a {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} long semi-circumferential section, from the western edge of [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] just outside [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] through a portion of [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]] to reach [[Admiral Taussig Boulevard]] (then [[State Route 170 (Virginia 1940-1957)|VA 170]]) near the [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Navy Base]] at [[Sewell's Point]].\n\nThe proposed \"super\" highway, named Military Highway, was designed and built in 1943 for approximately $2.5 million. Military Highway can lay claim to a lot of \"firsts.\" It was one of the first multi-lane highways (4-lanes, two in each direction) constructed in the area. The new roadway included several overpasses, bridges, interchanges, and a [[roundabout]] called Lansdale Traffic Circle. The [[cloverleaf interchange]] constructed at Military Highway and [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] was the first ever built in Virginia. Near the western end, there were {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} S-curves as the highway passed on a bridge over the [[Virginian Railway]], with short approach fills and considerable grades. The newly created feature became known as [[Bower's Hill]], although the area had that name much earlier, by the mid 19th century, according to old maps. As one of the highest features for miles around, Bower's Hill on the Military Highway became something of a landmark for travelers.\n\nThe [[Gilmerton Bridge]], a new [[drawbridge]], was built to cross the [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River]], a location which provides access to port facilities and is a portion of the [[Intracoastal Waterway|Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway]]. Military Highway also crosses the [[Eastern Branch Elizabeth River]] on a fixed span [[bridge]].\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n\nAfter World War II, businesses and residential development soared. In 1959, [[JANAF Shopping Yard]] at the intersection of Virginia Beach Boulevard became the largest [[shopping center]] in Virginia for many years. As the area grew, [[Military Circle Mall]] (Norfolk's first indoor shopping mall in 1970), Best Square Shopping Center and other large developments soon located nearby. These brought thousands of additional people into the area to live, work and shop. With the influx of people came even more cars. The road was the site of the first [[Econo-Travel]] motel, which grew to become a major national motel chain (now [[Econolodge]]).\n\nEven with the new [[Interstate Highway]]s in the area built beginning in the 1960s, by the 1980s, more than 50,000 vehicles traveled along Military Highway daily with 67,000 vehicles expected by the year 2010. The old \"super\" highway could no longer support the increased traffic volumes. The existing lanes were insufficient to handle the traffic and the bridges, especially at the Military Highway/Virginia Beach Boulevard cloverleaf, which had physically deteriorated to a point where restricting commercial vehicles, due to their weight, and reduction of speed was necessary. Reconstruction work began in 1985, and the busiest sections of the Military Highway, mostly a local thoroughfare, were modernized.\n\n==Route description==\nMilitary Highway effectively begins in Suffolk outside the [[Hampton Roads Executive Airport]], picking up the designations of U.S. 13, U.S. 460, and U.S. 58 from Portsmouth Boulevard. It continues generally northeastward as '''West Military Highway''', crossing under and interchanging in [[Bowers Hill]] with [[Interstate 664|I-664]] (which shortly thereafter splits in its own Y-interchange with [[Interstate 264 (Virginia)|I-264]] and [[Interstate 64 (Virginia)|I-64]]). It also intersects in this same area with Airline Boulevard, to which it loses [[U.S. Route 58 in Virginia|US 58]]. After this complex set of interchanges and intersections, it becomes '''South Military Highway''' and turns southeastward, paralleling I-64 before crossing under it 2 miles later. It then continues east through Chesapeake, intersecting George Washington Highway ([[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|US 17]]) and crosses the [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River]] on the [[Gilmerton Bridge]].\n\nAfter crossing the river, the road loses U.S. 460 to Bainbridge Blvd ([[Virginia State Route 166|SR 166]]), and continues through its interchange with [[Interstate 464 (Virginia)|I-464]], paralleling I-64 for the rest of its journey through Chesapeake and Virginia Beach. Military Highway then crosses under and interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 168|State Route 168]] at Battlefield Boulevard on a cloverleaf interchange, and then expands to six lanes, which continues until it narrows back to four lanes after Greenbrier Parkway.\n\nAfter Greenbrier Parkway, the highway continues on a north-northeasterly heading through Chesapeake until it enters the city of [[Virginia Beach]] (and subsequently re-expanding to six lanes) and intersects at Indian River Road (to [[Virginia State Route 407|SR 407]]), where it then expands to eight lanes and continues almost due north. It then crosses the Elizabeth River for the second time near the Broad Creek, enters the city of Norfolk, and interchanges with I-264 again in a cloverleaf interchange. Continuing as '''North Military Highway''', it then expands to ten lanes, passing [[Military Circle Mall]] (formerly known as the Gallery at Military Circle) as it crosses with U.S. 58 at Virginia Beach Boulevard with a hybrid [[single-point urban interchange]].\n\nAfter the interchange, Military Highway reduces back to eight lanes and continues past several shopping centers, including [[JANAF Shopping Center]], and a [[Wal-Mart]] Supercenter. After both shopping centers, the highway continues onto its intersection with [[Virginia State Route 166|SR 166]] (Princess Anne Road) and Northampton Boulevard, to which it finally loses its U.S. 13 designation. It then, however picks up designation as [[Virginia State Route 165|SR 165]]. It reduces to an undivided four-lane roadway, crosses I-64 in a partial interchange, and curves northwestward, passing the runways at [[Norfolk International Airport]]. As it continues to wind its way through Norfolk, it remains four lanes undivided, and crosses its final two state routes of [[Virginia State Route 192|SR 192]] (Azalea Garden Road) and [[Virginia State Route 247|SR 247]] (Norview Avenue). The road then continues until it ends in a [[T-intersection]] with [[Virginia State Route 170|SR 170]] at its eastern terminus on Little Creek Road.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{VAinttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/>}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city_special=[[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]]-[[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]] city line\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|13|US|58|US|460|dir1=south|dir2=west|dir3=west|city1=Petersburg|city2=Emporia}}\n|notes=Western terminus; road continues as Portsmouth Boulevard.\n}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Chesapeake\n|lspan=4\n|mile=2.94\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|664|to2=y|I|64|I|264|name1=[[Hampton Roads Beltway]]|city1=Portsmouth|city2=Norfolk|city3=Virginia Beach|city4=Newport News|city5=Hampton}}\n|notes=I-664 exit 13\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=3.05\n|mspan=2\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|58|dir1=east|US-Alt|460|dab2=Chesapeake\u2013Norfolk|dir2=east|name2=Airline Boulevard|city1=Portsmouth}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;58 concurrency; western terminus of US&nbsp;460 Alt.\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=none\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|191|dir1=north|name1=Joliff Road}}\n|notes=Western end of SR&nbsp;191 concurrency\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=3.23\n|type=concur\n|road=West Military Highway\n|notes=Eastern end of SR&nbsp;191 concurrency; road becomes South Military Highway.\n}}\n{{jctgap|text=see [[U.S. Route 13 in Virginia#Major intersections|US&nbsp;13]] (mile 30.97-42.19)}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Norfolk\n|lspan=8\n|mile=19.37\n|mspan=2\n|type=trans\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|13|dir1=north|SR|165|dir2=south|SR|166|dir3=north|name3=Northhampton Boulevard|to4=y|I|64|dir4=east|city1=Virginia Beach|location2=[[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]]}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;13 concurrency; western end of SR&nbsp;165 concurrency\n|nspan=2\n}}\n{{VAint\n|type=trans\n|mile=none\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|166|dir1=west|name1=Princess Anne Road|location1=[[Norfolk International Airport]]|city2=Downtown Norfolk}}\n|notes=none\n}}\n{{VAint\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=19.99\n|mspan=2\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|dir1=west|city1=Richmond}}\n|notes=Eastbound exit and westbound entrance; I-64 exit 281\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=none\n|road=Robin Hood Road\n|notes=Former [[Virginia State Route 192 (1951\u20131952)|SR&nbsp;192]] north\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=20.59\n|road={{jct|state=VA|road|Azalea Garden Road|name1=[[Virginia State Route 192|SR&nbsp;192]] north}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=20.98\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|247|name1=Norview Avenue|to2=to|I|64|location1=[[Norfolk Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]]|location2=Norfolk International Airport}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=22.63\n|mspan=2\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|165|dir1=north|name1=East Little Creek Road|location1=[[Ocean View (Norfolk)|Ocean View]]|location2=[[Naval Station Norfolk|Naval Base]]}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n|nspan=2\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=none\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|170|dir1=east|name1=East Little Creek Road|city1=Little Creek}}\n|notes=none\n}}\n{{jctbtm|keys=concur,incomplete,trans}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The eastern end of Military Highway in Norfolk was truncated and is now located at the intersection of Little Creek Road.

The old \"super\" highway could no longer support the increased traffic volumes. The existing lanes were insufficient to handle the traffic and the bridges, especially at the Military Highway/Virginia Beach Boulevard cloverleaf, which had physically deteriorated to a point where restricting commercial vehicles, due to their weight, and reduction of speed was necessary. Reconstruction work began in 1985, and the busiest sections of the Military Highway, mostly a local thoroughfare, were modernized.\n\n==Route description==\nMilitary Highway effectively begins in Suffolk outside the [[Hampton Roads Executive Airport]], picking up the designations of U.S. 13, U.S. 460, and U.S. 58 from Portsmouth Boulevard. It continues generally northeastward as '''West Military Highway''', crossing under and interchanging in [[Bowers Hill]] with [[Interstate 664|I-664]] (which shortly thereafter splits in its own Y-interchange with [[Interstate 264 (Virginia)|I-264]] and [[Interstate 64 (Virginia)|I-64]]). It also intersects in this same area with Airline Boulevard, to which it loses [[U.S. Route 58 in Virginia|US 58]]. After this complex set of interchanges and intersections, it becomes '''South Military Highway''' and turns southeastward, paralleling I-64 before crossing under it 2 miles later. It then continues east through Chesapeake, intersecting George Washington Highway ([[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|US 17]]) and crosses the [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River]] on the [[Gilmerton Bridge]].\n\nAfter crossing the river, the road loses U.S. 460 to Bainbridge Blvd ([[Virginia State Route 166|SR 166]]), and continues through its interchange with [[Interstate 464 (Virginia)|I-464]], paralleling I-64 for the rest of its journey through Chesapeake and Virginia Beach. Military Highway then crosses under and interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 168|State Route 168]] at Battlefield Boulevard on a cloverleaf interchange, and then expands to six lanes, which continues until it narrows back to four lanes after Greenbrier Parkway.\n\nAfter Greenbrier Parkway, the highway continues on a north-northeasterly heading through Chesapeake until it enters the city of [[Virginia Beach]] (and subsequently re-expanding to six lanes) and intersects at Indian River Road (to [[Virginia State Route 407|SR 407]]), where it then expands to eight lanes and continues almost due north. It then crosses the Elizabeth River for the second time near the Broad Creek, enters the city of Norfolk, and interchanges with I-264 again in a cloverleaf interchange. Continuing as '''North Military Highway''', it then expands to ten lanes, passing [[Military Circle Mall]] (formerly known as the Gallery at Military Circle) as it crosses with U.S. 58 at Virginia Beach Boulevard with a hybrid [[single-point urban interchange]].\n\nAfter the interchange, Military Highway reduces back to eight lanes and continues past several shopping centers, including [[JANAF Shopping Center]], and a [[Wal-Mart]] Supercenter. After both shopping centers, the highway continues onto its intersection with [[Virginia State Route 166|SR 166]] (Princess Anne Road) and Northampton Boulevard, to which it finally loses its U.S. 13 designation. It then, however picks up designation as [[Virginia State Route 165|SR 165]]. It reduces to an undivided four-lane roadway, crosses I-64 in a partial interchange, and curves northwestward, passing the runways at [[Norfolk International Airport]]. As it continues to wind its way through Norfolk, it remains four lanes undivided, and crosses its final two state routes of [[Virginia State Route 192|SR 192]] (Azalea Garden Road) and [[Virginia State Route 247|SR 247]] (Norview Avenue). The road then continues until it ends in a [[T-intersection]] with [[Virginia State Route 170|SR 170]] at its eastern terminus on Little Creek Road.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{VAinttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/>}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city_special=[[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]]-[[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]] city line\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|13|US|58|US|460|dir1=south|dir2=west|dir3=west|city1=Petersburg|city2=Emporia}}\n|notes=Western terminus; road continues as Portsmouth Boulevard.\n}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Chesapeake\n|lspan=4\n|mile=2.94\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|664|to2=y|I|64|I|264|name1=[[Hampton Roads Beltway]]|city1=Portsmouth|city2=Norfolk|city3=Virginia Beach|city4=Newport News|city5=Hampton}}\n|notes=I-664 exit 13\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=3.05\n|mspan=2\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|58|dir1=east|US-Alt|460|dab2=Chesapeake\u2013Norfolk|dir2=east|name2=Airline Boulevard|city1=Portsmouth}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;58 concurrency; western terminus of US&nbsp;460 Alt.\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=none\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|191|dir1=north|name1=Joliff Road}}\n|notes=Western end of SR&nbsp;191 concurrency\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=3.23\n|type=concur\n|road=West Military Highway\n|notes=Eastern end of SR&nbsp;191 concurrency; road becomes South Military Highway.\n}}\n{{jctgap|text=see [[U.S. Route 13 in Virginia#Major intersections|US&nbsp;13]] (mile 30.97-42.19)}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Norfolk\n|lspan=8\n|mile=19.37\n|mspan=2\n|type=trans\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|13|dir1=north|SR|165|dir2=south|SR|166|dir3=north|name3=Northhampton Boulevard|to4=y|I|64|dir4=east|city1=Virginia Beach|location2=[[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]]}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;13 concurrency; western end of SR&nbsp;165 concurrency\n|nspan=2\n}}\n{{VAint\n|type=trans\n|mile=none\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|166|dir1=west|name1=Princess Anne Road|location1=[[Norfolk International Airport]]|city2=Downtown Norfolk}}\n|notes=none\n}}\n{{VAint\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=19.99\n|mspan=2\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|dir1=west|city1=Richmond}}\n|notes=Eastbound exit and westbound entrance; I-64 exit 281\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=none\n|road=Robin Hood Road\n|notes=Former [[Virginia State Route 192 (1951\u20131952)|SR&nbsp;192]] north\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=20.59\n|road={{jct|state=VA|road|Azalea Garden Road|name1=[[Virginia State Route 192|SR&nbsp;192]] north}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=20.98\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|247|name1=Norview Avenue|to2=to|I|64|location1=[[Norfolk Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]]|location2=Norfolk International Airport}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=22.63\n|mspan=2\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|165|dir1=north|name1=East Little Creek Road|location1=[[Ocean View (Norfolk)|Ocean View]]|location2=[[Naval Station Norfolk|Naval Base]]}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n|nspan=2\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=none\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|170|dir1=east|name1=East Little Creek Road|city1=Little Creek}}\n|notes=none\n}}\n{{jctbtm|keys=concur,incomplete,trans}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*The eastern end of Military Highway in Norfolk was truncated and is now located at the intersection of Little Creek Road. Little Creek Road west of this point follows the former path of the original Military Highway.\n*Military Highway outlasted its two major host localities, [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne]] and [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] counties, both of which are now extinct. In modern times, following a wave of political consolidations and mergers in the second half of the 20th century, Military Highway is now entirely located in the [[independent city|independent cities]] of [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].\n*[[Mercury Boulevard]] across the harbor of [[Hampton Roads]] on the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the cities of [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] was also named \"Military Highway\" when it was built. However, that roadway was later renamed to honor the [[Project Mercury]] space program of [[NASA]] at [[Langley Air Force Base]].\n{{Crossings navbox\n|structure = River Crossings|place = [[Eastern Branch Elizabeth River|Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River]]|downstream = [[Interstate 64]] Twin Bridges|downstream signs = [[Image:I-64.svg|30px]]|bridge = Military Highway|bridge signs = [[Image:US 13.svg|30px]]|upstream = [[Campostella Bridge ]]|upstream signs = [[Image:US 460.svg|30px]][[Image:Virginia 166.svg|30px]][[Image:Virginia 168.svg|30px]]}}{{Water Crossings in the Hampton Roads Region}}\n\n[[Category:Transportation in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Norfolk, Virginia]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 13]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Chesapeake, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Virginia Beach, Virginia]]\n[[Category:U.S. Route 58]]\n", "name_user": "Morriswa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTrivia:Re-sorted categories", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Highway"}

Order members teach two practices: (a) \"The mindfulness of breathing\" ([[anapanasati]]), in which practitioners focus on the rise and fall of the breath; and (b) \"The [[metta]] bhavana\", which approximately translates from the original [[Pali]] as \"the cultivation of lovingkindness\". These practices are felt to be complementary in promoting equanimity and friendliness towards others. Some friends of the Order may have little, if any, other involvement in its activities; but friendship, Sangha, and community are encouraged at all levels as essential contexts for meditation.\n\nThe founder, Sangharakshita, described meditation as having four phases. The first two according to his system ('integration' and 'positive emotion', can be correlated to the traditional category of \"calming\" \"[[samatha]]\" practices, and the last two (spiritual death and spiritual rebirth) can be correlated to \"insight\" or \"[[vipassana]]\" practices. For those not ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order, the practices associated with the first two are emphasised, though the spirit of the last two is also taught.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\">{{citation | first=Christopher | last=Partridge | year=2004 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religions | publisher=Lion | isbn=978-0-7459-5073-0 | page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofne0000unse_d3h6/page/194 194] | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofne0000unse_d3h6/page/194 }}</ref>\n\nThese phases are:\n\n# '''Integration.''' The main practice at this stage is the mindfulness of breathing, which is intended to have the effect of \"integrating the psyche\" \u2013 improving mindfulness and concentration, and reducing psychological conflict.\n# '''Positive emotion.''' The second aspect of samatha is developing positivity \u2013 an other-regarding, life-affirming attitude. The [[Brahmavihara]] meditations, especially the 'metta bhavana' or cultivation of loving kindness meditations, are the key practices intended to foster the development of positive emotion.\n# '''Spiritual death.''' The next stage is to develop insight into what is seen to be the emptiness of the self and reality. Meditations at this stage include considering the elements of which self and world are thought to be composed; contemplating impermance (particularly of the body); contemplating suffering; and contemplating [[sunyata]].\n# '''Spiritual rebirth.''' The WBO teaches that, with the development of insight and the death of the limited ego-self, a person is spiritually reborn. Practices which involve the visualization of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are among the main practices in this phase. At ordination, each dharmachari(ni) is given an advanced visualisation meditation on a particular figure.\n\nCentres also teach scripture, [[yoga]] and other methods of self-improvement, some of which are felt by some commentators to come from outside the Buddhist tradition.<ref>{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}</ref> Recently, community activities have begun to include outdoor festivals, online meditation courses, arts festivals, poetry and writing workshops, tai chi, karate, and pilgrimages to Buddhist holy sites in India.

The most common ritual consists of a puja, derived and adapted from the ''[[Bodhicaryavatara]]'' of [[Shantideva]].\n\n[[Retreats]] provide a chance to focus on meditational practice more intensely, in a residential context outside of a retreatant's everyday life.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 308\">{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/308 308] | url=https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/308 }}</ref> community retreats can be broadly categorised into meditation retreats, study retreats, and solitary retreats. Retreat lengths vary from short weekends to one or two weeks.\n\nBusinesses, said to operate to the principle of \"right livelihood\", generate funds for the movement, as well seeking to provide environments for spiritual growth through employment.<ref>{{citation | first=Christopher S | last=Queen | year=2005 | title=Engaged Buddhism in the West | publisher=Wisdom Publications | isbn=978-0-86171-159-8| page=373}}</ref> Emphasis is placed on teamwork, and on contributing to the welfare of others: for example by funding social projects and by considering ethical matters such as fair trade.

It is not identified with any particular strand or school of Buddhism, but draws inspiration from many. It calls itself \"ecumenical\" rather than \"eclectic\" because it is founded on the premise that there is an underlying unity to all schools.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 308\"/>\n# '''\"Going for [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]]\" is central.''' \"Going for Refuge to the [[Three Jewels]]\" \u2013 meaning the [[Buddha]], the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] \u2013 is considered to be what makes someone a Buddhist.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\"/>\n# '''A unified Order.''' Unlike some sangha, the community does not propagate a monastic lineage. Sangharakshita devised a non-monastic ordination system, whilst also allowing the undertaking of the \"anagarika\" precept which enjoins celibacy. Identical ordination is open to both sexes. While the movement regards single-sex activities as important to spiritual growth, men and women are recognised as being equally able to practice and develop spiritually.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 309\">{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/309 309] | url=https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/309 }}</ref>\n# '''An emphasis on spiritual friendship.''' There is a strong emphasis on the sangha, and spiritual friendship based on shared values. The community teaches that spending time with friends who share ideals, and engaging in ritual practice with them, supports ethical living and the arising of the [[bodhicitta]].<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 117\"/>\n# '''Teamwork.''' Working together in teams, in the spirit of generosity and with a focus on ethics, is considered a transformative spiritual practice.<ref name=\"Baumann 1998\"/>\n# '''Importance of art.''' Engagement in, and an appreciation of, the arts are considered to be a valuable aspect of spiritual practice. The community teaches that a refinement of one's artistic tastes can help refine emotional sensitivity and provide a channel for the expression of right living, and spiritual growth. More broadly, the movement seeks ways to re-express Buddhism by making connections with sympathetic elements in the surrounding culture, regarding the arts as such an aspect of western culture.<ref>{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge| place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}</ref>\n\n\"The FWBO's attitude to spreading the Dharma is one of heartfelt urgency,\" wrote [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], a prominent British Buddhist author, in a book published in 1994.<ref name=\"Batchelor 1994 339\">{{citation | first=Stephen | last=Batchelor | year=1994 | title=The Awakening of the West | publisher=Aquarian | isbn=978-0-938077-69-5 | page=339}}</ref> \"For the FWBO, Western Society as such needs to be subject to the unflinching scrutiny of Buddhist values.\"\n\n==The Triratna Buddhist Order==\nThe Triratna Buddhist Order is the focal-point of the community,<ref>{{citation | first=Peter| last=Clarke| year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}</ref> and is a network of friendships between individuals who have made personal commitments to the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha, in communion with others.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\"/>\nMembers are known as dharmacharis (masculine) or dharmacharinis (feminine), and are ordained in accord with a ceremony formulated by the founder. At ordination they are given a religious name in Pali or Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Clarke 2005 198\">{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=198}}</ref> While there is an informal hierarchy within the order, there are no higher ordinations. A small number of members, however, take vows of celibacy and adopt a simpler lifestyle. Contrary to the traditional Buddhist structure of separating lay and monastic members, the order combines monastic and lay lifestyles under one ordination,<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\"/> a practice not dissimilar to that which evolved in some Japanese schools of Buddhism.<ref>Neither Monk nor Layman: Clerical Marriage in Modern Japanese Buddhism Richard Jaffe. Published by Princeton University Press and copyrighted, \u00a9 2002, by Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-07495-X}}</ref>\n\nAs with followers of the [[Shingon]] school of Buddhism, order members observe ten precepts (ethical training rules).<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 117\"/> These precepts are different from monastic vows and do not appear in the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], but were formulated on the basis of the so-called \"dasa-kusala-dhammas\" (ten wholesome actions). These are found in several places in the [[P\u0101li Canon]], as well as in some Sanskrit sources. The [[karma]] sections of the fundamental meditation texts of all four schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] also list these acts as basic guidelines for lay or ordained practitioners intent on observing the law of cause and effect.<ref>Pali sources: the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, (MN 41:8\u201314). (See also: DN 114, MN.114, AN vol.

In mid-2008, there were around 1,500 members of the order, in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 193\"/>\n\n==The wider community==\nIn the Triratna community, as in the [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] traditions, ''sangha'' is interpreted as the Buddhist community as a whole. Someone who regularly attends community activities is considered to be a \"friend\". Friends do not have to regard themselves as Buddhists, and can be of any faith, or none. Some choose, after some time, to participate in a formal ceremony of affiliation, and thus become a \"mitra.\" \"Mitra\" is [[Sanskrit]] for \"friend\", which in this case denotes a person who considers themselves Buddhist, who makes an effort to live in accordance with the five ethical precepts, and who feels that this spiritual community is the appropriate one for them.\n\nThose who wish to join the Order must request this in writing. It will then take several years to prepare for ordination. This is an informal process, the focus of which is to deepen one's commitment.<ref>{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=116}}</ref>\n\nSome Friends, Mitras and Order members decide, at least for a while, to study teachings from outside the community, including non-Buddhist traditions such as [[Sufism]].<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 81\">{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=81}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAs the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, the community was founded in London in April 1967 by [[Sangharakshita]].

In a book published in 2005, the FWBO's members and supporters were estimated to number 100,000, the majority of whom were in India.<ref name=\"Queen 2005 378\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the responsibility for ordination and spiritual leadership passed to a \"preceptor's college\", based in [[Birmingham]].<ref name=\"Clarke 2005 198\"/> In 2000, the first chair of a preceptor's council was chosen by Sangharakshita. In future, this position will be elected by the WBO to five-year terms.<ref name=\"Clarke 2005 198\"/>\n\nIn 2003, the public preceptors, responding to feedback, decided to move away from a formal relationship to the order and movement, and to concentrate on the ordination of new order members, teaching and dharma practice. At the same time, to increase flexibility, the number of preceptors was expanded.\n\n==Name change==\nIn the spring of 2010, the Western Buddhist Order and Friends of the Western Buddhist Order changed their names to the Triratna Buddhist Order (which approximates in English to the name used in India - Triratna Bauddha Mahasangha) and the Triratna Buddhist Community. Since its western foundation the movement had spread to other parts of the world, including India where it was known by a different, non-western, name, and Indian members had long wished for one single worldwide name.

The report described intimate details of what Dunlop characterised as their relationship, and claimed that Sangharakshita, who declined to comment, had told him \u201cthat to develop spiritually he had to get over his anti-homosexual conditioning.\u201d\n\nThe report contained further allegations from an anonymous source, who said that he had been persuaded into a sexual relationship with the leader of FWBO's centre in [[Croydon]], south of London. \u201cThe head of the community was a very powerful, intrusive personality and incredibly manipulative. He would intuitively become aware of people's vulnerabilities,\u201d the source was reported to have said.\n\nA third concern drew on complaints by the mother of a former FWBO member who had committed suicide in 1990, following a history of depression.

Order members teach two practices: (a) \"The mindfulness of breathing\" ([[anapanasati]]), in which practitioners focus on the rise and fall of the breath; and (b) \"The [[metta]] bhavana\", which approximately translates from the original [[Pali]] as \"the cultivation of lovingkindness\". These practices are felt to be complementary in promoting equanimity and friendliness towards others. Some friends of the Order may have little, if any, other involvement in its activities; but friendship, Sangha, and community are encouraged at all levels as essential contexts for meditation.\n\nThe founder, Sangharakshita, described meditation as having four phases. The first two according to his system ('integration' and 'positive emotion', can be correlated to the traditional category of \"calming\" \"[[samatha]]\" practices, and the last two (spiritual death and spiritual rebirth) can be correlated to \"insight\" or \"[[vipassana]]\" practices. For those not ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order, the practices associated with the first two are emphasised, though the spirit of the last two is also taught.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\">{{citation | first=Christopher | last=Partridge | year=2004 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religions | publisher=Lion | isbn=978-0-7459-5073-0 | page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofne0000unse_d3h6/page/194 194] | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofne0000unse_d3h6/page/194 }}</ref>\n\nThese phases are:\n\n# '''Integration.''' The main practice at this stage is the mindfulness of breathing, which is intended to have the effect of \"integrating the psyche\" \u2013 improving mindfulness and concentration, and reducing psychological conflict.\n# '''Positive emotion.''' The second aspect of samatha is developing positivity \u2013 an other-regarding, life-affirming attitude. The [[Brahmavihara]] meditations, especially the 'metta bhavana' or cultivation of loving kindness meditations, are the key practices intended to foster the development of positive emotion.\n# '''Spiritual death.''' The next stage is to develop insight into what is seen to be the emptiness of the self and reality. Meditations at this stage include considering the elements of which self and world are thought to be composed; contemplating impermance (particularly of the body); contemplating suffering; and contemplating [[sunyata]].\n# '''Spiritual rebirth.''' The WBO teaches that, with the development of insight and the death of the limited ego-self, a person is spiritually reborn. Practices which involve the visualization of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are among the main practices in this phase. At ordination, each dharmachari(ni) is given an advanced visualisation meditation on a particular figure.\n\nCentres also teach scripture, [[yoga]] and other methods of self-improvement, some of which are felt by some commentators to come from outside the Buddhist tradition.<ref>{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}</ref> Recently, community activities have begun to include outdoor festivals, online meditation courses, arts festivals, poetry and writing workshops, tai chi, karate, and pilgrimages to Buddhist holy sites in India.

The most common ritual consists of a puja, derived and adapted from the ''[[Bodhicaryavatara]]'' of [[Shantideva]].\n\n[[Retreats]] provide a chance to focus on meditational practice more intensely, in a residential context outside of a retreatant's everyday life.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 308\">{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/308 308] | url=https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/308 }}</ref> community retreats can be broadly categorised into meditation retreats, study retreats, and solitary retreats.

It is not identified with any particular strand or school of Buddhism, but draws inspiration from many. It calls itself \"ecumenical\" rather than \"eclectic\" because it is founded on the premise that there is an underlying unity to all schools.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 308\"/>\n# '''\"Going for [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]]\" is central.''' \"Going for Refuge to the [[Three Jewels]]\" \u2013 meaning the [[Buddha]], the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] \u2013 is considered to be what makes someone a Buddhist.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\"/>\n# '''A unified Order.''' Unlike some sangha, the community does not propagate a monastic lineage. Sangharakshita devised a non-monastic ordination system, whilst also allowing the undertaking of the \"anagarika\" precept which enjoins celibacy. Identical ordination is open to both sexes. While the movement regards single-sex activities as important to spiritual growth, men and women are recognised as being equally able to practice and develop spiritually.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 309\">{{citation | first=D V | last=Barrett | year=2001 | title=The New Believers: Sects, 'Cults' and Alternative Religions | publisher=Cassell | isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/309 309] | url=https://archive.org/details/newbelieverssurv00barr/page/309 }}</ref>\n# '''An emphasis on spiritual friendship.''' There is a strong emphasis on the sangha, and spiritual friendship based on shared values. The community teaches that spending time with friends who share ideals, and engaging in ritual practice with them, supports ethical living and the arising of the [[bodhicitta]].<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 117\"/>\n# '''Teamwork.''' Working together in teams, in the spirit of generosity and with a focus on ethics, is considered a transformative spiritual practice.<ref name=\"Baumann 1998\"/>\n# '''Importance of art.''' Engagement in, and an appreciation of, the arts are considered to be a valuable aspect of spiritual practice. The community teaches that a refinement of one's artistic tastes can help refine emotional sensitivity and provide a channel for the expression of right living, and spiritual growth. More broadly, the movement seeks ways to re-express Buddhism by making connections with sympathetic elements in the surrounding culture, regarding the arts as such an aspect of western culture.<ref>{{citation | first=Peter | last=Clarke | year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge| place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}</ref>\n\n\"The FWBO's attitude to spreading the Dharma is one of heartfelt urgency,\" wrote [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], a prominent British Buddhist author, in a book published in 1994.<ref name=\"Batchelor 1994 339\">{{citation | first=Stephen | last=Batchelor | year=1994 | title=The Awakening of the West | publisher=Aquarian | isbn=978-0-938077-69-5 | page=339}}</ref> \"For the FWBO, Western Society as such needs to be subject to the unflinching scrutiny of Buddhist values.\"\n\n==The Triratna Buddhist Order==\nThe Triratna Buddhist Order is the focal-point of the community,<ref>{{citation | first=Peter| last=Clarke| year=2005 | title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | publisher=Routledge | place=London | isbn=978-0-415-26707-6 | page=197}}</ref> and is a network of friendships between individuals who have made personal commitments to the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha, in communion with others.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\"/>\nMembers are known as dharmacharis (masculine) or dharmacharinis (feminine), and are ordained in accord with a ceremony formulated by the founder.

A small number of members, however, take vows of celibacy and adopt a simpler lifestyle. Contrary to the traditional Buddhist structure of separating lay and monastic members, the order combines monastic and lay lifestyles under one ordination,<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 194\"/> a practice not dissimilar to that which evolved in some Japanese schools of Buddhism.<ref>Neither Monk nor Layman: Clerical Marriage in Modern Japanese Buddhism Richard Jaffe. Published by Princeton University Press and copyrighted, \u00a9 2002, by Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-07495-X}}</ref>\n\nAs with followers of the [[Shingon]] school of Buddhism, order members observe ten precepts (ethical training rules).<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 117\"/> These precepts are different from monastic vows and do not appear in the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], but were formulated on the basis of the so-called \"dasa-kusala-dhammas\" (ten wholesome actions). These are found in several places in the [[P\u0101li Canon]], as well as in some Sanskrit sources. The [[karma]] sections of the fundamental meditation texts of all four schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] also list these acts as basic guidelines for lay or ordained practitioners intent on observing the law of cause and effect.<ref>Pali sources: the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, (MN 41:8\u201314).

In mid-2008, there were around 1,500 members of the order, in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Partridge 2004 193\"/>\n\n==The wider community==\nIn the Triratna community, as in the [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] traditions, ''sangha'' is interpreted as the Buddhist community as a whole. Someone who regularly attends community activities is considered to be a \"friend\". Friends do not have to regard themselves as Buddhists, and can be of any faith, or none. Some choose, after some time, to participate in a formal ceremony of affiliation, and thus become a \"mitra.\" \"Mitra\" is [[Sanskrit]] for \"friend\", which in this case denotes a person who considers themselves Buddhist, who makes an effort to live in accordance with the five ethical precepts, and who feels that this spiritual community is the appropriate one for them.\n\nThose who wish to join the Order must request this in writing. It will then take several years to prepare for ordination. This is an informal process, the focus of which is to deepen one's commitment.<ref>{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=116}}</ref>\n\nSome Friends, Mitras and Order members decide, at least for a while, to study teachings from outside the community, including non-Buddhist traditions such as [[Sufism]].<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 81\">{{citation | first=James William | last=Coleman | year=2001 | title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-515241-8 | page=81}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAs the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, the community was founded in London in April 1967 by [[Sangharakshita]].

In a book published in 2005, the FWBO's members and supporters were estimated to number 100,000, the majority of whom were in India.<ref name=\"Queen 2005 378\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the responsibility for ordination and spiritual leadership passed to a \"preceptor's college\", based in [[Birmingham]].<ref name=\"Clarke 2005 198\"/> In 2000, the first chair of a preceptor's council was chosen by Sangharakshita. In future, this position will be elected by the WBO to five-year terms.<ref name=\"Clarke 2005 198\"/>\n\nIn 2003, the public preceptors, responding to feedback, decided to move away from a formal relationship to the order and movement, and to concentrate on the ordination of new order members, teaching and dharma practice. At the same time, to increase flexibility, the number of preceptors was expanded.\n\n==Name change==\nIn the spring of 2010, the Western Buddhist Order and Friends of the Western Buddhist Order changed their names to the Triratna Buddhist Order (which approximates in English to the name used in India - Triratna Bauddha Mahasangha) and the Triratna Buddhist Community. Since its western foundation the movement had spread to other parts of the world, including India where it was known by a different, non-western, name, and Indian members had long wished for one single worldwide name. An official history acknowledges this to have been controversial among some Order members.<ref name=\"Vajragupta 2010\">{{citation | last=Vajragupta | year=2010 | title=The Triratna Story: Behind the Scenes of a New Buddhist Movement | publisher= Windhorse | isbn=978-1-899579-92-1 }}</ref> (\"Triratna\", Sanskrit term meaning [[Three Jewels]])\n\n==Controversies and criticism==\n\n===Spiritual lineage===\nAlthough Sangharakshita studied under, and in some cases received initiations from, eminent Buddhist teachers during his two decades in [[India]],<ref>{{citation | first=Stephen | last=Batchelor | year=1994 | title=The Awakening of the West | publisher=Aquarian | isbn=978-0-938077-69-5 | pages=323\u2013332}}</ref> including [[Jagdish Kashyap]], [[Dhardo Rinpoche]], HH [[Dudjom Rinpoche]], HH [[Dilgo Khyentse]], and [[Dzongsar Khyentse Ch\u00f6kyi Lodr\u00f6|Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche]], author James William Coleman has noted that \"he never worked closely enough with any teacher to be recognized as a dharma-heir\".<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 81\"/>\n\nRather than leadership by a guru, the community instead operates through what has been called a \"friendly hierarchy,\"<ref>{{citation | first=A | last=Rawlinson | year=1997 | title=The Book of Enlightened Masters | publisher=Open Court | place=Chicago | isbn=978-0-8126-9310-2 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofenlightene00rawl/page/503 503] | url=https://archive.org/details/bookofenlightene00rawl/page/503 }}</ref> which some critics have said can cause problems.<ref name=\"Barrett 2001 309\"/> In 1997, [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], a prominent Buddhist commentator, was quoted as saying that the FWBO operated as \"a self-enclosed system\" and that their writings \"have the predictability of those who believe they have all the answers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The dark side of enlightenment|url=http://www.ex-cult.org/fwbo/Guardian.htm|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 27, 1997|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 Sangharakshita wrote of his \"conviction that the less the FWBO is involved with 'Buddhist groups' and with individuals affiliated to existing Buddhist traditions, the better.\"<ref>{{Citation |title=Travel Letters |last=Sangharakshita |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Windhorse Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-904766-17-2 |page= 173|url= |accessdate= }}</ref> Currently, however, the community is a member of the [[European Buddhist Union]] and the [[Network of Buddhist Organisations]],<ref>[http://www.nbo.org.uk/get-involved/buddhist-links/old-nbo-members-page Network of Buddhist Organisations] Accessed 14 April 2012.</ref> individual members of the order serve on the board of the [[International Network of Engaged Buddhists]],<ref>[http://www.inebnetwork.org/ineb/committee International Network of Engaged Buddhists > Committee] Accessed 14 April 2012.</ref> and the FWBO's former magazine, ''Dharma Life'',<ref>''[http://www.dharmalife.com/ Dharma Life]'' Accessed 14 April 2012.</ref> frequently carried articles by Buddhists from other organisations.\n\n===1997 ''Guardian'' report===\nIn October 1997, the FWBO and Western Buddhist Order were rocked<ref>{{citation | first= Dharmachari | last= Vishvapani | title=Perceptions of the FWBO in British Buddhism | publisher= Western Buddhist Review | volume= 13 | url= http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol3/Perceptions.htm}}</ref> by a report by [[Madeleine Bunting]], then the religious affairs correspondent of the British ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper, which made wide-ranging allegations of sexual misconduct, dogmatism and misogyny within the movement during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"Bunting\" /><ref name=\"Barrett 2001 309\" />\n\nThe most detailed complaints reported were claims by Mark Dunlop, who had lived with the movement's founder for a number of years in the early 1970s, and left the order in 1985. The report described intimate details of what Dunlop characterised as their relationship, and claimed that Sangharakshita, who declined to comment, had told him \u201cthat to develop spiritually he had to get over his anti-homosexual conditioning.\u201d\n\nThe report contained further allegations from an anonymous source, who said that he had been persuaded into a sexual relationship with the leader of FWBO's centre in [[Croydon]], south of London. \u201cThe head of the community was a very powerful, intrusive personality and incredibly manipulative. He would intuitively become aware of people's vulnerabilities,\u201d the source was reported to have said.\n\nA third concern drew on complaints by the mother of a former FWBO member who had committed suicide in 1990, following a history of depression. A report by a clinical psychologist said, among other things: \u201cHe feels the community attempted to alienate him from his family and from women, and that direct attempts were made to encourage him to practise homosexuality.

He conquered the Karluks in the west, the Kyrgyz in the north, and took the title Ichju [[Chebi Khan]]. The Karluks allied with the Tiele and their leaders the Uyghurs against the Turkic Kaganate, and participated in enthroning the victorious head of the Uyghur ([[Toquz Oghuz]]). After that, a smaller part of the Karluks joined the Uyghurs and settled in the [[Bogd Khan Uul|Bogdo-Ola]] mountains in [[Mongolia]], the larger part settled in the area between Altai and the eastern Tien Shan.<ref>N.Aristov, \"Usuns and Kyrgyzes, or Kara-Kyrgyzes\", Bishkek, 2001, pp. 246\u2013247</ref>\n\nIn 650, at the time of their submission to the Chinese, the Karluks had three tribes: '''Mouluo''' \u8b00\u843d / '''Moula''' \u8b00\u524c (''[[Bulaqs|Bulaq]]''?), '''Chisi''' \u71be\u4fdf (''Chigil''?) or '''Pofu''' \u5a46\u5310 / '''Posuo''' \u5a46\u5a11 /'''Suofu''' \u5a11\u5310 (''Sebe\u011f''?), and '''Tashili''' \u8e0f\u5be6\u529b (''Tashlyk''?)<ref>[https://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/karluk_yabgu_state_756940__309 \"Karluk Djabghu State (756-940)\"] ''Qazaqstan Tarihy''</ref><ref>Golden, Peter B.

The Arabs dislodged the Karluks from [[Fergana]].\n\nIn 766, after they overran the [[Turgesh]] in [[Zhetysu]], the Karluk tribes formed a [[Karluk yabghu|Khanate]] under the rule of a Yabgu, occupied [[Suyab]] and transferred their capital there.

They settled in the countryside and in the cities, which were centered on trading posts along the caravan roads. The Karluks inherited a vast multi-ethnic region, whose diverse population was not much different from its rulers. Zhetysu was populated by several tribes: the [[Az (people)|Azes]] mentioned in the Orkhon inscriptions, and the [[Tuhsi]], remnants of the [[T\u00fcrgesh]];<ref>Gumilyov, L.

The southern part of Zhetysu was occupied by the [[Yagma]] people, who also held [[Kashgar]]. In the north and west lived the [[Kankalis]]. A separate significant division of the Karluks were the [[Chigils]], a tribe that had detached from the Karluk.  They resided around [[Issyk Kul]].<ref name=\"87-92\" />\n\nThe diverse population adhered to a spectrum of religious beliefs. The Karluks and the majority of the Turkic population professed [[Tengrianism]], considered as [[shamanism]] and {{linktext|heathen}} by the Christians and Muslims. Chigils were [[Christians]] of the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] denomination. The majority of the Toquz Oghuz, with their khan, were [[Manicheans]], but there were also Christians, [[Buddhists]], and [[Muslims]] among them. The peaceful penetration of Muslim culture through commercial relations played a far more important role in their conversion than Muslim arms. The merchants were followed by missionaries of various creeds, including Nestorian Christians. Many Turkestan towns had Christian churches. The Turks held sacred the Qastek pass mountains, believing to be an abode of the deity. Each creed carried its script, resulting in a variety of used scripts, including [[Old Turkic script|T\u00fcrkic runiform]], [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], and later the [[Uyghur alphabet|Uygur]].<ref name=\"87-92\" /> The Karluks had adopted and developed the Turkic literary language of Khoresm, established in [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], which after Mongol conquest became known as the [[Chagatai language]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nOf all Turkic peoples, the Karluk were most open to the influence of Muslim culture. [[Tarikh al-Yaqubi|Yaqubi]] reported the conversion of the Karluk-yabgu to Islam under Caliph Mahdi (775&ndash;785), and by the 10th century, several towns to the east of Talas had mosques. Muslim culture had affected the general way of life of the Karluks.<ref>W. Barthold, \"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, p.91</ref>\n\nDuring the next three centuries, the [[Karluk yabghu|Karluk Yabgu state]] occupied a key position on the choice international trade route, fighting off mostly Turkic competitors to retain their prime position. Their biggest adversaries were [[Kangar people|Kangars]] in the north-west and [[Toquz Oghuz]] in the south-east, with a period of Samanid raids to [[Zhetysu]] in 840&ndash;894. But even in the heyday of the Karluk Yabgu state, parts of its domains were in the hands of the Toquz Oghuz, and later under [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Khitan people|Khitan]] control, increasing the ethnical, religious, and political diversity.<ref name=\"92-102\">W. Barthold, \"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, pp. 92\u2013102</ref>\n\n====Social organization====\nThe state of Karluk Yabgu was an association of semi-independent districts and cities, each equipped with its own [[militia]]. The biggest was the capital [[Suyab]], which could turn out 20,000 warriors, and among other districts, the town of Beglilig (known as \"Samakna\" before Karluk rule <ref name=\"88-89\">W. Barthold, \"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, pp. 88\u201389</ref>) had 10,000 warriors, [[Panjakent|Panjikat]] could turn out 8,000 warriors, [[Barskhan]] 6,000 warriors, and Yar 3,000 warriors. The titles of the petty rulers were Qutegin of the Karluk Laban clan in Karminkat, Taksin in Jil, Tabin-Barskhan in Barskhan, Turkic Yindl-Tegin and [[Sogdian people|Sogdian]] Badan-Sangu in Beglilig. The prince of Suyab, situated north of the Chu river in the Turgesh land, was a brother of one of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk khans, but bore the Persian title Yalan-shah, i.e. \"King of Heroes\".\n\nMuslim authors describe in detail the trade route from Western Asia to China across Zhetysu, mentioning many cities. Some bore double names, both Turkic and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]. They wrote about the capital cities of [[Balasagun]], [[Suyab]], and Kayalik, in which [[William of Rubruck]] saw three Buddhist temples in the Muslim town for the first time. The geographers also mentioned [[Taraz]] (Talas, Auliya-ata), [[Navakat]] (now Karabulak{{Clarify|date=August 2016}}), Atbash (now Koshoy-Kurgan ruins), [[Issyk-kul]], [[Barskhan]], [[Panjakent|Panjikat]], [[Akhsikat]], Beglilig, [[Olmaliq|Almalik]], Jul, Yar, Ton, Panchul, and others.<ref>{{cite book|first=W. |last=Barthold|title=Four Studies in History of Central Asia|location=Leiden|publisher= E. J. Brill|year= 1962|pages=50, 88}}</ref>\n\n===Kirghiz period===\nPrior to the Kirghiz-Uyghur war of 829&ndash;840, the [[Yenisei Kirghiz|Kirghiz]] lived in the upper basin of the [[Yenisei River]]. Linguistically their language, together with the [[Altai language]], belongs to a separate Kirghiz group of the Turkic language family. At that time they had an estimated population of 250,000 and an army of 50,000. Kirghiz victory in the war brought them to the Karluk door.  They captured [[Tuva]], [[Altai Republic|Altai]], a part of [[Dzungaria]], and reached [[Kashgar]]. Allied with the Karluks against the Uygurs, in the 840s the Kirghiz started the occupation of that part of [[Zhetysu]] which is their present home. Karluk independence ended around 840. They fell from dominating the tribal association to a subordinate position. The Kirghiz remained a power in Zhetysu until their destruction by the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate|Kara-Khitans]] in 1124, when most of them evacuated from their center in [[Tuva]] back to the [[Minusinsk Depression]],<ref name=\"92-102\" /> leaving the Karluks to predominate again in Zhetysu.\n\nThe position of the Karluk state, based on the rich Zhetysu cities, remained strong, despite the failures in wars in the beginning of the 9th century. Yabgu was enriched by profitable trade in slaves on the Syr-Darya slave markets, selling guards for the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphs]], and control over the transit road to China in the sector from [[Taraz]] to Issyk Kul. The Karluk position in Fergana, despite Arab attempts to expel them, became stronger.<ref>S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I.

For the first time in three hundred years, the powerful center of authority that created opportunities for expansion or even existence of any state in [[Turkestan]] had finally disappeared. Henceforth, the Turkic tribes recognized only the high status of the clan that inherited the Kagan title, but never again his unifying authority. Several Muslim historians state that after the loss by the Uygurs of their power (840), the supreme authority among the Turkic tribes passed to the Karluk leaders. Connection with the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan, the ruling clan of the Turkic Kaganate, allowed the Karluk dynasty to dress their authority with legitimate attire, and, abandoning the old title Yabgu, to take on the new title of Kagan.<ref>S.

In the 10th and 12th centuries, the lands on both sides of the principal chain of the Tian Shan were united under the rule of the Karakhanid Ilek-khans (Khans of the Land) or simply Karakhanids (Great Khans).

In 1137 near [[Khujand]] they defeated the Transoxanian Karakhanid ruler Mahmud Khan, who then appealed to their [[suzerain]] the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] for help. The Kara-Khitans, who were also invited by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmian]]s (then also a vassal of the Seljuks) to conquer the lands of the Seljuks as well as in response to an appeal to intervene by the Karluks who were involved in a conflict with the Karakhanids, then advanced to [[Samarkand]].

The Gurkhan's headquarters was called Khosun-ordu (lit. \"Strong Ordu\"), or Khoto (\"House\"). The Karluk capital was Kayalik. The Karakhanids continued to rule over Transoxania and western Xinjiang. The Kara-khitans did not interfere with the religion of the people, but Islam became less dominant as the other religions took advantage of the new freedom to increase the number of their adherents. The [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Patriarch Elias III (1176\u20131190) founded a religious metropole in [[Kashgar]]. The Karakhitay metropolitan bore the title Metropolitan of Kashghar and Navakat, showing that the see of Kashghar also controlled the southern part of Zhetysu.

The Karluks allied with the Tiele and their leaders the Uyghurs against the Turkic Kaganate, and participated in enthroning the victorious head of the Uyghur ([[Toquz Oghuz]]).

The Karluks and the majority of the Turkic population professed [[Tengrianism]], considered as [[shamanism]] and {{linktext|heathen}} by the Christians and Muslims. Chigils were [[Christians]] of the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] denomination. The majority of the Toquz Oghuz, with their khan, were [[Manicheans]], but there were also Christians, [[Buddhists]], and [[Muslims]] among them. The peaceful penetration of Muslim culture through commercial relations played a far more important role in their conversion than Muslim arms. The merchants were followed by missionaries of various creeds, including Nestorian Christians. Many Turkestan towns had Christian churches. The Turks held sacred the Qastek pass mountains, believing to be an abode of the deity. Each creed carried its script, resulting in a variety of used scripts, including [[Old Turkic script|T\u00fcrkic runiform]], [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], and later the [[Uyghur alphabet|Uygur]].<ref name=\"87-92\" /> The Karluks had adopted and developed the Turkic literary language of Khoresm, established in [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], which after Mongol conquest became known as the [[Chagatai language]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nOf all Turkic peoples, the Karluk were most open to the influence of Muslim culture. [[Tarikh al-Yaqubi|Yaqubi]] reported the conversion of the Karluk-yabgu to Islam under Caliph Mahdi (775&ndash;785), and by the 10th century, several towns to the east of Talas had mosques. Muslim culture had affected the general way of life of the Karluks.<ref>W. Barthold, \"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\", Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962, p.91</ref>\n\nDuring the next three centuries, the [[Karluk yabghu|Karluk Yabgu state]] occupied a key position on the choice international trade route, fighting off mostly Turkic competitors to retain their prime position. Their biggest adversaries were [[Kangar people|Kangars]] in the north-west and [[Toquz Oghuz]] in the south-east, with a period of Samanid raids to [[Zhetysu]] in 840&ndash;894. But even in the heyday of the Karluk Yabgu state, parts of its domains were in the hands of the Toquz Oghuz, and later under [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Khitan people|Khitan]] control, increasing the ethnical, religious, and political diversity.<ref name=\"92-102\">W.

The biggest was the capital [[Suyab]], which could turn out 20,000 warriors, and among other districts, the town of Beglilig (known as \"Samakna\" before Karluk rule <ref name=\"88-89\">W. Barthold, \"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\", Leiden, E. J.

The titles of the petty rulers were Qutegin of the Karluk Laban clan in Karminkat, Taksin in Jil, Tabin-Barskhan in Barskhan, Turkic Yindl-Tegin and [[Sogdian people|Sogdian]] Badan-Sangu in Beglilig. The prince of Suyab, situated north of the Chu river in the Turgesh land, was a brother of one of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk khans, but bore the Persian title Yalan-shah, i.e. \"King of Heroes\".\n\nMuslim authors describe in detail the trade route from Western Asia to China across Zhetysu, mentioning many cities. Some bore double names, both Turkic and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]. They wrote about the capital cities of [[Balasagun]], [[Suyab]], and Kayalik, in which [[William of Rubruck]] saw three Buddhist temples in the Muslim town for the first time.

Linguistically their language, together with the [[Altai language]], belongs to a separate Kirghiz group of the Turkic language family. At that time they had an estimated population of 250,000 and an army of 50,000. Kirghiz victory in the war brought them to the Karluk door.  They captured [[Tuva]], [[Altai Republic|Altai]], a part of [[Dzungaria]], and reached [[Kashgar]]. Allied with the Karluks against the Uygurs, in the 840s the Kirghiz started the occupation of that part of [[Zhetysu]] which is their present home. Karluk independence ended around 840. They fell from dominating the tribal association to a subordinate position. The Kirghiz remained a power in Zhetysu until their destruction by the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate|Kara-Khitans]] in 1124, when most of them evacuated from their center in [[Tuva]] back to the [[Minusinsk Depression]],<ref name=\"92-102\" /> leaving the Karluks to predominate again in Zhetysu.\n\nThe position of the Karluk state, based on the rich Zhetysu cities, remained strong, despite the failures in wars in the beginning of the 9th century. Yabgu was enriched by profitable trade in slaves on the Syr-Darya slave markets, selling guards for the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphs]], and control over the transit road to China in the sector from [[Taraz]] to Issyk Kul. The Karluk position in Fergana, despite Arab attempts to expel them, became stronger.<ref>S. G. Klyashtorny, T. I.

For the first time in three hundred years, the powerful center of authority that created opportunities for expansion or even existence of any state in [[Turkestan]] had finally disappeared. Henceforth, the Turkic tribes recognized only the high status of the clan that inherited the Kagan title, but never again his unifying authority. Several Muslim historians state that after the loss by the Uygurs of their power (840), the supreme authority among the Turkic tribes passed to the Karluk leaders. Connection with the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan, the ruling clan of the Turkic Kaganate, allowed the Karluk dynasty to dress their authority with legitimate attire, and, abandoning the old title Yabgu, to take on the new title of Kagan.<ref>S.

The Yagma ruler bore the title Bogra-khan (Camel Khan), very common among Karakhanids. The Yagma quickly proceeded to take control of all Karluk lands. In the 10th and 12th centuries, the lands on both sides of the principal chain of the Tian Shan were united under the rule of the Karakhanid Ilek-khans (Khans of the Land) or simply Karakhanids (Great Khans). The Karakhanid state was divided into fiefs which soon became independent.<ref>W. Barthold, \"Four Studies In History Of Central Asia\", Leiden, E. J.

His son Musa made Islam a state religion in 960. The empire occupied modern northern [[Iran]] and parts of Central Asia. This region remained under Karakhanid, and for varying periods it remained an independent vassal of [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] and [[Kara-Khitan Khanate|Kara-Khitan]]. The Karakhanid khanate ended when the last ruler of its western Khanate was killed by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmid]]s in 1212.  Both the Kara-Khitans and the Khwarezmids were later destroyed by the Mongol invasion.\n\nThe name Kh\u0101q\u0101niyya was given to the Qarluks who inhabited K\u0101shghar and B\u0101l\u0101s\u0101gh\u016bn, the inhabitants were not Uighur however their language has [[Uyghurs#Origin of the modern ethnic concept|been retroactively labelled as Uighur by scholars]].<ref name=\"K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fcLeiser2006\">{{cite book|author1=Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc|author2=Gary Leiser|author3=Robert Dankoff|title=Early Mystics in Turkish Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v6IWkCLnEwC&pg=PA158#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-36686-1|pages=158\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Khitan period===\n{{Main|Kara-Khitan Khanate}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 10th century, a tribe related to the Mongols, the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] with an admixture of Mongols, founded a vast empire, stretching from the [[Pacific]] to [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Tian Shan]], displacing the Turkic population.

In 1125, a [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic people]], the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], allied with the [[Southern Song]], ending the domination of the Khitan. The Khitan exiles, headed by Yel\u00fc Dashi, a member of the Khitan royal family, migrated to the West.<ref>{{cite book|first=W. |last=Barthold|title=Four Studies in History of Central Asia|location=Leiden|publisher= E.

The Khitan occupied Balasaghun, expelled the weak Karakhanid ruler, and founded their own state, which stretched from the Yenisei to [[Taraz]]. They then conquered Kankali and subdued [[Xinjiang]]. In 1137 near [[Khujand]] they defeated the Transoxanian Karakhanid ruler Mahmud Khan, who then appealed to their [[suzerain]] the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] for help. The Kara-Khitans, who were also invited by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmian]]s (then also a vassal of the Seljuks) to conquer the lands of the Seljuks as well as in response to an appeal to intervene by the Karluks who were involved in a conflict with the Karakhanids, then advanced to [[Samarkand]].  In 1141, the Seljuks under [[Ahmad Sanjar]] also arrived in Samarkand with his army, but was defeated by the Kara-Khitans in the [[Battle of Qatwan]], after which the Kara-Khitans became dominant in Transoxania.<ref>{{cite book |author=Biran, Michal. |title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 3 - The Fall: between the Khwarazm Shah and the Mongols |year=2005 |pages=41\u201343 |isbn= 0521842263 }}</ref>\n\nThe western Khitan state became known under its Turkic name, the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]] and their ruler bore the Turkic title Gurkhan \"Khan\u2019s son-in law\".<ref>{{cite book|first=W. |last=Barthold|title=Four Studies in History of Central Asia|location=Leiden|publisher= E.

Both in the west and east, Karluk principalities retained their autonomous status and indigenous rulers, though in Karakhitay the Karluk khan, like the ruler of Samarkand, was forced to accept the presence of a permanent representative of the Gurkhan.<ref>{{cite book|first=W. |last=Barthold|title=Four Studies in History of Central Asia|location=Leiden|publisher= E.

The Gurkhan's headquarters was called Khosun-ordu (lit. \"Strong Ordu\"), or Khoto (\"House\"). The Karluk capital was Kayalik. The Karakhanids continued to rule over Transoxania and western Xinjiang. The Kara-khitans did not interfere with the religion of the people, but Islam became less dominant as the other religions took advantage of the new freedom to increase the number of their adherents. The [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Patriarch Elias III (1176\u20131190) founded a religious metropole in [[Kashgar]]. The Karakhitay metropolitan bore the title Metropolitan of Kashghar and Navakat, showing that the see of Kashghar also controlled the southern part of Zhetysu. The oldest Nestorian tombs in the Tokmak and Pishpek cemeteries go back to the epoch of Karakhitay domination.  [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]] however stressed the oppression of Muslims by [[Kuchlug]], a son of the last  [[Nayman]] khan who was ousted (towards 1204) by Mongolia by [[Genghis Khan]]. The Nayman Nestorian Christian K\u00fcchl\u00fck usurped the throne of the Kara-Khitans.  In 1211, a Mongol detachment under the command of [[Khubilai Noyon]], one of Genghis Khan's generals, appeared in the northern part of Zhetysu. Arslan-khan Karluk killed the Karakhitay governor of Kayalik and proclaimed his loyalty to Genghis Khan.

The Karluk language was the primary basis for the later lingua-franca of the Chagatai Khanate and Central Asia under the [[Timurid dynasty]]. It is therefore designated by linguists and historians as the [[Chagatai language]], but its contemporaries, such as [[Timur]] and [[Babur]], simply called it ''Turki''.\n\n===Modern period===\nIn the 20th century, the geopolitical [[Great Game]] among great powers demanded the creation of modern [[nationalities]] among [[Central Asian]] Turks. The ethnonym \"Karluk\" was not revived. Instead, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] became the two major divisions among speakers of modern variants of the Chagatai language. Under these two modern nationalities, there are subgroups like the Uyghur [[Dolan people|Dolan]], [[Aynur]] and several regional populations of Uzbeks. Some of the Uzbeks share more similarities with [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] groups like the [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] and [[Kazakhs]], or with the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]], than with fellow Uzbeks who speak a descendant of the Karluk language.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n[Karluks are living in different countries outside central Asia as well, i.e. Karluks of Kashmir, and Karluk Turks of {Hazara}Haripur (Mankerai, Nartopa, Pharhari, Bayan Ahmed Ali Khan, Sarai Nehmat Khan, Shingri and lower Tanawal area, Abbottabad and Mansehra districts of Pakistan.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hazara-i-Karlugh]]\n*[[Karlugh Turks]] of Pakistan\n*[[Qarlughids]]\n*[[Bulaqs]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Z.

Norris meanwhile would have a strong race, finishing P6, earning McLaren's first points of the season.\n\nAt the 1000th Formula One Grand Prix race in [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], McLaren struggled in qualifying, with both cars getting eliminated in Q2, recording the first time McLaren's cars missed Q3 in the 2019 season. Sainz would start the race in P14 with Norris alongside him in P15. The race was worse for the team, as both cars would collide with [[Daniil Kvyat]] at turn 6 on the first lap, which dropped both of them to the last positions. Norris would later retire due to damage from the collision. The team left the Grand Prix with no points.\n\nNorris returned to Q3 in [[2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix|Azerbaijan]], qualifying in P7, while Sainz was knocked out again. He would, however, manage to rebound in the race, finishing in 7th after chasing [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] for the majority of the race. Norris would follow in P8.\n\n=== European and Canadian rounds ===\nMcLaren entered [[2019 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] with major upgrades to both cars, including revised barge boards, new engine cover, and a reshaped front wing, however both failed to reach Q3. Norris started in P10, and Sainz started in P12, after [[Daniel Ricciardo]] received a three-place grid penalty. On lap 44, Norris collided with [[Lance Stroll]] with both drivers retiring from the race. Sainz was able to take P8, and with it, put McLaren into 4th position in the Constructors' Championship.\n\nAt the [[2019 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], Sainz qualified in P9, while Norris was out in Q2, down in P12. On race day, Sainz would lose out to [[Alexander Albon]], falling to P10, but he would later execute a strong overtake, passing both [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] drivers on the outside line in turn 3 for P8. Sainz would continue his strong pace and eventually finish in P6. Norris, however, would have a quiet race in P11.\n\nMcLaren would have a difficult weekend in [[2019 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]]. Norris would qualify in P8, and Sainz would qualify in P9 This would become P11, however, as Sainz had to take a three-place grid penalty for impeding Albon. During the race on Sunday, Sainz had an overheating brake duct due to a visor tearoff getting stuck in the disc. He was immediately told to pit to the Hard tyres and to remove the tearoff, impacting his race and strategy. Sainz would be overtaken by [[Lance Stroll]] and Kvyat on the final stages of the race, falling to P11. Norris would retire from the race on the early stages of the race, suffering from overheating issues on his rear brakes. McLaren would score no points at the end of the Grand Prix.\n\nAt the following round in [[2019 French Grand Prix|France]], Norris and Sainz had equally strong qualifying sessions, qualifying in P5 and P6 respectively. Sainz's momentum would translate into the race, finishing in P6. As for Norris, he would see a strong performance, running comfortably in P7 up until the final lap, where he would suffer from hydraulic problems and gradually lose pace. He would then be passed by [[Daniel Ricciardo]] before turn 8 to take his position, however for Ricciardo, he ran deep into the corner, and forced Norris off whilst rejoining the circuit in turn 9. The incident allowed [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] past both drivers. On the following straight, Ricciardo went off-track to overtake the Finnish driver for position. He would later be handed two five-second penalties after the race for unsafely rejoining the track and gaining an advantage off track. Norris was elevated to P9 after Ricciardo's penalties. \n\nAt the [[2019 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], McLaren began the weekend strong, finishing in the top 10 in every practice session. However, in qualifying, despite Norris qualifying in P6, Sainz was forced to start from the last row of the grid as he exceeded his quota for power unit components. In the race, Sainz displayed consistently fast pace and charged towards the front of the field to convert his P19 start into a P8 finish. Norris had a strong start and briefly battled [[Lewis Hamilton]] for P3. He ended his race in P6, equalling his best result in Formula One.\n\nSainz continued his run of successful points finishes in [[2019 British Grand Prix|Britain]], going on to finish P6, despite qualifying in P13. He would manage to jump both [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] cars at the start, and fend off Ricciardo during the race to keep position. Norris struggled during the race and fell to P11 at the finish.\n\nAt the following round at the [[2019 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], heavy amounts of rain riddled with the strategies and caused a chaotic race. Sainz was caught out at turn 16 on lap 18, which caused him to run wide and aquaplane on the slippery drag strip area of the track before narrowly avoiding the barriers. Norris' car suffered a power loss on lap 26, prompting a deployment of the safety car. Many teams took the opportunity to enter the pits for a switch to dry weather tyres, however, Sainz and McLaren had decided otherwise, and instead switched to the intermediate weather tyres. Sainz was able to finish in P5 by the end of the race, his and the team's best result of the season. The result also raised McLaren's points total to 70, surpassing the previous year's total of 62 scored by [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] in the [[McLaren MCL33]].\n\nMcLaren would end the first half of the season on a high in [[2019 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], with both cars getting into Q3 and scoring much-needed points. Norris and teammate Sainz started in P7 and P8, respectively. At the start, Sainz managed to overtake Gasly and Norris, briefly threatening [[Sebastian Vettel]] on the entry of turn 2. Norris managed to finish the race in P9 and Sainz earned his second consecutive P5 finish, earning twelve points for McLaren.[[File:Lando_Norris,_Chinese_GP_2019.jpg|thumb|right|Lando Norris at the [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAfter the summer break, at the [[2019 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], Sainz had a fifteen-place grid penalty for exceeding the quota for power unit components. Immediately after the race started, his car stalled and he retired without crossing the start line. Norris was running fifth when on the penultimate lap, his car lost power. He would be classified 11th, outside of the points.\n\nThe [[2019 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] would fare slightly better for McLaren. Sainz managed to get into Q3, one of the only drivers to set a time in that session. Norris would be elimated in Q2, starting 16th after a grid penalty. The race would see Sainz's retirement after an error in fitting his right front tyre. Norris would fight his way through the grid to take 10th place and a solitary point for the team. Meanwhile, their closest rivals [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] would begin to catch up to McLaren, after recording a strong fourth and fifth, reducing McLaren's advantage to 18 points.\n\n=== Asian rounds ===\n\nIn [[2019 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]], the qualifying session would prove to be successful, with both Sainz and Norris making it into Q3, qualifying 7th and 9th respectively. On the opening lap of the race, at turn five Sainz and [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] would collide, puncturing their tyres and as a result, dropping Sainz to the back of the field. He would be called in to pit for the hard compound tyres. The mechanics would have trouble with the rear jack, causing Sainz to be stationary in the pits for over 40 seconds, which resulted in him coming out over a lap behind the leaders. Lando Norris would benefit this and gained 2 places, elevating him to P7. Sainz could only manage P12 after this, while Norris would finish 7th.\n\nIn the [[2019 Russian Grand Prix|Russian Grand Prix]], Sainz and Norris would have another successful qualifying session, qualifying P6 and P8 respectively. In the race, Sainz would overtake frontrunner [[Valtteri Bottas]] for fifth at the first corner on the opening lap. He lost that position on lap 7. Norris managed to keep his place to finish in P8 while Sainz finished in P6, which were the exact positions they started the race. The result would mean McLaren crossed 100 points in a season for the first time since [[2014 Formula One World Championship|2014]].\n\nIn [[Japan]], McLaren had both drivers enter Q3 for the third time in a row, Sainz starting in P7 and Norris P8. On lap 4 in the race, Red Bull driver [[Alexander Albon]] attempted to overtake Norris at turn 16, causing both to collide, which left Norris with floor damage and therefore impacting the car's pace. Norris also collected debris from [[Charles Leclerc]]'s earlier crash with [[Max Verstappen]], causing him to pit to avoid a brake fire. He would drop to the back of the field as a result of this. Sainz, who was in 4th place, lost a position on lap 26 in the pits when he emerged behind Albon. Sainz would go on to finish in P5, the third time he managed to get this result in 2019. Unfortunately, Norris would only manage to finish 11th. McLaren extended their advantage over Renault to 38 points. Sainz would overtake Toro Rosso driver [[Pierre Gasly]] in the driver's championship for P6.\n\n=== Closing rounds ===\n\nAfter three successful races in a row, the [[2019 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]] saw McLaren finish outside of the points. The weekend started well, with the drivers making it into Q3 for the fourth time in a row. The race would also start well, with Norris and Sainz making up a place each after frontrunners [[Lewis Hamilton]] and Max Verstappen made contact at turn 2 on the opening lap. Sainz, who was in fourth place, eventually lost a few positions to the frontrunners. On lap 13, Norris, who was in 7th place, pitted, however the mechanics failed to properly attach his front-left wheel. The pit crew managed to push the car back to the pit box before it was too late, however Norris would exit the pits in last place after 2 minutes, a lap down on the leaders. Norris eventually retired after he was in 19th place, 50 seconds behind the car ahead with no chance of scoring points. Sainz dropped down the field and finished a very disappointing P13. He would lose P6 in the championship to Gasly.\n\nIn the [[2019 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], McLaren returned to form as Sainz and Norris qualified P7 and P8. On the opening lap, Sainz and Albon collided into each other, with Sainz losing positions to Norris and Renault driver [[Daniel Ricciardo]]. Norris would gain a position after Ferrari driver [[Sebastian Vettel]] struggled to warm his tyres. Norris, who was P5, was passed by Ricciardo on lap 8. Albon managed to recover from his earlier incident with Sainz, dropping the McLaren drivers a position each. Norris and Sainz finished 7th and 8th respectively, Norris losing 6th place to Ricciardo by only 4 tenths of a second. Sainz would gain a position in the driver's championship after Gasly finished 16th, but he was passed by Albon.\n\nThe [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] would start off as disappointing for McLaren as Sainz encountered engine problems during Q1, while Norris was eliminated in Q2. In the race however, their fortunes would change entirely, as Sainz fought his way through the midfield (including Norris) on a risky one stop strategy. Various frontrunners retired during the race, prompting several safety car periods and bunching up the field. After Ferrari teammates Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel collided, punctured their wheels and retired, Sainz gained 2 positions and was now in P5. After the safety car ended, Lewis Hamilton crashed with Albon, with Sainz passing Albon for P4 and Norris finishing in P8. After the race, Hamilton was penalized 5 seconds for his earlier incident, elevating Sainz to 3rd place (as he was only 2.257 seconds behind Hamilton). However, Norris did not gain a position from Hamilton as he finished more than five seconds behind the latter. This would be McLaren's first podium since the [[2014 Australian Grand Prix]]. In addition, McLaren secured fourth in the Constructor's championship, 49 points clear of Renault. After Albon finished 14th, both Sainz and Gasly would pass him, and they were both on 95 points. However, Gasly finished 2nd in the race, so Gasly was currently P6 in the championship with Sainz 7th. \n\nIn [[2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]], both Sainz and Norris would make it to Q3, starting 7th and 9th respectively. In the race, the order would remain stable in the top 10 for the first few laps. Norris was the first of the drivers to make a scheduled pit stop, on lap 8. On lap 41, Sainz, who was running in P9, came for a second pit stop out of fear that his ageing tyres would allow him to be passed by rivals with fresher tyres. On the penultimate lap, Norris lost 7th place to [[Sergio Perez]], while on the last lap, Sainz managed to overtake Nico Hulkenberg for 10th, gaining a solitary point. This would prove to be vital, as this meant Sainz would overtake Gasly in the driver's championship, as Gasly finished 18th after a collision with [[Lance Stroll]]. Lando Norris finished 11th in the driver's championship as a result of Perez's overtake on him. If he had not been passed by Perez, he would have been 10th in the standings. Sainz's sixth place in the championship would be the first time since [[2015 Formula One World Championship|2015]] that a non-Mercedes, Ferrari, or Red Bull driver would finish higher than 7th in the standings.   \n\nThe MCL34 collected 145 points throughout the season, including a podium and four top 5 finishes. McLaren, who was fourth in the driver's championship, had their most successful season in the turbo-hybrid era so far. In fact, the points tally for the 2015, [[2016 Formula One World Championship|2016]] and [[2017 Formula One World Championship|2017]] seasons combined was smaller than the tally for 2019.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Complete Formula One results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 5|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Entrant\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Engine\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Tyres\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Drivers\n! colspan=\"21\" | Grands Prix\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Points\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{Tooltip|WCC|World Constructors' Championship position}}\n|-\n!

The race however was not successful, Norris contested for points, however he got held up by [[Antonio Giovinazzi]] which hampered his effort, he ended the race outside of the points in P12. Sainz retired on lap 9 with mechanical issues to his power unit.\n\nAt the next round in [[2019 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], both cars managed to get to Q3 for the first time since the [[2017 Malaysian Grand Prix]], with Sainz qualifying in 7th and Norris in P10, which later became P9, after [[Romain Grosjean]] received a three-place grid penalty for impeding Norris during qualifying. On race day, Sainz made a good start, making the jump on [[Kevin Magnussen]], and was contesting for P5. However, Sainz would suffer front wing damage on lap 4 after making contact with [[Max Verstappen]], and he had to pit as a result which dropped him to last place. He retired on the closing stages of the race with gearbox issues. Norris meanwhile would have a strong race, finishing P6, earning McLaren's first points of the season.\n\nAt the 1000th Formula One Grand Prix race in [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], McLaren struggled in qualifying, with both cars getting eliminated in Q2, recording the first time McLaren's cars missed Q3 in the 2019 season. Sainz would start the race in P14 with Norris alongside him in P15. The race was worse for the team, as both cars would collide with [[Daniil Kvyat]] at turn 6 on the first lap, which dropped both of them to the last positions. Norris would later retire due to damage from the collision. The team left the Grand Prix with no points.\n\nNorris returned to Q3 in [[2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix|Azerbaijan]], qualifying in P7, while Sainz was knocked out again. He would, however, manage to rebound in the race, finishing in 7th after chasing [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] for the majority of the race. Norris would follow in P8.\n\n=== European and Canadian rounds ===\nMcLaren entered [[2019 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] with major upgrades to both cars, including revised barge boards, new engine cover, and a reshaped front wing, however both failed to reach Q3. Norris started in P10, and Sainz started in P12, after [[Daniel Ricciardo]] received a three-place grid penalty. On lap 44, Norris collided with [[Lance Stroll]] with both drivers retiring from the race. Sainz was able to take P8, and with it, put McLaren into 4th position in the Constructors' Championship.\n\nAt the [[2019 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], Sainz qualified in P9, while Norris was out in Q2, down in P12. On race day, Sainz would lose out to [[Alexander Albon]], falling to P10, but he would later execute a strong overtake, passing both [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] drivers on the outside line in turn 3 for P8. Sainz would continue his strong pace and eventually finish in P6. Norris, however, would have a quiet race in P11.\n\nMcLaren would have a difficult weekend in [[2019 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]]. Norris would qualify in P8, and Sainz would qualify in P9 This would become P11, however, as Sainz had to take a three-place grid penalty for impeding Albon. During the race on Sunday, Sainz had an overheating brake duct due to a visor tearoff getting stuck in the disc. He was immediately told to pit to the Hard tyres and to remove the tearoff, impacting his race and strategy. Sainz would be overtaken by [[Lance Stroll]] and Kvyat on the final stages of the race, falling to P11. Norris would retire from the race on the early stages of the race, suffering from overheating issues on his rear brakes. McLaren would score no points at the end of the Grand Prix.\n\nAt the following round in [[2019 French Grand Prix|France]], Norris and Sainz had equally strong qualifying sessions, qualifying in P5 and P6 respectively. Sainz's momentum would translate into the race, finishing in P6. As for Norris, he would see a strong performance, running comfortably in P7 up until the final lap, where he would suffer from hydraulic problems and gradually lose pace. He would then be passed by [[Daniel Ricciardo]] before turn 8 to take his position, however for Ricciardo, he ran deep into the corner, and forced Norris off whilst rejoining the circuit in turn 9. The incident allowed [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] past both drivers. On the following straight, Ricciardo went off-track to overtake the Finnish driver for position. He would later be handed two five-second penalties after the race for unsafely rejoining the track and gaining an advantage off track. Norris was elevated to P9 after Ricciardo's penalties. \n\nAt the [[2019 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], McLaren began the weekend strong, finishing in the top 10 in every practice session. However, in qualifying, despite Norris qualifying in P6, Sainz was forced to start from the last row of the grid as he exceeded his quota for power unit components. In the race, Sainz displayed consistently fast pace and charged towards the front of the field to convert his P19 start into a P8 finish. Norris had a strong start and briefly battled [[Lewis Hamilton]] for P3. He ended his race in P6, equalling his best result in Formula One.\n\nSainz continued his run of successful points finishes in [[2019 British Grand Prix|Britain]], going on to finish P6, despite qualifying in P13. He would manage to jump both [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] cars at the start, and fend off Ricciardo during the race to keep position. Norris struggled during the race and fell to P11 at the finish.\n\nAt the following round at the [[2019 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], heavy amounts of rain riddled with the strategies and caused a chaotic race. Sainz was caught out at turn 16 on lap 18, which caused him to run wide and aquaplane on the slippery drag strip area of the track before narrowly avoiding the barriers. Norris' car suffered a power loss on lap 26, prompting a deployment of the safety car. Many teams took the opportunity to enter the pits for a switch to dry weather tyres, however, Sainz and McLaren had decided otherwise, and instead switched to the intermediate weather tyres. Sainz was able to finish in P5 by the end of the race, his and the team's best result of the season. The result also raised McLaren's points total to 70, surpassing the previous year's total of 62 scored by [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] in the [[McLaren MCL33]].\n\nMcLaren would end the first half of the season on a high in [[2019 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], with both cars getting into Q3 and scoring much-needed points. Norris and teammate Sainz started in P7 and P8, respectively. At the start, Sainz managed to overtake Gasly and Norris, briefly threatening [[Sebastian Vettel]] on the entry of turn 2. Norris managed to finish the race in P9 and Sainz earned his second consecutive P5 finish, earning twelve points for McLaren.[[File:Lando_Norris,_Chinese_GP_2019.jpg|thumb|right|Lando Norris at the [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAfter the summer break, at the [[2019 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], Sainz had a fifteen-place grid penalty for exceeding the quota for power unit components. Immediately after the race started, his car stalled and he retired without crossing the start line. Norris was running fifth when on the penultimate lap, his car lost power. He would be classified 11th, outside of the points.\n\nThe [[2019 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] would fare slightly better for McLaren. Sainz managed to get into Q3, one of the only drivers to set a time in that session. Norris would be elimated in Q2, starting 16th after a grid penalty. The race would see Sainz's retirement after an error in fitting his right front tyre. Norris would fight his way through the grid to take 10th place and a solitary point for the team. Meanwhile, their closest rivals [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] would begin to catch up to McLaren, after recording a strong fourth and fifth, reducing McLaren's advantage to 18 points.\n\n=== Asian rounds ===\n\nIn [[2019 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]], the qualifying session would prove to be successful, with both Sainz and Norris making it into Q3, qualifying 7th and 9th respectively. On the opening lap of the race, at turn 5 Sainz and [[Nico Hulkenberg]] would collide, puncturing their tyres and as a result, dropping Sainz to the back of the field. He would be called in to pit for the hard compound tyres. The mechanics would have trouble with the rear jack, causing Sainz to be stationary in the pits for over 40 seconds, which resulted in him coming out over a lap behind the leaders. Lando Norris would benefit this and gained 2 places, elevating him to P7. Sainz could only manage P12 after this, while Norris would finish 7th.\n\nIn the [[2019 Russian Grand Prix|Russian Grand Prix]], Sainz and Norris would have another successful qualifying session, qualifying P6 and P8 respectively. In the race, Sainz would overtake frontrunner [[Valtteri Bottas]] for fifth at the first corner on the opening lap. He lost that position on lap 7. Norris managed to keep his place to finish in P8 while Sainz finished in P6, which were the exact positions they started the race. The result would mean Mclaren crossed 100 points in a season for the first time since [[2014 Formula One World Championship|2014]].\n\nIn [[Japan]], Mclaren had both drivers enter Q3 for the third time in a row, Sainz starting in P7 and Norris P8. On lap 4 in the race, Red Bull driver [[Alexander Albon]] attempted to overtake Norris at turn 16, causing both to collide, which left Norris with floor damage and therefore impacting the car's pace. Norris also collected debris from [[Charles Leclerc]]'s earlier crash with [[Max Verstappen]], causing him to pit to avoid a brake fire. He would drop to the back of the field as a result of this. Sainz, who was in 4th place, lost a position on lap 26 in the pits when he emerged behind Albon. Sainz would go on to finish in P5, the third time he managed to get this result in 2019. Unfortunately, Norris would only manage to finish 11th. Mclaren extended their advantage over Renault to 38 points. Sainz would overtake Toro Rosso driver [[Pierre Gasly]] in the driver's championship for P6.\n\n=== Closing rounds ===\n\nAfter three successful races in a row, the [[2019 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]] saw Mclaren finish outside of the points. The weekend started well, with the drivers making it into Q3 for the fourth time in a row. The race would also start well, with Norris and Sainz making up a place each after frontrunners [[Lewis Hamilton]] and Max Verstappen made contact at turn 2 on the opening lap. Sainz, who was in fourth place, eventually lost a few positions to the frontrunners. On lap 13, Norris, who was in 7th place, pitted, however the mechanics failed to properly attach his front-left wheel. The pit crew managed to push the car back to the pit box before it was too late, however Norris would exit the pits in last place after 2 minutes, a lap down on the leaders. Norris eventually retired after he was in 19th place, 50 seconds behind the car ahead with no chance of scoring points. Sainz dropped down the field and finished a very disappointing P13. He would lose P6 in the championship to Gasly.\n\nIn the [[2019 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], Mclaren returned to form as Sainz and Norris qualified P7 and P8. On the opening lap, Sainz and Albon collided into each other, with Sainz losing positions to Norris and Renault driver [[Daniel Ricciardo]]. Norris would gain a position after Ferrari driver [[Sebastian Vettel]] struggled to warm his tyres. Norris, who was P5, was passed by Ricciardo on lap 8. Albon managed to recover from his earlier incident with Sainz, dropping the Mclaren drivers a position each. Norris and Sainz finished 7th and 8th respectively, Norris losing 6th place to Ricciardo by only 4 tenths of a second. Sainz would gain a position in the driver's championship after Gasly finished 16th, but he was passed by Albon.\n\nThe [[2019 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] would start off as disappointing for Mclaren as Sainz encountered engine problems during Q1, while Norris was eliminated in Q2. In the race however, their fortunes would change entirely, as Sainz fought his way through the midfield (including Norris) on a risky one stop strategy. Various frontrunners retired during the race, prompting several safety car periods and bunching up the field. After Ferrari teammates Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel collided, punctured their wheels and retired, Sainz gained 2 positions and was now in P5. After the safety car ended, Lewis Hamilton crashed with Albon, with Sainz passing Albon for P4 and Norris finishing in P8. After the race, Hamilton was penalized 5 seconds for his earlier incident, elevating Sainz to 3rd place (as he was only 2.257 seconds behind Hamilton). However, Norris did not gain a position from Hamilton as he finished more than five seconds behind the latter. This would be Mclaren's first podium since the [[2014 Australian Grand Prix]]. In addition, Mclaren secured fourth in the Constructor's championship, 49 points clear of Renault. After Albon finished 14th, both Sainz and Gasly would pass him, and they were both on 95 points. However, Gasly finished 2nd in the race, so Gasly was currently P6 in the championship with Sainz 7th. \n\nIn [[2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi]], both Sainz and Norris would make it to Q3, starting 7th and 9th respectively. In the race, the order would remain stable in the top 10 for the first few laps. Norris was the first of the drivers to make a scheduled pit stop, on lap 8. On lap 41, Sainz, who was running in P9, came for a second pit stop out of fear that his ageing tyres would allow him to be passed by rivals with fresher tyres. On the penultimate lap, Norris lost 7th place to [[Sergio Perez]], while on the last lap, Sainz managed to overtake Nico Hulkenberg for 10th, gaining a solitary point. This would prove to be vital, as this meant Sainz would overtake Gasly in the driver's championship, as Gasly finished 18th after a collision with [[Lance Stroll]]. Lando Norris finished 11th in the driver's championship as a result of Perez's overtake on him. If he had not been passed by Perez, he would have been 10th in the standings. Sainz's sixth place in the championship would be the first time since [[2015 Formula One World Championship|2015]] that a non-Mercedes, Ferrari, or Red Bull driver would finish higher than 7th in the standings.   \n\nThe MCL34 collected 145 points throughout the season, including a podium and four top 5 finishes. Mclaren, who was fourth in the driver's championship, had their most successful season in the turbo-hybrid era so far. In fact, the points tally for the 2015, [[2016 Formula One World Championship|2016]] and [[2017 Formula One World Championship|2017]] seasons combined was smaller than the tally for 2019.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Complete Formula One results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 5|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Entrant\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Engine\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Tyres\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Drivers\n! colspan=\"21\" | Grands Prix\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Points\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{Tooltip|WCC|World Constructors' Championship position}}\n|-\n!
