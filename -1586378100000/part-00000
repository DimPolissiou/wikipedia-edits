This group included the leading figures of the [[Gaelic League]] founded by the future first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]]. Although formally apolitical and concerned with the preservation of the Irish language and culture, the league brought together many patriots and future political leaders. Sarah Purser, whom the young Gore-Booth sisters first met in 1882, when she was commissioned to paint their portrait, hosted a regular salon where artists, writers and intellectuals on both sides of the nationalist divide gathered. At Purser's house, Markievicz met revolutionary patriots [[Michael Davitt]], [[John O'Leary (Fenian)|John O'Leary]] and [[Maud Gonne]]. In 1907, Markievicz rented a cottage in the countryside near Dublin. The previous tenant, the poet [[Padraic Colum]], had left behind copies of ''The Peasant'' and ''Sinn F\u00e9in''. These revolutionary journals promoted independence from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] rule.

Markievicz came directly to her first meeting from a function at [[Dublin Castle]], the seat of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] rule in Ireland, wearing a satin ball-gown and a diamond tiara. Naturally, the members looked upon her with some hostility. This refreshing change from being \"[[kowtow]]ed\"-to as a countess only made her more eager to join.{{Citation needed|reason=How do we know she found this refreshing?|date=March 2016}} She performed with Maud Gonne in several plays at the newly established [[Abbey Theatre]], an institution that played an important part in the rise of cultural nationalism. In the same year, Markievicz played a dramatic role in the women's suffrage campaigners' tactic of opposing [[Winston Churchill]]'s election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] during the [[1908 Manchester North West by-election|Manchester North West by-election]], flamboyantly appearing in the constituency driving an old-fashioned carriage drawn by four white horses to promote the suffragist cause. A male heckler asked her if she could cook a dinner, to which she responded, \"Yes. Can you drive a coach and four?\" Her sister Eva had moved to Manchester to live with fellow suffragette [[Esther Roper]] and they both campaigned against Churchill with her.

Their father's example inspired in Gore-Booth and her younger sister, [[Eva Gore-Booth]], a deep concern for working people and the poor. The sisters were childhood friends of the poet [[W. B. Yeats]], who frequently visited the family home Lissadell House, and were influenced by his artistic and political ideas. Yeats wrote a poem, \"[[In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markiewicz]]\", in which he described the sisters as \"two girls in silk kimonos, both beautiful, one a gazelle\" (the gazelle being Constance).<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Rosemary |last=Rodgers |title=The Rebel Countess |magazine=[[Irish America (magazine)|Irish America]] |at=June/July 2015. pp. 42\u20133 |date=11 May 2015 |url=https://issuu.com/irishamerica/docs/ia_june_july_2015 |accessdate=22 November 2018|via=[[issuu]]}}{{break}}{{cite web | first=Rosemary |last=Rodgers |title=The Rebel Countess |website=[[Irish America (magazine)|Irish America]] |at=June/July 2015 |date=13 May 2015 |url=https://irishamerica.com/2015/05/the-rebel-countess/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |via=Irish America website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123130609/https://irishamerica.com/2015/05/the-rebel-countess/ |archive-date=23 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Eva later became involved in the [[labour movement]] and [[women's suffrage]] in Great Britain, although initially Constance did not share her sister's ideals.\n\nIn 1921, during the [[Treaty debates]], Markievicz claimed that she had been raised by an uncle in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] who was a \"[[Fenian Rising|'67 man]]\", and from whom she had got her republicanism.'<ref>[https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-17/1/ Dail debates, 17 December 1921]</ref>\n\n== Marriage and early politics ==\nGore-Booth decided to train as a painter, but at the time only one art school in Dublin accepted women students.

This group included the leading figures of the [[Gaelic League]] founded by the future first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]]. Although formally apolitical and concerned with the preservation of the Irish language and culture, the league brought together many patriots and future political leaders. Sarah Purser, whom the young Gore-Booth sisters first met in 1882, when she was commissioned to paint their portrait, hosted a regular salon where artists, writers and intellectuals on both sides of the nationalist divide gathered. At Purser's house, Markievicz met revolutionary patriots [[Michael Davitt]], [[John O'Leary (Fenian)|John O'Leary]] and [[Maud Gonne]]. In 1907, Markievicz rented a cottage in the countryside near Dublin. The previous tenant, the poet [[Padraic Colum]], had left behind copies of ''The Peasant'' and ''Sinn F\u00e9in''. These revolutionary journals promoted independence from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] rule. Markievicz read these publications and was propelled into action.<ref>Anne Haverty, Constance Markievicz: Irish Revolutionary (Liiliput Press: Dublin, 2016), pp. 73-74.</ref>\n\n[[File:Constance Markievicz statue by Elizabeth McLaughlin (01).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sculpture of Markievicz and her cocker spaniel, Poppet, on Townsend Street, Dublin]]\n[[File:Constance Markiewicz by John Butler Yeats.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketch of Markievicz by [[John Butler Yeats]]]]\n[[File:countessmarkieviczandchildren.jpg|thumb|upright|Markievicz with her daughter and stepson]]\nIn 1908, Markievicz became actively involved in nationalist politics in Ireland. She joined [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and [[Inghinidhe na h\u00c9ireann]] ('Daughters of Ireland'), a revolutionary women's movement founded by the actress and activist [[Maud Gonne]], muse of [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]]. Markievicz came directly to her first meeting from a function at [[Dublin Castle]], the seat of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] rule in Ireland, wearing a satin ball-gown and a diamond tiara. Naturally, the members looked upon her with some hostility. This refreshing change from being \"[[kowtow]]ed\"-to as a countess only made her more eager to join.{{Citation needed|reason=How do we know she found this refreshing?|date=March 2016}} She performed with Maud Gonne in several plays at the newly established [[Abbey Theatre]], an institution that played an important part in the rise of cultural nationalism. In the same year, Markievicz played a dramatic role in the women's suffrage campaigners' tactic of opposing [[Winston Churchill]]'s election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] during the [[1908 Manchester North West by-election|Manchester North West by-election]], flamboyantly appearing in the constituency driving an old-fashioned carriage drawn by four white horses to promote the suffragist cause. A male heckler asked her if she could cook a dinner, to which she responded, \"Yes. Can you drive a coach and four?\" Her sister Eva had moved to Manchester to live with fellow suffragette [[Esther Roper]] and they both campaigned against Churchill with her. Churchill lost the election to Conservative candidate [[William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford|William Joynson-Hicks]], in part as a result of the suffragists' dedicated opposition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marecco|first=Anne|title=The Rebel Countess|year=1967|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909 Markievicz and [[Bulmer Hobson]] founded [[Fianna \u00c9ireann]], a [[para-military]] nationalist scouting organisation that instructed teenage boys in the use of firearms. At its first meeting in [[Camden Street, Dublin]], on 16 August 1909, she was almost expelled on the basis that women did not belong in a physical force movement, but Hobson supported her, and she was elected to the committee.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Townshend|first1=Charles|title=Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-190276-0|pages=21\u20132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FNKxBJXMYC|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref> She was jailed for the first time in 1911 for speaking at an [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] demonstration attended by 30,000 people, organised to protest against [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]'s visit to Ireland.

Set in an alternative future where a [[Nordicism|Nordic supremacist]] and [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] Christian [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime has subjugated the [[United Kingdom]], the film centers on [[V (character)|V]] (portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]]), an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, while [[Natalie Portman]] plays [[Evey Hammond|Evey]], a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission and [[Stephen Rea]] portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.\n\nProduced by [[Silver Pictures]], [[Virtual Studios]] and [[The Wachowskis#As film producers and comic book publishers|Anarchos Productions Inc.]], ''V for Vendetta'' was originally scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] on November 4, 2005 (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on March 17, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(2003), declined to watch the film and asked to be uncredited or not be paid royalties.\n\n''V for Vendetta'' has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; [[libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]] have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \"The [[Guy Fawkes mask]] has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny \u2013 and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735|title=V for Vendetta masks: Who\u2019s behind them?|last=Waites|first=Rosie|date=October 20, 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2032, the world is in turmoil: The United States is presumed to have fractured or fallen from the world stage and the United Kingdom is ruled by the [[Fascism|fascist]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quicklet On V for Vendetta By Alan Moore|last=Muise|first=Chris|publisher=Hyperink, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-1614640844|pages=1\u201310|quote=Britain, however, survives under the cold, watchful eye of the Norsefire government, a fascist regime that took control amidst the chaos and confusion after the war.}}</ref> [[Norsefire]] Party, under High Chancellor [[Adam Susan|Adam Sutler]].\n\nOn November 4, a vigilante in a [[Guy Fawkes]] mask, \"[[V (character)|V]]\", rescues [[Evey Hammond]], an employee of state-run British Television Network, from members of the \"Fingermen\" [[secret police]]. They watch his demolition of the [[Old Bailey]], accompanied by fireworks and the \"[[1812 Overture]]\". Inspector Finch of [[Scotland Yard]] investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's [[Guy Fawkes Night]] outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.\n\nV takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the [[Bishop of London]].<!-- Before claiming the bishop is a pedophile you need a citation. Pedophilia is sexual attraction primarily or exclusively towards prepubescents, typically around 13 years old. The dialogue from the aide says that Evey is \"a little older than usual\". Natalie Portman was about 24 during filming and cannot pass for a prepubescent girl. --> Evey offers to help, but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and other \"undesirables\" at [[Larkhill]] concentration camp; seeing her remorse, he kills her painlessly.\n\nAfter Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V captured her at Gordon's home, staging her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He informs her that Gordon was executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.\n\nReading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a [[biological warfare|bioweapons]] program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, [[Secretary of State for Defence|Secretary of Defence]] at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a [[London Underground|tube station]] and a [[water treatment]] plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people. The outbreak was blamed on a [[terrorist organisation]]. Norsefire used the wave of fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], taking control of the country, as well as profiting off the cure for the virus. Finch discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is shaken.\n\nAs November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, while the population questions government rule. The UK descends into anarchy, ignited when a Fingerman shoots and kills a girl painting graffiti, only to be killed in turn by enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with [[ANFO]] explosives in the abandoned [[London Underground]], set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal, killing Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V tells Evey he loves her before dying.\n\nAs Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. As Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the [[British Armed Forces|military]] receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \"He was all of us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n\n[[File:HugoWeavingMay2011.jpg|thumb|Hugo Weaving in 2012.

Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Arabs and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. (This fact owes to the post-9/11 association of Islam and the Middle East with terrorism, combined with the fact that British Muslims far outnumber British Jews. The latter are certainly persecuted by Norsefire as well, since Norsefire is an Aryanist regime as well as a Christofascistic one.)

Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]].

The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].<ref name=\"Unmasked\">{{cite video | people=Warner Bros |year=2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref> The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] and statues by [[Giacometti]].\nOne of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.<ref name=\"About the Production\">{{cite web| work=Official website | title=V for Vendetta&nbsp;\u2014 About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between the film and graphic novel==\nThe film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel ''V for Vendetta''; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Itzcoff | first = Dave | title = The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date =March 12, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html | accessdate =April 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThere are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set in 2032: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern [[United States|US]] political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist\u2013fascist themes. Moore states that \"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<ref name=\"official production\" /> Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the \"St. Mary's virus\", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMany of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |title=V for Vendetta the Page Vs. The Screen |accessdate=June 26, 2010 | url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221050/http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}</ref> However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a [[Quran]] is found in his possession.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5, 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \"Remember, remember the 5th of November\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17, 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and the failed [[21 July 2005 London bombings|July 21 bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Scott|title=C is for controversy|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/|work=scifi.com|publisher=SCI FI|accessdate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101022910/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/ |archivedate=January 1, 2008}}</ref> The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production.<ref name=\"Postponed\">{{Cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Natalie Portman's 'V for Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?entry_id=452 | accessdate=April 25, 2006 | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=August 23, 2005}}</ref> ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on December 11, 2005, at [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]], followed by a premiere on February 13, 2006 at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].<ref name=numb /><ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" /> It opened for general release on March 17, 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion===\nThe cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message.

It was a response to living in [[Thatcherite]] Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today.

Set in an alternative future where a [[Nordicism|Nordic supremacist]] and [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] Christian [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime has subjugated the [[United Kingdom]], the film centers on [[V (character)|V]] (portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]]), an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, while [[Natalie Portman]] plays [[Evey Hammond|Evey]], a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission and [[Stephen Rea]] portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.\n\nProduced by [[Silver Pictures]], [[Virtual Studios]] and [[The Wachowskis#As film producers and comic book publishers|Anarchos Productions Inc.]], ''V for Vendetta'' was originally scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] on November 4, 2005 (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on March 17, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(2003), declined to watch the film and asked to be uncredited or not be paid royalties.\n\n''V for Vendetta'' has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; [[libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]] have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \"The [[Guy Fawkes mask]] has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny \u2013 and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735|title=V for Vendetta masks: Who\u2019s behind them?|last=Waites|first=Rosie|date=October 20, 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2032, the world is in turmoil.

They watch his demolition of the [[Old Bailey]], accompanied by fireworks and the \"[[1812 Overture]]\". Inspector Finch of [[Scotland Yard]] investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's [[Guy Fawkes Night]] outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.\n\nV takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the [[Bishop of London]].<!-- Before claiming the bishop is a pedophile you need a citation. Pedophilia is sexual attraction primarily or exclusively towards prepubescents, typically around 13 years old. The dialogue from the aide says that Evey is \"a little older than usual\". Natalie Portman was about 24 during filming and cannot pass for a prepubescent girl. --> Evey offers to help, but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and other \"undesirables\" at [[Larkhill]] concentration camp; seeing her remorse, he kills her painlessly.\n\nAfter Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V captured her at Gordon's home, staging her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He informs her that Gordon was executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.\n\nReading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a [[biological warfare|bioweapons]] program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, [[Secretary of State for Defence|Secretary of Defence]] at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a [[London Underground|tube station]] and a [[water treatment]] plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people. The outbreak was blamed on a [[terrorist organisation]]. Norsefire used the wave of fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], taking control of the country, as well as profiting off the cure for the virus. Finch discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is shaken.\n\nAs November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, while the population questions government rule. The UK descends into anarchy, ignited when a Fingerman shoots and kills a girl painting graffiti, only to be killed in turn by enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with [[ANFO]] explosives in the abandoned [[London Underground]], set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal, killing Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V tells Evey he loves her before dying.\n\nAs Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. As Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the [[British Armed Forces|military]] receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \"He was all of us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n\n[[File:HugoWeavingMay2011.jpg|thumb|Hugo Weaving in 2012.

Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Arabs and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. (This fact owes to the post-9/11 association of Islam and the Middle East with terrorism, combined with the fact that British Muslims far outnumber British Jews. The latter are certainly persecuted by Norsefire as well, since Norsefire is an Aryanist regime as well as a Christofascistic one.)

Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]]. Filming began in early March 2005 and lasted through early June 2005.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> ''V for Vendetta'' is the final film shot by [[cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]], who died of a heart attack on December 7, 2005, 4 days prior to its world debut.<ref>Guard, Howard\n[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/19/guardianobituaries.film Adrian Biddle obituary], www.guardian.co.uk, January 18, 2006.

The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].<ref name=\"Unmasked\">{{cite video | people=Warner Bros |year=2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref> The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] and statues by [[Giacometti]].\nOne of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.<ref name=\"About the Production\">{{cite web| work=Official website | title=V for Vendetta&nbsp;\u2014 About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between the film and graphic novel==\nThe film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel ''V for Vendetta''; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Itzcoff | first = Dave | title = The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date =March 12, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html | accessdate =April 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThere are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set in 2032: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern [[United States|US]] political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist\u2013fascist themes. Moore states that \"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<ref name=\"official production\" /> Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the \"St. Mary's virus\", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMany of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |title=V for Vendetta the Page Vs. The Screen |accessdate=June 26, 2010 | url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221050/http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}</ref> However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a [[Quran]] is found in his possession.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5, 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \"Remember, remember the 5th of November\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17, 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and the failed [[21 July 2005 London bombings|July 21 bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Scott|title=C is for controversy|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/|work=scifi.com|publisher=SCI FI|accessdate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101022910/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/ |archivedate=January 1, 2008}}</ref> The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production.<ref name=\"Postponed\">{{Cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Natalie Portman's 'V for Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?entry_id=452 | accessdate=April 25, 2006 | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=August 23, 2005}}</ref> ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on December 11, 2005, at [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]], followed by a premiere on February 13, 2006 at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].<ref name=numb /><ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" /> It opened for general release on March 17, 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion===\nThe cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: \"Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in [[Thatcherite]] Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities.\" Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.<ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" />\n\n===Books===\nThe original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005.<ref>{{ASIN|1401207928|title=V for Vendetta [Hardcover]}} {{ISBN|978-1-4012-0792-2}}</ref> The film renewed interest in Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.<ref name=\"Televisionpoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410|title=V for Vendetta graphic novel is a US Bestseller|date=March 31, 2006|work=televisionpoint.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119122204/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410|archivedate=November 19, 2006|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}</ref>\n\nA novelisation of the film, written by [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] and based on the Wachowskis' script, was published by [[Pocket Star]] on January 31, 2006.<ref>{{ASIN|1416516999|title=V for Vendetta: a Novelization}} {{ISBN|978-1416516996}}</ref> Spencer Lamm, who has worked with the Wachowskis, created a \"[[Making-of|behind-the-scenes]]\" book.

Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: \"This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution.

She began horseback riding with her sister at Oak Meadows Farm when she was 8 years old. By age 9, she was learning to jump. At 11 years old, Brain got her first horse, Patty, a 15.3 hh chestnut [[Thoroughbred]]. A year and a half later, Brain sold Patty and purchased Pumpkin, an [[American Quarter Horse]]. Brain continued to advance on Pumpkin, earning ribbons in various classes. In 1983, Brain met Alpine Renegade (Alpo), a 6 year old 15 hh gelding. The two had early successes, leading Brain to buy him in 1983. In 1984, Brain was deeply immersed in horseback riding, working and riding at Spring Ride Farm. She began eventing on Alpo, winning her first pre-training event in 1985 in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. In 1987, Brain participated in the [[Western Canada Summer Games]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]. She placed fifth in preliminary-level three day eventing. In 1988, at age 18, Brain moved to Ontario and began working for Nick Holmes-Smith. In November 1988, Brain was selected for a scholarship to train with [[Mark Phillips]] in [[England]]. In February 1989, Brain and Alpo flew to England. In April 1989, Brain's horse Alpo was injured at the Gatwick Horse Trials. This injury highlighted Alpo's limitations as a small horse. When Brain returned to Canada and began to seriously prepare for the Olympics, she made the decision to sell Alpo.

[[Rockstar Games]] released the game in September 2012 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], in November 2014 for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], and in April 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], as the fifteenth entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. Development began soon after ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''{{'}}s release and was led by [[Rockstar North]]'s core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a [[spiritual successor]] to many of their previous projects like ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and ''[[Max Payne 3]]''. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, [[viral marketing]] strategies and [[special edition]]s. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.\n\nThe game's [[open world]] setting was modelled on [[Los Angeles]] and other areas of [[Southern California]]. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and the proprietary [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE) was overhauled to increase its [[draw distance]] rendering capabilities. Key team members conducted field trips around Southern California to gather research and footage, and [[Google Maps]] projections of Los Angeles were used to help design the city's road networks. For the first time in the series, [[player character|players control]] three protagonists throughout the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode. The team found the multiple protagonist design a fundamental change to the gameplay and narrative devices. They refined the shooting and driving mechanics and tightened the narrative's pacing and scope.\n\nThe actors selected to portray the protagonists invested much time and research into character development. [[Motion capture]] was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game is the first in its series to feature an [[Music of Grand Theft Auto V|original score]], composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added [[First-person (video games)|first-person view]] option along with the traditional [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]]. To accommodate first-person, the game received a major visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== History and overview ===\n[[Image:Grand Theft Auto V development.jpg|thumb|right|The developers overhauled the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] to render [[Particle system|particle effects]] with greater detail than in ''Grand Theft Auto IV''|alt=The player character parachuting in a mountainous valley.

Their work was mostly complete later in development, but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. [[Edgar Froese]], Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria, but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\nJackson's initial role was to provide the score for Trevor's missions, and he took influence from artists such as [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other's work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, however, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. \"Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing\", Jackson said.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Froese had interpolated [[funk]] sounds with Jackson's [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] it. The Alchemist opined, \"We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there&nbsp;...&nbsp;We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> [[DJ Shadow]] then mixed the team's creations and matched it to the gameplay.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich considered \"how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score\" a challenge.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\n[[Image:Flying-Lotus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Flying Lotus]] hosts, and composed original music for, the in-game FlyLo FM radio station|alt=]]\n\nPavlovich found that while Rockstar assigned the team missions to write music for, some of their random creations influenced other missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. He discussed a \"stem-based\" system used to make music fit dynamic game factors where the team would compose music to underscore outcomes players could make immediately after completing missions.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Each of these stems, Froese reflected, included up to 62 five-minute [[WAV]] files, which were sent to Pavlovich in New York. \"He then created, very professionally, a mix down for each of the eight stems needed for a mission and sent out the material to the other artists involved\", Froese elaborated.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> Oh No drew from scenes within the game to make his work feel contextually pertinent with the action on-screen. The iconographic introduction of Los Santos early in the game, for example, inspired him to \"create a smooth [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] vibe that embodied\" the city.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> He supplied horns, electric and bass guitars, and percussion parts to fit with the car chase scenes. \"We wanted everything to set the right tone\", he explained.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\nThe Rockstar team wanted to synergise the game world's depiction of California with the radio stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate \"Cali feel\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural [[California Sound|saturation of pop music]] necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out&nbsp;...&nbsp;We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' because ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s music plays a pivotal role in generating Californian atmosphere.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Music \"reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he said.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/> Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio, but they refined the number to 241.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two [[Talk radio|talk-back]] stations<ref name=\"GTA V Soundtrack\"/> and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52419/self-radio-create-your-own-custom-radio-station-in-gtav-pc |title=Self Radio: Creating Your Own Custom Radio Station in GTAV PC |author=R* L |work=Rockstar Newswire |publisher=Rockstar Games |date=15 April 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref> Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as [[Rapping|rapper]] and producer [[Flying Lotus]]' original work composed for the FlyLo FM station he hosts.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundtrack\"/> Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station's genre, such as [[Kenny Loggins]] who hosts the [[classic rock]] station Los Santos Rock Radio.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that to strike a balance between the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\n=== Re-release ===\n{{Quote box|quote=There's something incredible about running around this world in first-person, glancing down at Trevor's hands, now your hands and seeing the tattoos, the dirt under his nails ...

The team added new particle and lighting effects, \"like fireflies at night in the countryside, or ambient light pollution over Los Santos at night\", according to Garbut. ''Red Dead Redemption'' inspired the team to add more vegetation to \"break up the hard edges [and] straight lines\" of the open world.<ref name=\"Leaping Gen Gap\"/> The original version's vegetation was replaced with more detailed equivalents in the enhanced version. An upgraded weather system lets tree branches and leaves blow realistically in the wind. The team hand placed weeds along fences and walls, and placed grass over many of the open world's terrains. They then layered flowers, plants, stones, leaves and litter over the grass. An upgraded [[screen space ambient occlusion]] (SSAO) system renders dynamic shadows that may cast through weather effects including volumetric fog, and particle effects including light reflections in water bodies or neon reflections in cars at night. The ambient light pollution over nighttime Los Santos may dissipate in poor weather. A dynamic [[depth of field]] system sharpens and softens images to emulate camera [[autofocus]], and improved [[shader]]s produce new colours in skin and terrain textures.<ref name=\"Leaping Gen Gap\"/>\n\nInitial development of the PC version began in parallel with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but later gave way to focus more on the console releases before returning later to the PC.<ref name=\"PCGamer1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/ |title=Rockstar talk 4K, PC performance and more |last=Roberts |first=Samuel |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=Future plc |date=11 April 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015817/http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PCGamer2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-bug-log-lists-pc-version-and-directx-11-effects/ |title=GTA 5 bug log lists PC version and DirectX 11 effects PC Gamer |last=Dawkins |first=Dan |work=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127030325/http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-bug-log-lists-pc-version-and-directx-11-effects/ |archivedate=27 November 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Because the team had planned a PC version from early on, they made technical decisions in advance to facilitate later development, like support for [[64-bit computing]] and [[DirectX]] 11. The art team authored their source art at high resolutions even though they needed to be compressed on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, with the foresight that PC versions would display these assets uncompressed. These early decisions aided the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions' development as well, due to their similar system architectures to the PC. Their similarities helped the team \"ramp up\" to the PC version, where they could push the visuals and technology further than before.<ref name=\"PCGamer1\"/> The PC development team consisted of members of the original team and PC specialists from Rockstar's other studios who had brought ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', ''Max Payne 3'' and ''L.A. Noire'' to the platform. The PC's recommended specifications are based on the game running a native 1080p resolution at 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (fps); the team suggested 60 fps as the optimal performance benchmark. The PC build supports [[4K resolution]] and uncapped framerates as well. The team opted to give players the choice to configure the game according to their individual system specifications.

hill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rockstar North]]'s former studio in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, where ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''{{'}}s development was overseen|alt=]]\n\nA team of approximately 1,000 people developed ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game, over several years. [[Rockstar Games]] released the game in September 2013 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], in November 2014 for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], and in April 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], as the fifteenth entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. Development began soon after ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''{{'}}s release and was led by [[Rockstar North]]'s core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a [[spiritual successor]] to many of their previous projects like ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and ''[[Max Payne 3]]''. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, [[viral marketing]] strategies and [[special edition]]s. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.\n\nThe game's [[open world]] setting was modelled on [[Los Angeles]] and other areas of [[Southern California]]. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and the proprietary [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE) was overhauled to increase its [[draw distance]] rendering capabilities. Key team members conducted field trips around Southern California to gather research and footage, and [[Google Maps]] projections of Los Angeles were used to help design the city's road networks. For the first time in the series, [[player character|players control]] three protagonists throughout the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode. The team found the multiple protagonist design a fundamental change to the gameplay and narrative devices. They refined the shooting and driving mechanics and tightened the narrative's pacing and scope.\n\nThe actors selected to portray the protagonists invested much time and research into character development. [[Motion capture]] was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game is the first in its series to feature an [[Music of Grand Theft Auto V|original score]], composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added [[First-person (video games)|first-person view]] option along with the traditional [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]]. To accommodate first-person, the game received a major visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== History and overview ===\n[[Image:Grand Theft Auto V development.jpg|thumb|right|The developers overhauled the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] to render [[Particle system|particle effects]] with greater detail than in ''Grand Theft Auto IV''|alt=The player character parachuting in a mountainous valley.

Their work was mostly complete later in development, but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. [[Edgar Froese]], Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria, but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\nJackson's initial role was to provide the score for Trevor's missions, and he took influence from artists such as [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other's work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, however, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. \"Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing\", Jackson said.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Froese had interpolated [[funk]] sounds with Jackson's [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] it. The Alchemist opined, \"We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there&nbsp;...&nbsp;We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> [[DJ Shadow]] then mixed the team's creations and matched it to the gameplay.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich considered \"how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score\" a challenge.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\n[[Image:Flying-Lotus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Flying Lotus]] hosts, and composed original music for, the in-game FlyLo FM radio station|alt=]]\n\nPavlovich found that while Rockstar assigned the team missions to write music for, some of their random creations influenced other missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. He discussed a \"stem-based\" system used to make music fit dynamic game factors where the team would compose music to underscore outcomes players could make immediately after completing missions.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Each of these stems, Froese reflected, included up to 62 five-minute [[WAV]] files, which were sent to Pavlovich in New York. \"He then created, very professionally, a mix down for each of the eight stems needed for a mission and sent out the material to the other artists involved\", Froese elaborated.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> Oh No drew from scenes within the game to make his work feel contextually pertinent with the action on-screen. The iconographic introduction of Los Santos early in the game, for example, inspired him to \"create a smooth [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] vibe that embodied\" the city.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> He supplied horns, electric and bass guitars, and percussion parts to fit with the car chase scenes. \"We wanted everything to set the right tone\", he explained.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\nThe Rockstar team wanted to synergise the game world's depiction of California with the radio stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate \"Cali feel\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural [[California Sound|saturation of pop music]] necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out&nbsp;...&nbsp;We wanted that.

According to Nelson, the first-person view required more development effort than simply repositioning the camera, because of the need to adapt combat to a different view. The weapons were upgraded to a higher resolution, and new animations including weapon recoil, reload and switch were added. \"I think we created 3,000 animations on weapons alone\", said Nelson.<ref name=\"First Person Perspective\"/>\n\nThe PlayStation 4 version uses the [[DualShock 4]]'s touchpad to navigate camera options and speaker to play smartphone calls,<ref name=\"Leaping Gen Gap\"/> while the [[Xbox One Controller]]'s \"Impulse Triggers\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/wireless-controller |title=Xbox One Wireless Controller |work=[[Xbox]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=19 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624131718/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/wireless-controller |archivedate=24 June 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> may rumble while players use vehicles.<ref name=\"IGN PS4/XB1 review in progress\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review |title=GTA 5 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Review in Progress |last=Stapleton |first=Dan |work=IGN |publisher=Ziff Davis |date=17 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119040006/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review |archivedate=19 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The PC version features the \"Rockstar Editor\", a replay editor that lets players create video clips of their gameplay.

The team added new particle and lighting effects, \"like fireflies at night in the countryside, or ambient light pollution over Los Santos at night\", according to Garbut. ''Red Dead Redemption'' inspired the team to add more vegetation to \"break up the hard edges [and] straight lines\" of the open world.<ref name=\"Leaping Gen Gap\"/> The original version's vegetation was replaced with more detailed equivalents in the enhanced version. An upgraded weather system lets tree branches and leaves blow realistically in the wind. The team hand placed weeds along fences and walls, and placed grass over many of the open world's terrains. They then layered flowers, plants, stones, leaves and litter over the grass. An upgraded [[screen space ambient occlusion]] (SSAO) system renders dynamic shadows that may cast through weather effects including volumetric fog, and particle effects including light reflections in water bodies or neon reflections in cars at night. The ambient light pollution over nighttime Los Santos may dissipate in poor weather. A dynamic [[depth of field]] system sharpens and softens images to emulate camera [[autofocus]], and improved [[shader]]s produce new colours in skin and terrain textures.<ref name=\"Leaping Gen Gap\"/>\n\nInitial development of the PC version began in parallel with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but later gave way to focus more on the console releases before returning later to the PC.<ref name=\"PCGamer1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/ |title=Rockstar talk 4K, PC performance and more |last=Roberts |first=Samuel |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=Future plc |date=11 April 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015817/http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PCGamer2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-bug-log-lists-pc-version-and-directx-11-effects/ |title=GTA 5 bug log lists PC version and DirectX 11 effects PC Gamer |last=Dawkins |first=Dan |work=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127030325/http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-bug-log-lists-pc-version-and-directx-11-effects/ |archivedate=27 November 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Because the team had planned a PC version from early on, they made technical decisions in advance to facilitate later development, like support for [[64-bit computing]] and [[DirectX]] 11. The art team authored their source art at high resolutions even though they needed to be compressed on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, with the foresight that PC versions would display these assets uncompressed. These early decisions aided the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions' development as well, due to their similar system architectures to the PC. Their similarities helped the team \"ramp up\" to the PC version, where they could push the visuals and technology further than before.<ref name=\"PCGamer1\"/> The PC development team consisted of members of the original team and PC specialists from Rockstar's other studios who had brought ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', ''Max Payne 3'' and ''L.A. Noire'' to the platform. The PC's recommended specifications are based on the game running a native 1080p resolution at 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (fps); the team suggested 60 fps as the optimal performance benchmark. The PC build supports [[4K resolution]] and uncapped framerates as well. The team opted to give players the choice to configure the game according to their individual system specifications. Players may configure [[Level of detail|LOD]] draw distances, [[anisotropic filtering]], textures, lighting, particle effects, reflections and so on.

Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain, these stable frequencies.

The physical interpretation, for example, is taken by followers of \"frequentist\" statistical methods, such as [[Ronald Fisher]]{{Dubious|date=February 2019}}, [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]]. Statisticians of the opposing [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] school typically accept the existence and importance of physical probabilities, but also consider the calculation of evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics. This article, however, focuses on the interpretations of probability rather than theories of statistical inference.\n\nThe terminology of this topic is rather confusing, in part because probabilities are studied within a variety of academic fields. The word \"frequentist\" is especially tricky. To philosophers it refers to a particular theory of physical probability, one that has more or less been abandoned. To scientists, on the other hand, \"[[frequentist probability]]\" is just another name for physical (or objective) probability. Those who promote Bayesian inference view \"[[frequentist statistics]]\" as an approach to statistical inference that recognises only physical probabilities. Also the word \"objective\", as applied to probability, sometimes means exactly what \"physical\" means here, but is also used of evidential probabilities that are fixed by rational constraints, such as logical and epistemic probabilities.\n\n{{quote|It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel. Doubtless, much of the disagreement is merely terminological and would disappear under sufficiently sharp analysis.|(Savage, 1954, p 2)<ref name=savage />}}\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe '''philosophy of probability''' presents problems chiefly in matters of [[epistemology]] and the uneasy interface between [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.\n[[Probability theory]] is an established field of study in mathematics. It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of [[games of chance]] between [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the seventeenth century,<ref>[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bskyrms/bio/readings/pascal_fermat.pdf Fermat and Pascal on Probability] (@ socsci.uci.edu)</ref> and was formalized and rendered [[axiom]]atic as a distinct branch of mathematics by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in the twentieth century.

This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that \"''it will probably rain''\", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence. Likewise, when it is written that \"the most probable explanation\" of the name of [[Ludlow, Massachusetts]] \"is that it was named after [[Roger Ludlow]]\", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.\n\n[[Thomas Bayes]] attempted to provide a [[logic]] that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, [[Bayesian probability]] is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.\n\nThough probability initially had somewhat mundane motivations, its modern influence and use is widespread ranging from [[evidence-based medicine]], through [[six sigma]], all the way to the [[probabilistically checkable proof]] and the [[string theory landscape]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; \"\n|+ A summary of some interpretations of probability <ref name=\"de El\u00eda\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Classical\n! scope=\"col\" | Frequentist\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective\n! scope=\"col\" | Propensity\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Main hypothesis\n| Principle of indifference || Frequency of occurrence || Degree of belief || Degree of causal connection\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Conceptual basis\n| Hypothetical symmetry || Past data and reference class || Knowledge and intuition || Present state of system\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Conceptual approach\n| Conjectural || Empirical || Subjective || Metaphysical\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Single case possible\n| Yes || No || Yes || Yes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Precise\n| Yes || No || No || Yes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Problems\n| Ambiguity in principle of indifference || Circular definition || Reference class problem || Disputed concept\n|}\n\n==Classical definition==\n{{Main|Classical definition of probability}}\nThe first attempt at mathematical rigour in the field of probability, championed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is now known as the '''classical definition'''. Developed from studies of games of chance (such as rolling [[dice]]) it states that probability is shared equally between all the possible outcomes, provided these outcomes can be deemed equally likely.<ref name=SEPIP /> (3.1)\n\n{{Quotation|The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought.

But some important random experiments, such as tossing a [[coin]] until it rises heads, give rise to an [[Infinity|infinite]] set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity\u2014for instance, by symmetry considerations.\n\n==Frequentism==\n[[Image:Roulette wheel.jpg|left|200px|thumb|For frequentists, the probability of the ball landing in any pocket can be determined only by repeated trials in which the observed result converges to the underlying probability ''in the long run''.]]\n{{Main|Frequency probability}}\nFrequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time,<ref name=SEPIP /> (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as [[aleatory]] probability. The events are assumed to be governed by some [[randomness|random]] physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see [[determinism]]); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing [[dice]] or spinning a [[roulette]] wheel; an example of the second kind is [[radioactive decay]]. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.\n\nIf we denote by <math>\\textstyle n_a</math> the number of occurrences of an event <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> in <math> \\textstyle n</math> trials, then if <math>\\lim_{n \\to +\\infty}{n_a \\over n}=p </math> we say that ''<math>\\textstyle P(\\mathcal{A})=p</math>''.\n\nThe frequentist view has its own problems. It is of course impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only a finite number of repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If we acknowledge the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example \u201c[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf What is the Chance of an Earthquake?]\u201d <ref>Freedman, David and Philip B. Stark (2003)\"What is the Chance of an Earthquake?\" Earthquake Science and Seismic Risk.</ref>\n\n==Subjectivism==\n[[Image:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gambling]] odds reflect the average bettor's 'degree of belief' in the outcome.]]\n{{Main|Bayesian probability}}\nSubjectivists, also known as '''Bayesians''' or followers of '''epistemic probability''', give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it as a measure of the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation. [[Epistemic]] or subjective probability is sometimes called '''[[Credence (statistics)|credence]]''', as opposed to the term '''chance''' for a propensity probability.\n\nSome examples of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true or to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on the evidence presented.\n\nGambling odds don't reflect the bookies' belief in a likely winner, so much as the other bettors' belief, because the bettors are actually betting against one another. The odds are set based on how many people have bet on a possible winner, so that even if the high odds players always win, the bookies will always make their percentages anyway.\n\nThe use of Bayesian probability raises the philosophical debate as to whether it can contribute valid [[theory of justification|justifications]] of [[belief]].\n\nBayesians point to the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]]<ref name=ramsey /> (p 182) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]]<ref name=deF /> (p 103) as proving that subjective beliefs must follow the [[laws of probability]] if they are to be coherent.<ref>{{cite book | last = Jaynes | first = E.

This may be obtained from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} associated with an [[urn model]] or a [[thought experiment]]. The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement: different people may assign different prior probabilities, known as the [[reference class problem]].\nThe \"[[sunrise problem]]\" provides an example.\n\n==Propensity==\n{{Main|Propensity probability}}\n\nPropensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Martin | title = An introduction to decision theory | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2009 | page = 140 | isbn = 978-0521716543 }}</ref> This kind of objective probability is sometimes called 'chance'.\n\nPropensities, or chances, are not relative frequencies, but purported causes of the observed stable relative frequencies. Propensities are invoked to explain why repeating a certain kind of experiment will generate given outcome types at persistent rates, which are known as propensities or chances. Frequentists are unable to take this approach, since relative frequencies do not exist for single tosses of a coin, but only for large ensembles or collectives (see \"single case possible\" in the table above).<ref name=\"de El\u00eda\" /> In contrast, a propensitist is able to use the [[law of large numbers]] to explain the behaviour of long-run frequencies. This law, which is a consequence of the axioms of probability, says that if (for example) a coin is tossed repeatedly many times, in such a way that its probability of landing heads is the same on each toss, and the outcomes are probabilistically independent, then the relative frequency of heads will be close to the probability of heads on each single toss. This law allows that stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of invariant ''single-case'' probabilities. In addition to explaining the emergence of stable relative frequencies, the idea of propensity is motivated by the desire to make sense of single-case probability attributions in quantum mechanics, such as the probability of [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of a particular [[atom]] at a particular time.\n\nThe main challenge facing propensity theories is to say exactly what propensity means. (And then, of course, to show that propensity thus defined has the required properties.) At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.\n\nA propensity theory of probability was given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].<ref name=\"Miller 1975 123\u2013132\">{{Cite journal| last= Miller|first=Richard W.| authorlink6=Richard W.

Peirce, however.<ref name=\"Miller 1975 123\u2013132\"/><ref name=\"Haack 1977 63\u2013104\"/> Popper noted that the outcome of a physical experiment is produced by a certain set of \"generating conditions\". When we repeat an experiment, as the saying goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity ''p'' of producing the outcome ''E'' means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which ''E'' occurred with limiting relative frequency ''p''. For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely nondeterministic experiments.\n\nA number of other philosophers, including [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] and [[Donald A. Gillies]], have proposed propensity theories somewhat similar to Popper's.\n\nOther propensity theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere<ref>{{cite book |author=Ronald N. Giere |title=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |chapter=Objective Single Case Probabilities and the Foundations of Statistics |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0049237X |doi=10.1016/S0049-237X(09)70380-5 |volume=73 |pages=467\u2013483 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-444-10491-5|author-link=Ronald N. Giere }}</ref>) do not explicitly define propensities at all, but rather see propensity as defined by the theoretical role it plays in science. They argued, for example, that physical magnitudes such as [[electrical charge]] cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms of what they do (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges). In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.\n\nWhat roles does physical probability play in science? What are its properties? One central property of chance is that, when known, it constrains rational belief to take the same numerical value. David Lewis called this the ''Principal Principle'',<ref name=SEPIP /> (3.3 & 3.5) a term that philosophers have mostly adopted. For example, suppose you are certain that a particular biased coin has propensity 0.32 to land heads every time it is tossed. What is then the correct price for a gamble that pays $1 if the coin lands heads, and nothing otherwise? According to the Principal Principle, the fair price is 32 cents.\n\n==Logical, epistemic, and inductive probability==\n{{Main|Probabilistic logic}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that the term \"probability\" is sometimes used in contexts where it has nothing to do with physical randomness. Consider, for example, the claim that the extinction of the dinosaurs was '''probably''' caused by a large meteorite hitting the earth. Statements such as \"Hypothesis H is probably true\" have been interpreted to mean that the (presently available) [[empirical evidence]] (E, say) supports H to a high degree. This degree of support of H by E has been called the '''logical''' probability of H given E, or the '''epistemic probability''' of H given E, or the '''inductive probability''' of H given E.\n\nThe differences between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief. Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' [[A Treatise on Probability|Treatise on Probability]]<ref name=keynes />) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief. They are degrees of (partial) [[entailment]], or degrees of [[logical consequence]], not degrees of [[belief]]. (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.) [[Frank P. Ramsey]], on the other hand, was skeptical about the existence of such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is \"the logic of partial belief\".<ref name=ramsey /> (p 157) In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply ''are'' degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely ''constrain'' degrees of rational belief.\n\nAnother point of disagreement concerns the ''uniqueness'' of evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge. [[Rudolf Carnap]] held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence. Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value. Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they all have the same information.\n\n==Prediction==\n{{Main|Predictive inference}}\nAn alternative account of probability emphasizes the role of ''prediction'' \u2013 predicting future observations on the basis of past observations, not on unobservable parameters. In its modern form, it is mainly in the Bayesian vein. This was the main function of probability before the 20th century,<ref name=\"geisser\">{{cite book|last=Geisser|first=Seymour|authorlink=Seymour Geisser|title=Predictive Inference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC|year=1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-412-03471-8}}</ref> but fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system that was observed with error, such as in [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nThe modern predictive approach was pioneered by [[Bruno de Finetti]], with the central idea of [[exchangeability]] \u2013 that future observations should behave like past observations.<ref name=\"geisser\" /> This view came to the attention of the Anglophone world with the 1974 translation of de Finetti's book,<ref name=\"geisser\" /> and has\nsince been propounded by such statisticians as [[Seymour Geisser]].\n\n==Axiomatic probability==\nThe mathematics of probability can be developed on an entirely axiomatic basis that is independent of any interpretation: see the articles on [[probability theory]] and [[probability axioms]] for a detailed treatment.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Frequency (statistics)]]\n* [[Negative probability]]\n* [[Philosophy of statistics]]\n* [[Pignistic probability]]\n* [[Probability amplitude]] (quantum mechanics)\n* [[Sunrise problem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Cohen | first = L |authorlink= Laurence Jonathan Cohen | title = An introduction to the philosophy of induction and probability | url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontoph0000cohe | url-access = registration | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-0198750789 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Eagle | first = Antony|title = Philosophy of probability : contemporary readings | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0415483872 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Gillies | first = Donald |authorlink= Donald A.

The physical interpretation, for example, is taken by followers of \"frequentist\" statistical methods, such as [[Ronald Fisher]]{{Dubious|date=February 2019}}, [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]]. Statisticians of the opposing [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] school typically accept the existence and importance of physical probabilities, but also consider the calculation of evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics. This article, however, focuses on the interpretations of probability rather than theories of statistical inference.\n\nThe terminology of this topic is rather confusing, in part because probabilities are studied within a variety of academic fields. The word \"frequentist\" is especially tricky. To philosophers it refers to a particular theory of physical probability, one that has more or less been abandoned. To scientists, on the other hand, \"[[frequentist probability]]\" is just another name for physical (or objective) probability. Those who promote Bayesian inference view \"[[frequentist statistics]]\" as an approach to statistical inference that recognises only physical probabilities. Also the word \"objective\", as applied to probability, sometimes means exactly what \"physical\" means here, but is also used of evidential probabilities that are fixed by rational constraints, such as logical and epistemic probabilities.\n\n{{quote|It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel. Doubtless, much of the disagreement is merely terminological and would disappear under sufficiently sharp analysis.|(Savage, 1954, p 2)<ref name=savage />}}\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe '''philosophy of probability''' presents problems chiefly in matters of [[epistemology]] and the uneasy interface between [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.\n[[Probability theory]] is an established field of study in mathematics. It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of [[games of chance]] between [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the seventeenth century,<ref>[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bskyrms/bio/readings/pascal_fermat.pdf Fermat and Pascal on Probability] (@ socsci.uci.edu)</ref> and was formalized and rendered [[axiom]]atic as a distinct branch of mathematics by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] in the twentieth century. In axiomatic form, mathematical statements about probability theory carry the same sort of epistemological confidence within the [[philosophy of mathematics]] as are shared by other mathematical statements.<ref>Laszlo E. Szabo, ''[http://philosophy.elte.hu/colloquium/2001/October/Szabo/angol011008/angol011008.html A Physicalist Interpretation of Probability]'' (Talk presented on the Philosophy of Science Seminar, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, Budapest, 8 October 2001.)</ref><ref>Laszlo E.

This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that \"''it will probably rain''\", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence. Likewise, when it is written that \"the most probable explanation\" of the name of [[Ludlow, Massachusetts]] \"is that it was named after [[Roger Ludlow]]\", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.\n\n[[Thomas Bayes]] attempted to provide a [[logic]] that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, [[Bayesian probability]] is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.\n\nThough probability initially had somewhat mundane motivations, its modern influence and use is widespread ranging from [[evidence-based medicine]], through [[six sigma]], all the way to the [[probabilistically checkable proof]] and the [[string theory landscape]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; \"\n|+ A summary of some interpretations of probability <ref name=\"de El\u00eda\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Classical\n! scope=\"col\" | Frequentist\n! scope=\"col\" | Subjective\n! scope=\"col\" | Propensity\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Main hypothesis\n| Principle of indifference || Frequency of occurrence || Degree of belief || Degree of causal connection\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Conceptual basis\n| Hypothetical symmetry || Past data and reference class || Knowledge and intuition || Present state of system\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Conceptual approach\n| Conjectural || Empirical || Subjective || Metaphysical\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Single case possible\n| Yes || No || Yes || Yes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Precise\n| Yes || No || No || Yes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Problems\n| Ambiguity in principle of indifference || Circular definition || Reference class problem || Disputed concept\n|}\n\n==Classical definition==\n{{Main|Classical definition of probability}}\nThe first attempt at mathematical rigour in the field of probability, championed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], is now known as the '''classical definition'''. Developed from studies of games of chance (such as rolling [[dice]]) it states that probability is shared equally between all the possible outcomes, provided these outcomes can be deemed equally likely.<ref name=SEPIP /> (3.1)\n\n{{Quotation|The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought.

But some important random experiments, such as tossing a [[coin]] until it rises heads, give rise to an [[Infinity|infinite]] set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity\u2014for instance, by symmetry considerations.\n\n==Frequentism==\n[[Image:Roulette wheel.jpg|left|200px|thumb|For frequentists, the probability of the ball landing in any pocket can be determined only by repeated trials in which the observed result converges to the underlying probability ''in the long run''.]]\n{{Main|Frequency probability}}\nFrequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time,<ref name=SEPIP /> (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as [[aleatory]] probability. The events are assumed to be governed by some [[randomness|random]] physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see [[determinism]]); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing [[dice]] or spinning a [[roulette]] wheel; an example of the second kind is [[radioactive decay]]. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.\n\nIf we denote by <math>\\textstyle n_a</math> the number of occurrences of an event <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> in <math> \\textstyle n</math> trials, then if <math>\\lim_{n \\to +\\infty}{n_a \\over n}=p </math> we say that ''<math>\\textstyle P(\\mathcal{A})=p</math>''.\n\nThe frequentist view has its own problems. It is of course impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only a finite number of repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If we acknowledge the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example \u201c[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf What is the Chance of an Earthquake?]\u201d <ref>Freedman, David and Philip B. Stark (2003)\"What is the Chance of an Earthquake?\" Earthquake Science and Seismic Risk.</ref>\n\n==Subjectivism==\n[[Image:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gambling]] odds reflect the average bettor's 'degree of belief' in the outcome.]]\n{{Main|Bayesian probability}}\nSubjectivists, also known as '''Bayesians''' or followers of '''epistemic probability''', give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it as a measure of the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation. [[Epistemic]] or subjective probability is sometimes called '''[[Credence (statistics)|credence]]''', as opposed to the term '''chance''' for a propensity probability.\n\nSome examples of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true, and to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on the evidence presented.\n\nGambling odds don't reflect the bookies' belief in a likely winner, so much as the other bettors' belief, because the bettors are actually betting against one another. The odds are set based on how many people have bet on a possible winner, so that even if the high odds players always win, the bookies will always make their percentages anyway.\n\nThe use of Bayesian probability raises the philosophical debate as to whether it can contribute valid [[theory of justification|justifications]] of [[belief]].\n\nBayesians point to the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]]<ref name=ramsey /> (p 182) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]]<ref name=deF /> (p 103) as proving that subjective beliefs must follow the [[laws of probability]] if they are to be coherent.<ref>{{cite book | last = Jaynes | first = E.

This may be obtained from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} associated with an [[urn model]] or a [[thought experiment]]. The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement: different people may assign different prior probabilities, known as the [[reference class problem]].\nThe \"[[sunrise problem]]\" provides an example.\n\n==Propensity==\n{{Main|Propensity probability}}\n\nPropensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Martin | title = An introduction to decision theory | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2009 | page = 140 | isbn = 978-0521716543 }}</ref> This kind of objective probability is sometimes called 'chance'.\n\nPropensities, or chances, are not relative frequencies, but purported causes of the observed stable relative frequencies. Propensities are invoked to explain why repeating a certain kind of experiment will generate given outcome types at persistent rates, which are known as propensities or chances. Frequentists are unable to take this approach, since relative frequencies do not exist for single tosses of a coin, but only for large ensembles or collectives (see \"single case possible\" in the table above).<ref name=\"de El\u00eda\" /> In contrast, a propensitist is able to use the [[law of large numbers]] to explain the behaviour of long-run frequencies. This law, which is a consequence of the axioms of probability, says that if (for example) a coin is tossed repeatedly many times, in such a way that its probability of landing heads is the same on each toss, and the outcomes are probabilistically independent, then the relative frequency of heads will be close to the probability of heads on each single toss. This law allows that stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of invariant ''single-case'' probabilities. In addition to explaining the emergence of stable relative frequencies, the idea of propensity is motivated by the desire to make sense of single-case probability attributions in quantum mechanics, such as the probability of [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of a particular [[atom]] at a particular time.\n\nThe main challenge facing propensity theories is to say exactly what propensity means. (And then, of course, to show that propensity thus defined has the required properties.) At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.\n\nA propensity theory of probability was given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].<ref name=\"Miller 1975 123\u2013132\">{{Cite journal| last= Miller|first=Richard W.| authorlink6=Richard W.

Peirce, however.<ref name=\"Miller 1975 123\u2013132\"/><ref name=\"Haack 1977 63\u2013104\"/> Popper noted that the outcome of a physical experiment is produced by a certain set of \"generating conditions\". When we repeat an experiment, as the saying goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity ''p'' of producing the outcome ''E'' means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which ''E'' occurred with limiting relative frequency ''p''. For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely nondeterministic experiments.\n\nA number of other philosophers, including [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] and [[Donald A. Gillies]], have proposed propensity theories somewhat similar to Popper's.\n\nOther propensity theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere<ref>{{cite book |author=Ronald N. Giere |title=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |chapter=Objective Single Case Probabilities and the Foundations of Statistics |chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0049237X |doi=10.1016/S0049-237X(09)70380-5 |volume=73 |pages=467\u2013483 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-444-10491-5|author-link=Ronald N. Giere }}</ref>) do not explicitly define propensities at all, but rather see propensity as defined by the theoretical role it plays in science. They argued, for example, that physical magnitudes such as [[electrical charge]] cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms of what they do (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges). In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.\n\nWhat roles does physical probability play in science? What are its properties? One central property of chance is that, when known, it constrains rational belief to take the same numerical value. David Lewis called this the ''Principal Principle'',<ref name=SEPIP /> (3.3 & 3.5) a term that philosophers have mostly adopted. For example, suppose you are certain that a particular biased coin has propensity 0.32 to land heads every time it is tossed. What is then the correct price for a gamble that pays $1 if the coin lands heads, and nothing otherwise? According to the Principal Principle, the fair price is 32 cents.\n\n==Logical, epistemic, and inductive probability==\n{{Main|Probabilistic logic}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that the term \"probability\" is sometimes used in contexts where it has nothing to do with physical randomness. Consider, for example, the claim that the extinction of the dinosaurs was '''probably''' caused by a large meteorite hitting the earth. Statements such as \"Hypothesis H is probably true\" have been interpreted to mean that the (presently available) [[empirical evidence]] (E, say) supports H to a high degree. This degree of support of H by E has been called the '''logical''' probability of H given E, or the '''epistemic probability''' of H given E, or the '''inductive probability''' of H given E.\n\nThe differences between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief. Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' [[A Treatise on Probability|Treatise on Probability]]<ref name=keynes />) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief. They are degrees of (partial) [[entailment]], or degrees of [[logical consequence]], not degrees of [[belief]]. (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.) [[Frank P. Ramsey]], on the other hand, was skeptical about the existence of such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is \"the logic of partial belief\".<ref name=ramsey /> (p 157) In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply ''are'' degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely ''constrain'' degrees of rational belief.\n\nAnother point of disagreement concerns the ''uniqueness'' of evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge. [[Rudolf Carnap]] held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence. Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value. Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they all have the same information.\n\n==Prediction==\n{{Main|Predictive inference}}\nAn alternative account of probability emphasizes the role of ''prediction'' \u2013 predicting future observations on the basis of past observations, not on unobservable parameters. In its modern form, it is mainly in the Bayesian vein. This was the main function of probability before the 20th century,<ref name=\"geisser\">{{cite book|last=Geisser|first=Seymour|authorlink=Seymour Geisser|title=Predictive Inference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC|year=1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-412-03471-8}}</ref> but fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system that was observed with error, such as in [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nThe modern predictive approach was pioneered by [[Bruno de Finetti]], with the central idea of [[exchangeability]] \u2013 that future observations should behave like past observations.<ref name=\"geisser\" /> This view came to the attention of the Anglophone world with the 1974 translation of de Finetti's book,<ref name=\"geisser\" /> and has\nsince been propounded by such statisticians as [[Seymour Geisser]].\n\n==Axiomatic probability==\nThe mathematics of probability can be developed on an entirely axiomatic basis that is independent of any interpretation: see the articles on [[probability theory]] and [[probability axioms]] for a detailed treatment.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Frequency (statistics)]]\n* [[Negative probability]]\n* [[Philosophy of statistics]]\n* [[Pignistic probability]]\n* [[Probability amplitude]] (quantum mechanics)\n* [[Sunrise problem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Cohen | first = L |authorlink= Laurence Jonathan Cohen | title = An introduction to the philosophy of induction and probability | url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontoph0000cohe | url-access = registration | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-0198750789 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Eagle | first = Antony|title = Philosophy of probability : contemporary readings | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0415483872 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Gillies | first = Donald |authorlink= Donald A.

One such colleague, [[The O'Rahilly]], ran the league's newspaper ''An Claidheamh Soluis'', and in October 1913 they asked MacNeill to write an editorial for it on a subject more broad than [[Irish language]] issues. MacNeill submitted a piece called \"The North Began\", encouraging formation of a nationalist volunteer force committed to [[Irish Home Rule]], much as the [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] had done earlier that year with the [[Ulster Volunteers]] to thwart Home Rule in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Bulmer Hobson]], a member of the IRB, approached MacNeill about bringing the idea to fruition, and, through a series of meetings, MacNeill became chairman of the council that formed the [[Irish Volunteers]], later becoming its chief of staff. Unlike the IRB, MacNeill was opposed to the idea of an armed rebellion, except in resisting any suppression of the Volunteers, seeing little hope of success in open battle against the [[British army]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Irish Volunteers had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which planned on using the organisation to stage an armed rebellion, with the goal of separating Ireland from the [[United Kingdom]] and establishing an Irish Republic. The entry of the UK into the [[First World War]] was, in their view, a perfect opportunity to do that. With the co-operation of [[James Connolly]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]], a secret council of IRB officials planned a [[Easter Rising|general rising at Easter 1916]]. On the Wednesday before Easter, they presented MacNeill with a letter, allegedly stolen from high-ranking British staff in [[Dublin Castle]], indicating that the British were going to arrest him and all the other nationalist leaders. Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the letter\u2014called the Castle Document\u2014was a forgery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Francis X|title=Leaders and men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916|publisher=Cornell University Press|year= 1967|series=Thomas Davis lectures|pages=120, 147\u2013148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g65nAAAAMAAJ&cd=7&dq=macneil+%22castle+document%22&q=+%22castle+document%22#search_anchor|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned about the IRB's plans, and when he was informed that [[Roger Casement]] was about to land in [[County Kerry]] with a shipment of German arms, he was reluctantly persuaded to go along with them, believing British action was now imminent and that mobilization of the Irish Volunteers would be justified as a defensive act. However, after learning that the German arms shipment had been intercepted and Casement arrested, and having confronted [[Patrick Pearse]], who refused to relent, MacNeill countermanded the order for the Rising by sending written messages to leaders around the country, and placing a notice in the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' cancelling the planned \"manoeuvres\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Townshend |first1=Charles |title=Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion |date=2006 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-141-01216-1 |pages=136\u20137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FNKxBJXMYC&pg=PT156 |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> That greatly reduced the number of volunteers who reported for duty on the day of the Easter Rising.<ref>De Rosa, Peter.

One such colleague, [[The O'Rahilly]], ran the league's newspaper ''An Claidheamh Soluis'', and in October 1913 they asked MacNeill to write an editorial for it on a subject more broad than [[Irish language]] issues. MacNeill submitted a piece called \"The North Began\", encouraging formation of a nationalist volunteer force committed to [[Irish Home Rule]], much as the [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] had done earlier that year with the [[Ulster Volunteers]] to thwart Home Rule in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Bulmer Hobson]], a member of the IRB, approached MacNeill about bringing the idea to fruition, and, through a series of meetings, MacNeill became chairman of the council that formed the [[Irish Volunteers]], later becoming its chief of staff. Unlike the IRB, MacNeill was opposed to the idea of an armed rebellion, except in resisting any suppression of the Volunteers, seeing little hope of success in open battle against the [[British army]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Irish Volunteers had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which planned on using the organisation to stage an armed rebellion, with the goal of separating Ireland from the [[United Kingdom]] and establishing an Irish Republic. The entry of the UK into the [[First World War]] was, in their view, a perfect opportunity to do that. With the co-operation of [[James Connolly]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]], a secret council of IRB officials planned a [[Easter Rising|general rising at Easter 1916]]. On the Wednesday before Easter, they presented MacNeill with a letter, allegedly stolen from high-ranking British staff in [[Dublin Castle]], indicating that the British were going to arrest him and all the other nationalist leaders. Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the letter\u2014called the Castle Document\u2014was a forgery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Francis X|title=Leaders and men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916|publisher=Cornell University Press|year= 1967|series=Thomas Davis lectures|pages=120, 147\u2013148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g65nAAAAMAAJ&cd=7&dq=macneil+%22castle+document%22&q=+%22castle+document%22#search_anchor|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned about the IRB's plans, and when he was informed that [[Roger Casement]] was about to land in [[County Kerry]] with a shipment of German arms, he was reluctantly persuaded to go along with them, believing British action was now imminent and that mobilization of the Irish Volunteers would be justified as a defensive act. However, after learning that the German arms shipment had been intercepted and Casement arrested, and having confronted [[Patrick Pearse]], who refused to relent, MacNeill countermanded the order for the Rising by sending written messages to leaders around the country, and placing a notice in the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' cancelling the planned \"manoeuvres\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Townshend |first1=Charles |title=Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion |date=2006 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-141-01216-1 |pages=136\u20137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FNKxBJXMYC&pg=PT156 |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> That greatly reduced the number of volunteers who reported for duty on the day of the Easter Rising.<ref>De Rosa, Peter.

A [[miner]] and later Member of Parliament in County Durham, he served in the governments of [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Clement Attlee]]. In 1950 he was ennobled as Baron Lawson, of [[Beamish, County Durham|Beamish]] in the [[County Durham|County of Durham]], and is sometimes referred to as '''Lord Lawson of Beamish'''.\n\n==Background==\nLawson was born in the port town of [[Whitehaven]], [[Cumberland]], and grew up in the nearby village of [[Kells, Whitehaven|Kells]]. His father John Lawson was a sailor and miner who had begun working in a colliery by the age of nine, sailed round the world by eleven, and later served in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. His mother, Lisbeth Savage, was a strict disciplinarian. Both parents were illiterate and the family lived in extremes of poverty common at the time. At the age of three, Lawson was sent to the local [[national school (England and Wales)|National School]], Glass House School. Here, he learned to read, developing an avid interest in popular fiction as a boy, and moving on to literary fiction and poetry in later years. When he was six his family moved to the village of [[Flimby]], near the towns of [[Maryport]] and [[Workington]]. The family now included ten children: five boys and five girls. Two of his elder brothers worked with his father at the local colliery and the family was no longer on the breadline. A year later, they moved to [[County Durham]], where the working members were employed at [[Boldon Colliery]].  The family joined the [[Co-operative]] Society, and were committed trade unionists, active in the Durham miners' strike of 1892. Outside of school, Jack Lawson's time was consumed with chores and he often looked after his youngest brother, Will, born in 1890.\n\nLawson eagerly began work in the colliery the day after he turned twelve. He started as a trapper, opening and shutting doors for the drivers, working a ten-hour day. He was paid ten pence per day, and his life greatly improved \u2013 he was treated as an adult now. After a few months he became a driver, with his own pony. After a couple more years, he began off-hand work, braking inclines and attending to the signalling bells. He began attending union meetings, including the annual [[Durham Miners' Gala]], where in later years he met the likes of [[Will Crooks]], [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[George Lansbury]]. At eighteen he became a putter and began speaking and working for the union. With five members of the family now working at the colliery, the Lawsons had a higher status and moved into a house closer to the pit, with a front room. Throughout this period he gambled frequently and read a lot: Eventually, reading won over gambling. He had read nothing of economics or politics yet, but had developed a strong sense of injustice, firmly believing that manual workers were under-paid and under-valued. These ideas generally seemed strange to his colleagues and family and he kept them to himself. He joined the [[Methodist]] Society, and found his ideas more accepted there. Through reading the ''[[Labour Leader]]'' and ''[[The Clarion]]'', Lawson realised he was a socialist. At the age of 21 he met Isabella Graham Scott, a domestic servant from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] who was staying with friends at Boldon.<ref name=\"bella\">{{cite web |title=What Wonderful Women: Ladies with Honours |url=http://www.durhamintime.org.uk/www/pdfs/public%20service%20and%20honours%203.pdf |website=Durham in Time |publisher=[[Durham County Council]] |accessdate=20 May 2019 |pages=3\u20135}}</ref> They were married in February 1906.<ref name=DNB>{{cite ODNB|title=Lawson, John James , Baron Lawson (1881\u20131965) |id=47371 }}</ref>\n\n==Trade Unionist==\nIn 1904, Lawson joined the newly founded branch of the [[Independent Labour Party]] at Boldon. He was invited to be a speaker, but initially refused, unsure of his own ability. He discovered a socialist bookshop in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where he met many like-minded people, and read books on economics and society, including those of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[John Ruskin]]. He became a hewer that year, working at the coal-face, and within a few months was elected as an assistant [[checkweighman]]. He had no ambition for work beyond being a hewer, but he did want to continue his education. He began teaching boys who worked at the colliery and then helped to set up a school for adults in two disused colliery houses.\n\nIn 1905 Lawson became an active speaker for the ILP, expounding socialism and the [[Labour Party (UK)#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]] to the miners of Durham, who had traditionally supported the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Later that year, Lawson joined a correspondence class with [[Ruskin College, Oxford]]. The following spring, Lawson received a letter from the college offering him six months' scholarship if he could find the money to pay for the other six months. This was a significant expense that would be compounded by living costs, and as Lawson was determined that he would only ever work as a miner there was no obvious advantage to university study. Canon [[William Moore Ede]], a county councillor and later [[dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], convinced him to go and helped raise some of the fees; Lawson and his wife sold their furniture and saved what they could, and the rest was paid by his parents. His wife moved to [[Oxford]] with him, finding work and accommodation as a servant in a series of homes. Amongst his tutors, [[Hastings Lees-Smith]], the vice-principal of Ruskin and a lecturer on economics, had a particular influence on Lawson.\n\nAt the end of the year, Lawson was offered a further six months scholarship on the same terms, and after working at Boldon over the winter to raise the money he began his second year of study in February 1908. Halfway through that year, he was told that the College Council had decided to extend his scholarship to cover the rest of the full year. It was suggested he should enter [[Manchester College, Oxford]], to study for a degree. He was grateful but refused, not wanting a professional career; three months later, he returned to Boldon. He became well known around the county, as a speaker for both the ILP and the union. He was a negotiator for his union lodge and a delegate to the Miner's Council at Durham.\n\nIn 1909, he was invited by the union to run for Durham [[County Council]], but he was not yet on the electoral register and was ineligible to stand. [[Peter Francis Curran|Pete Curran]], Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Jarrow (UK Parliament constituency)|Jarrow]], had made Lawson his election agent: this was unpaid, hard work, and consumed all of Lawson's spare time during campaigns, as he travelled to and around Jarrow division. Curran was hit by ill health in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]] and had trouble campaigning. He lost by less than 100 votes and died within a week. The Lawson's first daughter, Irene, was born later that year. Whilst campaigning in the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election in December]], Lawson was asked by friends in [[Chester-le-Street]] to stand for the position of checkweighman at Alma Colliery. Elected and paid by hewers, as a checkweighman he would be responsible for ensuring miners received the full amount due for the coal they dug and would act as their legal representative.  Lawson was reluctant to leave manual work, but allowed his name to go forward.  Labour lost Jarrow again; at the same time, the miners at Alma, elected him almost unanimously.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nTwo years after moving there, Lawson was elected to the County Council for the Chester-le-Street division. He wrote a pamphlet campaigning for minimum wage for miners and was a leading figure in Durham during the miners' strike of 1912 on this issue.  He and his wife had a second daughter, Edna, while his brother Will, whom he had tutored, took a diploma in Economics and Political Science at Ruskin.  In 1913 he was a delegate to the Miner's International in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]]. Journeying through [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], he saw the growing Prussian army, and once in the Balkans witnessed some of the troubles that would spark the [[world War I|first World War]].  When war broke out in 1914, Will Lawson became an officer in the [[Durham Light Infantry]].  Jack Lawson followed his example, volunteering for service; experienced with horses, he was assigned as a driver with the [[Royal Field Artillery]], serving in France. Another brother, Tom, joined the [[Border Regiment]].  Will Lawson was sent to Ypres in January 1915, and died in battle thirteen months later.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Jack Lawson was granted temporary leave to contest the [[Seaham (UK Parliament constituency)|Seaham division of Durham]] in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]; he campaigned against [[war reparations]] and won only a third of the votes against a coalition candidate.  After that he was sent to [[Clipstone]] in Derbyshire, where he was demobbed.  Returning to work at Alma Colliery and as a county councillor, he started to have health problems and was sick during the council elections the following year.  The Labour Party, which entered the election with around a dozen out of one hundred councillors, won control of the council.\n\nLater in 1919, [[John Wilkinson Taylor (politician)|John Taylor]], Labour MP for [[Chester-le-Street (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester-le-Street]] since [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] and a friend of Lawson's, resigned his seat due to ill health.  Though reluctant to risk leaving Durham and the colliery for London and Parliament, Lawson was persuaded to stand for Labour in the by-election.  He was sponsored by the Durham Miner's Association and won with a majority of eleven thousand, entering the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in November 1919.\n\n[[Ramsay MacDonald]] appointed Lawson as [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]] in the [[Labour Government 1924|1924 Labour government]].  He worked alongside [[Clement Attlee]], and the two came to enjoy a very firm friendship and mutual admiration.  Both felt odd, controlling generals they'd served under a few years before, but the generals liked them, considering them less idle than their predecessors.  He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]] in the [[Labour Government 1929\u20131931|1929 Labour government]], but refused MacDonald's invitation to join the [[Second National Government 1931\u20131935|National Government]] following the split in 1931.\n\nThe [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] was disastrous for Labour, and Lawson was one of only two Durham Labour MPs to keep their seats, out of seventeen who won there in the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 election]].  During the 1930s, Lawson supplemented his income as an MP by writing.  He published his autobiography, ''A Man's Life'', in 1932, intended as a record of the family life of miners.  He followed this with a novel about miners, ''Under the Wheels'', and biographies of [[Peter Lee (trade unionist)|Peter Lee]] and [[Herbert Smith (trade unionist)|Herbert Smith]].  He also wrote for newspapers and periodicals.\n\n==Elder Statesman==\nWhen Attlee became leader of the Labour Party in 1935, he created a new Defence Committee for the party, appointing Lawson along with [[A. V. Alexander]] and [[Manny Shinwell]].  In April 1936, Lawson wrote a column in the ''[[Sunday Sun]]'' criticising the National Government's policy of [[appeasement]]: Entitled \"Watch Winston\", it predicted the government's policy of appeasement would result in war, and that [[Winston Churchill]], at that time a marginal figure, would return to become Prime Minister.  In April 1939, during the build-up to the [[Second World War]], Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], the Home Secretary, appointed Lawson as Deputy Commissioner for Civil Defence in the Northern Region. This region covered Durham, [[Northumberland]] and the [[North Riding of Yorkshire|North Riding]]; Lawson oversaw preparations for aerial bombardment and possible invasion, and the organisation of shelter and relief when bombing began.  Lawson later refused the offer of a position in government to continue his work in civil defence.  His third daughter, Alma, was a gunner in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]]; his son Clive, born in 1932, was killed by a bomb in 1941.\n\nWith Labour's victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election of July 1945]], Lawson was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], with a seat in Attlee's Cabinet. During the closing months of the war, he travelled thousands of miles, visiting troops in India and the Far East, and speaking at military functions and mass meetings.  His refusal to stick to the scheduled, whitewashed routes on official visits, insistence on seeing everything for himself, and willingness to stop and listen to everyone he met, made him unpopular with senior officers.  However, he was very popular with soldiers, who were glad that one of their own was now in the War Office.  Lawson oversaw planning for post-war operations, including the occupation of Germany, and for the mass demobilisation, ensuring it happened quickly and smoothly.  He also served as one of Attlee's key allies in the Cabinet, particularly during early conflicts with [[Herbert Morrison]].  However, from the summer of 1946, Lawson found his job increasingly difficult: he suffered severe health problems and had to go into hospital, retiring from the front bench in October.\n\nIn 1949, on Attlee's recommendation, the King appointed Jack Lawson as [[Lord Lieutenant of Durham]]. He resigned from parliament in December 1949 on appointment as vice-chairman of the [[Countryside Commission|National Parks Commission]], he was made a hereditary peer as '''Baron Lawson''', of [[Beamish, County Durham|Beamish]] in the County of Durham, in March 1950.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38868 |date=21 March 1950 |page=1423 }}The extract from ''The London Gazette'', TUESDAY, 21 MARCH, 1950:\n</ref>{{quote|Whitehall, March 21, 1950.\nThe KING has been pleased, by Letters Patent<br/>\nunder the Great Seal of the Realm, bearing date the<br/>\n17th instant, to confer the dignity of a Barony of<br/>\nthe United Kingdom upon The Right Honourable<br/>\nJohn James Lawson, and the heirs male of his body<br/>\nlawfully begotten, by the name, style and title of<br/>\nBARON LAWSON, of Beamish in the County of Durham.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"The London Gazette\" |url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38868/page/1423 |accessdate=January 12, 2018 }}</ref><br/><br/>The extract from ''The London Gazette'', TUESDAY, 21 MARCH, 1950.}}<br/> Lords Lieutenant are unpaid, and Lawson, one of the first working-class men to hold such a position, received [[Welfare (financial aid)|income support]].

His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Sam Watson (trade unionist)|Sam Watson]], became General Secretary of the Durham Miners and one of the most influential trade unionists in the party.\n\n[[File:Grave and Headstone of Lord Lawson of Beamish - geograph.org.uk - 503327.jpg|thumb|Lawson's grave in St Paul's Churchyard, [[West Pelton]]]]\nLawson retired as Lord Lieutenant in 1958 and died in 1965, at the age of83.

Outside of school, Jack Lawson's time was consumed with chores and he often looked after his youngest brother, Will, born in 1890.\n\nLawson eagerly began work in the colliery the day after he turned twelve. He started as a trapper, opening and shutting doors for the drivers, working a ten-hour day. He was paid ten pence per day, and his life greatly improved \u2013 he was treated as an adult now. After a few months he became a driver, with his own pony. After a couple more years, he began off-hand work, braking inclines and attending to the signalling bells. He began attending union meetings, including the annual [[Durham Miners' Gala]], where in later years he met the likes of [[Will Crooks]], [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[George Lansbury]]. At eighteen he became a putter and began speaking and working for the union. With five members of the family now working at the colliery, the Lawsons had a higher status and moved into a house closer to the pit, with a front room. Throughout this period he gambled frequently and read a lot: Eventually, reading won over gambling. He had read nothing of economics or politics yet, but had developed a strong sense of injustice, firmly believing that manual workers were under-paid and under-valued. These ideas generally seemed strange to his colleagues and family and he kept them to himself. He joined the [[Methodist]] Society, and found his ideas more accepted there. Through reading the ''[[Labour Leader]]'' and ''[[The Clarion]]'', Lawson realised he was a socialist. At the age of 21 he met Isabella Graham Scott, a domestic servant from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] who was staying with friends at Boldon.<ref name=\"bella\">{{cite web |title=What Wonderful Women: Ladies with Honours |url=http://www.durhamintime.org.uk/www/pdfs/public%20service%20and%20honours%203.pdf |website=Durham in Time |publisher=[[Durham County Council]] |accessdate=20 May 2019 |pages=3\u20135}}</ref> They were married in February 1906.<ref name=DNB>{{cite ODNB|title=Lawson, John James , Baron Lawson (1881\u20131965) |id=47371 }}</ref>\n\n==Trade Unionist==\nIn 1904, Lawson joined the newly founded branch of the [[Independent Labour Party]] at Boldon. He was invited to be a speaker, but initially refused, unsure of his own ability. He discovered a socialist bookshop in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where he met many like-minded people, and read books on economics and society, including those of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[John Ruskin]]. He became a hewer that year, working at the coal-face, and within a few months was elected as an assistant [[checkweighman]]. He had no ambition for work beyond being a hewer, but he did want to continue his education. He began teaching boys who worked at the colliery and then helped to set up a school for adults in two disused colliery houses.\n\nIn 1905 Lawson became an active speaker for the ILP, expounding socialism and the [[Labour Party (UK)#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]] to the miners of Durham, who had traditionally supported the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Later that year, Lawson joined a correspondence class with [[Ruskin College, Oxford]]. The following spring, Lawson received a letter from the college offering him six months' scholarship if he could find the money to pay for the other six months. This was a significant expense that would be compounded by living costs, and as Lawson was determined that he would only ever work as a miner there was no obvious advantage to university study. Canon [[William Moore Ede]], a county councillor and later [[dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], convinced him to go and helped raise some of the fees; Lawson and his wife sold their furniture and saved what they could, and the rest was paid by his parents. His wife moved to [[Oxford]] with him, finding work and accommodation as a servant in a series of homes. Amongst his tutors, [[Hastings Lees-Smith]], the vice-principal of Ruskin and a lecturer on economics, had a particular influence on Lawson.\n\nAt the end of the year, Lawson was offered a further six months scholarship on the same terms, and after working at Boldon over the winter to raise the money he began his second year of study in February 1908. Halfway through that year, he was told that the College Council had decided to extend his scholarship to cover the rest of the full year. It was suggested he should enter [[Manchester College, Oxford]], to study for a degree. He was grateful but refused, not wanting a professional career; three months later, he returned to Boldon. He became well-known around the county, as a speaker for both the ILP and the union. He was a negotiator for his union lodge and a delegate to the Miner's Council at Durham.\n\nIn 1909, he was invited by the union to run for Durham [[County Council]], but he was not yet on the electoral register and was ineligible to stand. [[Peter Francis Curran|Pete Curran]], Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Jarrow (UK Parliament constituency)|Jarrow]], had made Lawson his election agent: this was unpaid, hard work, and consumed all of Lawson's spare time during campaigns, as he travelled to and around Jarrow division. Curran was hit by ill health in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]] and had trouble campaigning. He lost by less than 100 votes and died within a week. The Lawson's first daughter, Irene, was born later that year. Whilst campaigning in the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|general election in December]], Lawson was asked by friends in [[Chester-le-Street]] to stand for the position of checkweighman at Alma Colliery. Elected and paid by hewers, as a checkweighman he would be responsible for ensuring miners received the full amount due for the coal they dug and would act as their legal representative.  Lawson was reluctant to leave manual work, but allowed his name to go forward.  Labour lost Jarrow again; at the same time, the miners at Alma, elected him almost unanimously.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nTwo years after moving there, Lawson was elected to the County Council for the Chester-le-Street division. He wrote a pamphlet campaigning for minimum wage for miners and was a leading figure in Durham during the miners' strike of 1912 on this issue.  He and his wife had a second daughter, Edna, while his brother Will, whom he had tutored, took a diploma in Economics and Political Science at Ruskin.  In 1913 he was a delegate to the Miner's International in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]]. Journeying through [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], he saw the growing Prussian army, and once in the Balkans witnessed some of the troubles that would spark the [[world War I|first World War]].  When war broke out in 1914, Will Lawson became an officer in the [[Durham Light Infantry]].  Jack Lawson followed his example, volunteering for service; experienced with horses, he was assigned as a driver with the [[Royal Field Artillery]], serving in France. Another brother, Tom, joined the [[Border Regiment]].  Will Lawson was sent to Ypres in January 1915, and died in battle thirteen months later.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Jack Lawson was granted temporary leave to contest the [[Seaham (UK Parliament constituency)|Seaham division of Durham]] in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]; he campaigned against [[war reparations]] and won only a third of the votes against a coalition candidate.  After that he was sent to [[Clipstone]] in Derbyshire, where he was demobbed.  Returning to work at Alma Colliery and as a county councillor, he started to have health problems and was sick during the council elections the following year.  The Labour Party, which entered the election with around a dozen out of one hundred councillors, won control of the council.\n\nLater in 1919, [[John Wilkinson Taylor (politician)|John Taylor]], Labour MP for [[Chester-le-Street (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester-le-Street]] since [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]] and a friend of Lawson's, resigned his seat due to ill health.  Though reluctant to risk leaving Durham and the colliery for London and Parliament, Lawson was persuaded to stand for Labour in the by-election.  He was sponsored by the Durham Miner's Association and won with a majority of eleven thousand, entering the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in November 1919.\n\n[[Ramsay MacDonald]] appointed Lawson as [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]] in the [[Labour Government 1924|1924 Labour government]].  He worked alongside [[Clement Attlee]], and the two came to enjoy a very firm friendship and mutual admiration.  Both felt odd, controlling generals they'd served under a few years before, but the generals liked them, considering them less idle than their predecessors.  He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]] in the [[Labour Government 1929\u20131931|1929 Labour government]], but refused MacDonald's invitation to join the [[Second National Government 1931\u20131935|National Government]] following the split in 1931.\n\nThe [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] was disastrous for Labour, and Lawson was one of only two Durham Labour MPs to keep their seats, out of seventeen who won there in the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 election]].  During the 1930s, Lawson supplemented his income as an MP by writing.  He published his autobiography, ''A Man's Life'', in 1932, intended as a record of the family life of miners.  He followed this with a novel about miners, ''Under the Wheels'', and biographies of [[Peter Lee (trade unionist)|Peter Lee]] and [[Herbert Smith (trade unionist)|Herbert Smith]].  He also wrote for newspapers and periodicals.\n\n==Elder Statesman==\nWhen Attlee became leader of the Labour Party in 1935, he created a new Defence Committee for the party, appointing Lawson along with [[A. V. Alexander]] and [[Manny Shinwell]].  In April 1936, Lawson wrote a column in the ''[[Sunday Sun]]'' criticising the National Government's policy of [[appeasement]]: Entitled \"Watch Winston\", it predicted the government's policy of appeasement would result in war, and that [[Winston Churchill]], at that time a marginal figure, would return to become Prime Minister.  In April 1939, during the build-up to the [[Second World War]], Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], the Home Secretary, appointed Lawson as Deputy Commissioner for Civil Defence in the Northern Region. This region covered Durham, [[Northumberland]] and the [[North Riding of Yorkshire|North Riding]]; Lawson oversaw preparations for aerial bombardment and possible invasion, and the organisation of shelter and relief when bombing began.  Lawson later refused the offer of a position in government to continue his work in civil defence.  His third daughter, Alma, was a gunner in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]]; his son Clive, born in 1932, was killed by a bomb in 1941.\n\nWith Labour's victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election of July 1945]], Lawson was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], with a seat in Attlee's Cabinet. During the closing months of the war, he travelled thousands of miles, visiting troops in India and the Far East, and speaking at military functions and mass meetings.  His refusal to stick to the scheduled, whitewashed routes on official visits, insistence on seeing everything for himself, and willingness to stop and listen to everyone he met, made him unpopular with senior officers.  However, he was very popular with soldiers, who were glad that one of their own was now in the War Office.  Lawson oversaw planning for post-war operations, including the occupation of Germany, and for the mass demobilisation, ensuring it happened quickly and smoothly.  He also served as one of Attlee's key allies in the Cabinet, particularly during early conflicts with [[Herbert Morrison]].  However, from the summer of 1946, Lawson found his job increasingly difficult: he suffered severe health problems and had to go into hospital, retiring from the front bench in October.\n\nIn 1949, on Attlee's recommendation, the King appointed Jack Lawson as [[Lord Lieutenant of Durham]]. He resigned from parliament in December 1949 on appointment as vice-chairman of the [[Countryside Commission|National Parks Commission]], he was made a hereditary peer as '''Baron Lawson''', of [[Beamish, County Durham|Beamish]] in the County of Durham, in March 1950.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38868 |date=21 March 1950 |page=1423 }}The extract from ''The London Gazette'', TUESDAY, 21 MARCH, 1950:\n</ref>{{quote|Whitehall, March 21, 1950.\nThe KING has been pleased, by Letters Patent<br/>\nunder the Great Seal of the Realm, bearing date the<br/>\n17th instant, to confer the dignity of a Barony of<br/>\nthe United Kingdom upon The Right Honourable<br/>\nJohn James Lawson, and the heirs male of his body<br/>\nlawfully begotten, by the name, style and title of<br/>\nBARON LAWSON, of Beamish in the County of Durham.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"The London Gazette\" |url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38868/page/1423 |accessdate=January 12, 2018 }}</ref><br/><br/>The extract from ''The London Gazette'', TUESDAY, 21 MARCH, 1950.}}<br/> Lords Lieutenant are unpaid, and Lawson, one of the first working-class men to hold such a position, received [[Welfare (financial aid)|income support]].

Still a close friend of Attlee, he provided moral support during struggle to hold the Labour Party together during the 1950s. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Sam Watson (trade unionist)|Sam Watson]], became General Secretary of the Durham Miners and one of the most influential trade unionists in the party.\n\n[[File:Grave and Headstone of Lord Lawson of Beamish - geograph.org.uk - 503327.jpg|thumb|Lawson's grave in St Paul's Churchyard, [[West Pelton]]]]\nLawson retired as Lord Lieutenant in 1958 and died in 1965, at the age of83.
