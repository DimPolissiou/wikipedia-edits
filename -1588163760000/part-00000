2010)\n* Red Soda (strawberry) - This flavour is now listed on the packaging. Before, it was just called red soda or nam dang (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07 - literally means red water). Red Fanta was reportedly the preferred drink of the then-King of Thailand [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water).

Red Fanta was reportedly the preferred drink of the then-King of Thailand [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water).

The nature of the fire depends somewhat on local [[topography]]. Hilly/mountainous fires burn in areas which are usually densely forested. The land is less accessible and not conducive to agriculture, thus many of these densely forested areas have been saved from [[deforestation]] and are protected by national, state and other parks. The steep terrain increases the speed and intensity of a firestorm. Where settlements are located in hilly or mountainous areas, bushfires can pose a threat to both life and property. Flat/grassland fires burn along flat plains or areas of small undulation, predominantly covered in grasses or scrubland. These fires can move quickly, fanned by high winds in flat topography, and they quickly consume the small amounts of fuel/vegetation available. These fires pose less of a threat to settlements as they rarely reach the same intensity seen in major firestorms as the land is flat, the fires are easier to map and predict, and the terrain is more accessible for [[firefighting]] personnel. Many regions of predominantly flat terrain in Australia have been almost completely deforested for agriculture, reducing the fuel loads which would otherwise facilitate fires in these areas.\n\n=== Climate change ===\n{{See also| Climate change in Australia}}\nAustralia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts.<ref name=\"ScientificAmerican\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/australias-angry-summer-this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like/|title=Australia's Angry Summer: This Is What Climate Change Looks Like|author=Abram, Nerilie|author-link=Nerilie Abram|date=31 December 2019|work=Scientific American|accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref> Eight of Australia's ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005.<ref name=stuff>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/118568474/australia-bushfires-spew-twothirds-of-national-carbon-emissions-in-one-season|title=Australia bushfires spew two-thirds of national carbon emissions in one season|work=Stuff|location=New Zealand|date=3 January 2019|accessdate=}}</ref> A study in 2018 conducted at Melbourne University found that the major droughts of the late 20th century and early 21st century in southern Australia are \"likely without precedent over the past 400 years\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=Freund, Mandy|author2=Henley, Ben|author3=Allen, Kathryn|author4=Baker, Patrick|url=https://theconversation.com/recent-australian-droughts-may-be-the-worst-in-800-years-94292|title=Recent Australian droughts may be the worst in 800 years|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|author= |date=2 May 2018|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> Across the country, the average summer temperatures have increased leading to record-breaking hot weather,<ref name=\"auto\"/> with the early summer of 2019 the hottest on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/Climate%20of%20the%20Nation%202019%20%5BWEB%5D.pdf|title=Climate of the Nation|year=2019|publisher=The Australia Institute|page=3|issn=|accessdate=}}</ref> 2019 was also Australia's driest ever year since 1900 with rainfall 40% lower than average.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite news|author=Readfearn, Graham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/explainer-what-are-the-underlying-causes-of-australias-shocking-bushfire-season|title=Explainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?|work=Guardian Australia|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHeatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create conditions that increase the risk of bushfires.

Professor Chris Dickman at Sydney University estimates that in the first three months of the [[2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season|2019\u20132020 bushfires]], over 800&nbsp;million animals died in NSW, and more than one billion nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/08/australian-bushfires-more-than-one-billion-animals-impacted.html|title=More than one billion animals killed in Australian bushfires|publisher=University of Sydney|date=8 January 2020|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref> This figure includes mammals, birds, and reptiles but does not include insects, bats or frogs. Many of these animals were burnt to death in the fires, with many others dying later due to the depletion of food and shelter resources and predation by feral cats and red foxes.

In extreme fires, koalas tend to climb up to the top of a tree and curl into a ball where they become trapped. In January 2020 it was reported that half of the 50,000 koalas on [[Kangaroo Island]] off Australia's southern coast, which are kept separate to those on the mainland as insurance for the species\u2019 future, are thought to have died in the previous few weeks.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/kangaroo-koala-australia-bushfires-wildfires-die|title=The world loves kangaroos and koalas.

Loss of habitat also affects already endangered species such as the western ground parrot, the Leadbeater's possum, the Mallee emu-wren (a bird which cannot fly very far), and Gilbert's potoroo. Beekeepers have also lost hives in bushfires.<ref name=\"BBC_22Nov2019\"/>\n\nKangaroos and wallabies can move quickly trying to escape from fires. However, the Guardian reported in January 2020 that dozens, maybe hundreds of kangaroos \"perished in their droves\" as they tried to outrun the flames near Batlow in NSW.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The most resilient animals are those that can burrow or fly. Possums often get singed, but can sometimes hide in tree hollows. Wombats and snakes tend to go underground.<ref name=BBC_22Nov2019/>\n\n[[Goanna]]s can benefit from bushfires. Dickman says: \"In central Australia, we've seen goannas coming out from their burrows after a fire and picking off injured animals \u2013 singed birds, young birds, small mammals, surface-dwelling lizards, and snakes.\"<ref name=BBC_22Nov2019/>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nIn South Australia, Kangaroo Island was devastated when 25,000 Koalas were killed. The island is renowned for its mixture of animal species, and fear that it may never recover its population. Tens of thousands of farm animals, mostly sheep, were also killed in the fire on Kangaroo Island. There are concerns about the survival of endangered species on Kangaroo Island, which include the dunnart (a mouse-like marsupial) and the black glossy cockatoo.\n\n== Impact on humans ==\n\nThe most devastating impact on humans is that bushfires have killed over 800 people since 1851.<ref name=Tronson/> In addition to loss of life, homes, properties, and livestock are destroyed potentially leaving people homeless, traumatised, and without access to electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, to drinking water.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-bushfires-insurance/australia-strengthens-bushfire-defenses-as-economic-environmental-costs-mount-idUSKBN1Z601F Australia strengthens bushfire defenses as economic, environmental costs mount], Reuters, 7 January 2020</ref>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nAt least 33 people have been killed, 4 of which were firefighters.

More than 80 homes were destroyed in South Australia near Adelaide Hills, as well as one-third of the vineyards that provide grapes for the wine industry.\n\n=== Health ===\nBushfires produce particulate-matter pollution \u2013 airborne particles that are small enough to enter and damage human lung tissue. Following the [[Hazelwood Power Station#Coal mine fire|Hazelwood fire]] in 2014, Fay Johnston, an associate professor of public health at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research, says young children exposed to smoke either as infants, toddlers or in the womb develop changes to their lung function.

They spread based on the type and quantity of fuel that is available. Fuel can include everything from trees, underbrush and dry grassy fields to homes. Wind supplies the fire with additional oxygen pushing the fire across the land at a faster rate.

The nature of the fire depends somewhat on local [[topography]]. Hilly/mountainous fires burn in areas which are usually densely forested. The land is less accessible and not conducive to agriculture, thus many of these densely forested areas have been saved from [[deforestation]] and are protected by national, state and other parks. The steep terrain increases the speed and intensity of a firestorm. Where settlements are located in hilly or mountainous areas, bushfires can pose a threat to both life and property. Flat/grassland fires burn along flat plains or areas of small undulation, predominantly covered in grasses or scrubland. These fires can move quickly, fanned by high winds in flat topography, and they quickly consume the small amounts of fuel/vegetation available. These fires pose less of a threat to settlements as they rarely reach the same intensity seen in major firestorms as the land is flat, the fires are easier to map and predict, and the terrain is more accessible for [[firefighting]] personnel. Many regions of predominantly flat terrain in Australia have been almost completely deforested for agriculture, reducing the fuel loads which would otherwise facilitate fires in these areas.\n\n=== Climate change ===\n{{See also| Climate change in Australia}}\nAustralia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts.<ref name=\"ScientificAmerican\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/australias-angry-summer-this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like/|title=Australia's Angry Summer: This Is What Climate Change Looks Like|author=Abram, Nerilie|author-link=Nerilie Abram|date=31 December 2019|work=Scientific American|accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref> Eight of Australia's ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005.<ref name=stuff>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/118568474/australia-bushfires-spew-twothirds-of-national-carbon-emissions-in-one-season|title=Australia bushfires spew two-thirds of national carbon emissions in one season|work=Stuff|location=New Zealand|date=3 January 2019|accessdate=}}</ref> A study in 2018 conducted at Melbourne University found that the major droughts of the late 20th century and early 21st century in southern Australia are \"likely without precedent over the past 400 years\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=Freund, Mandy|author2=Henley, Ben|author3=Allen, Kathryn|author4=Baker, Patrick|url=https://theconversation.com/recent-australian-droughts-may-be-the-worst-in-800-years-94292|title=Recent Australian droughts may be the worst in 800 years|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|author= |date=2 May 2018|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> Across the country, the average summer temperatures have increased leading to record-breaking hot weather,<ref name=\"auto\"/> with the early summer of 2019 the hottest on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/Climate%20of%20the%20Nation%202019%20%5BWEB%5D.pdf|title=Climate of the Nation|year=2019|publisher=The Australia Institute|page=3|issn=|accessdate=}}</ref> 2019 was also Australia's driest ever year since 1900 with rainfall 40% lower than average.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite news|author=Readfearn, Graham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/explainer-what-are-the-underlying-causes-of-australias-shocking-bushfire-season|title=Explainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?|work=Guardian Australia|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHeatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create conditions that increase the risk of bushfires.

Professor Chris Dickman at Sydney University estimates that in the first three months of the [[2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season|2019\u20132020 bushfires]], over 800&nbsp;million animals died in NSW, and more than one billion nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/08/australian-bushfires-more-than-one-billion-animals-impacted.html|title=More than one billion animals killed in Australian bushfires|publisher=University of Sydney|date=8 January 2020|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref> This figure includes mammals, birds, and reptiles but does not include insects, bats or frogs. Many of these animals were burnt to death in the fires, with many others dying later due to the depletion of food and shelter resources and predation by feral cats and red foxes.

In extreme fires, koalas tend to climb up to the top of a tree and curl into a ball where they become trapped. In January 2020 it was reported that half of the 50,000 koalas on [[Kangaroo Island]] off Australia's southern coast, which are kept separate to those on the mainland as insurance for the species\u2019 future, are thought to have died in the previous few weeks.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/kangaroo-koala-australia-bushfires-wildfires-die|title=The world loves kangaroos and koalas.

Loss of habitat also affects already endangered species such as the western ground parrot, the Leadbeater's possum, the Mallee emu-wren (a bird which cannot fly very far), and Gilbert's potoroo. Beekeepers have also lost hives in bushfires.<ref name=\"BBC_22Nov2019\"/>\n\nKangaroos and wallabies can move quickly trying to escape from fires. However, the Guardian reported in January 2020 that dozens, maybe hundreds of kangaroos \"perished in their droves\" as they tried to outrun the flames near Batlow in NSW.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The most resilient animals are those that can burrow or fly. Possums often get singed, but can sometimes hide in tree hollows. Wombats and snakes tend to go underground.<ref name=BBC_22Nov2019/>\n\n[[Goanna]]s can benefit from bushfires. Dickman says: \"In central Australia, we've seen goannas coming out from their burrows after a fire and picking off injured animals \u2013 singed birds, young birds, small mammals, surface-dwelling lizards, and snakes.\"<ref name=BBC_22Nov2019/>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nIn South Australia, Kangaroo Island was devastated when 25,000 Koalas were killed. The island is renowned for its mixture of animal species, and fear that it may never recover its population. Tens of thousands of farm animals, mostly sheep, were also killed in the fire on Kangaroo Island. There are concerns about the survival of endangered species on Kangaroo Island, which include the dunnart (a mouse-like marsupial) and the black glossy cockatoo.\n\n== Impact on humans ==\n\nThe most devastating impact on humans is that bushfires have killed over 800 people since 1851.<ref name=Tronson/> In addition to loss of life, homes, properties, and livestock are destroyed potentially leaving people homeless, traumatised, and without access to electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, to drinking water.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-bushfires-insurance/australia-strengthens-bushfire-defenses-as-economic-environmental-costs-mount-idUSKBN1Z601F Australia strengthens bushfire defenses as economic, environmental costs mount], Reuters, 7 January 2020</ref>\n\n== From 1 November 2019 to 31 January 2020 ==\n\nAt least 33 people have been killed, 4 of which were firefighters.

More than 80 homes were destroyed in South Australia near Adelaide Hills, as well as one-third of the vineyards that provide grapes for the wine industry.\n\n=== Health ===\nBushfires produce particulate-matter pollution \u2013 airborne particles that are small enough to enter and damage human lung tissue. Following the [[Hazelwood Power Station#Coal mine fire|Hazelwood fire]] in 2014, Fay Johnston, an associate professor of public health at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research, says young children exposed to smoke either as infants, toddlers or in the womb develop changes to their lung function.

Sammi Davis stars as Ursula, a sheltered young pupil, then schoolteacher, who's taken under the wing (sexually and otherwise) by the more sophisticated Winifred (Amanda Donohoe). \n\nRussell's film was a companion to his 1969 adaption of Lawrence's second novel about the Brangwen sisters ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920). Glenda Jackson appears as the mother of the character she played in ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969). [[Leonard Maltin]] commented that \"Many beautiful and striking moments don't quite gel, but still worth watching\".

Ursula, since age 3, has a fascination with rainbows and after one rainstorm, she runs off with a suitcase hoping to look for a pot of gold at the end of it. Will tries to ease her fascination by making her a jam sandwich with several spreads of different flavoured jam resembling a rainbow.\n\nDuring her teenage years, Ursula falls into a same sex romance with her older swimming and gym teacher Winifred Inger, while at the same time, Ursula also begins having romantic feelings for Anton Skrebensky, a student at the nearby boys high school who plans to enlist in the Army after graduation. Ursula and Winifred spend romantic weekends together at Winifred's house as well as hiking in the hills around the area. Winifred introduces Ursula to an artist friend of hers whom encourages Ursula to model in the nude for his paintings, and when the artist, Mac, makes sexual advances towards Ursula and refuses to pay her for her modeling, she walks out.\n\nOne weekend, Ursula brings along Winifred as her chaperone when she visits her father's wealthy older brother, Uncle Henry, who becomes smitten with Winifred and, after a short courtship, proposes marriage to her. Winifred accepts which creates jealousy in Ursula.\n\nFeeling abandoned and alone after Winifred leaves her to marry Uncle Henry, and Anton goes off to fight in the Second Boer War in South Africa, Ursula decides to restart her life by becoming a school teacher. After graduation from high school, Ursula moves to London where she takes a job as a schoolmarm at a poor elementary school in the East End where she becomes quickly appalled by the lack of discipline and hygiene among the impoverished children she is forced to teach (many of whom are illiterate child laborers). She also fends off sexual advances by the lecherous headmaster of the school, who uses physical discipline to settle unruly students. Ursula initially refuses to go to that level of physical punishment for her class. But after being provoked a few too many times by one belligerent boy who uses a slingshot to pelt her with small stones, Ursula finally loses her temper and violently beats the child with a cane in full view of the class and school staff. While her violent outburst actually works to pacify her students, and makes the headmaster not to make anymore inappropriate passes at her, Ursula is guilt-ridden by her own actions and as a result, she quits her job when the school year ends.\n\nReturning to her family farm a year-and-a-half later in the spring of 1901, Ursula is reunited with Anton who is back from war and wants to rekindle a romance with her. After having a casual reunion with Winifred, who is married to Uncle Henry and now has a baby, Ursula decides to consummate her romance with Anton. At the same time, Ursula also begins working with a local miners union to help out unprivileged workers with salary and securities. When she learns that she may be pregnant, Anton proposes marriage to her, but she turns him down, wanting to follow her own path in life.\n\nAfter Anton leaves her for good, Ursula is attacked while walking home alone by two mine workers who attempt to rape her, but she escapes and spends most of the day hiding out in a rain-soaked forest, but she makes it back to her farm. There she finds a telegram from Anton who informs her he married another woman and has left the country with her for a military post in India.\n\nAfter a heartfelt talk with her father about life and what path it leads in life, Ursula decides to start all over again by taking another  teaching position in a new town about two hours away. In the final scene, Ursula packs a suitcase and runs out of her house to chase another large rainbow that appears after a storm, just like her younger self used to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Sammi Davis]] as Ursula Brangwen\n* [[Paul McGann]] as Anton Skrebensky\n* [[Amanda Donohoe]] as Winifred Inger\n* [[Christopher Gable]] as Will Brangwen\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Uncle Henry\n* [[Glenda Jackson]] as Anna Brangwen\n* [[Dudley Sutton]] as MacAllister\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Mr. Harby\n* Judith Paris as Miss Harby\n* [[Kenneth Colley]] as Mr. Brunt\n* [[Glenda McKay]] as Gudrun Brangwen\n* Mark Owen as Jim Richards\n* [[Ralph Nossek]] as Vicar\n* [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Ethel\n* Molly Russell as Molly Brangwen\n* Alan Edmondson as Billy Brangwen\n* Rupert Russell as Rupert Brangwen\n* Richard Platt as Chauffeur\n* Bernard Latham as Uncle Alfred\n* [[John Tams]] as Uncle Frank\n* Zoe Brown as Ursula (aged 3)\n* Amy Evans as Baby Gudrun\n* Sam McMullen as Winifred's baby\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nRussell wrote the script in the late 70s after making ''Clouds of Glory'' (1978) for television. He collaborated with Viv Russell and felt it would be a relatively easy film to finance since ''Women in Love'' had been such a success.<ref>Russell p 157</ref> Russell said he was \"well pleased\" with the script \"mainly due to Viv's contribution.\"<ref>Russell p 164</ref> \n\nHe focused on the last third of the novel, the story of Ursula. Russell called it \"a timeless parable.. about a girl who won't stay within the comforting womb of her family but goes off alone to find her own way in life... This film's about saying no I won't because I'm me not you. And it's about a woman saying that in the days they weren't supposed to.\"<ref name=\"derek\"/>\n\n\"It's the same heroines,\" Russell said, \"but they're in their teens rather than in their 20s. It's them growing up and battling all the things that females of all ages have had to do throughout history.\"<ref>At the Movies: [Review]\nLawrence Van Gelder. New York Times 6 May 1988: C.8. </ref> \n\nRussell was optimistic about getting money. \"I was back on home ground in Lawrence country. There was nude wrestling (a man and a woman this time) and stampeding animals (shire horses this time) all that lovely scenery and the usual horny miners.\"<ref>Russell p 195</ref>\n\nHowever all the major studios in Hollywood passed. So too did [[David Puttnam]] who Russell said thought the script was a \"downer\" and that Ursula was a \"pain in the arse\". Puttnam did say he would recommend it to [[Goldcrest Films]] but the director heard nothing further from him.<ref>Russell p 168</ref>\n\nIn 1983 it was reported that Russell had taken an option on the novel.<ref>THE NUCLEAR \"AFTERMATH\" Welsh, James M. Literature/Film Quarterly; Salisbury Vol. 11, Iss. 4,  (1983): 277. </ref>  In January 1984 Russell said he was unable to get finance for the film. \"It seems to me that as the last one did well commercially this would too. But I just can't sell it anywhere. Everyone says 'it's a beautiful script but it's not commercial.' Of course they'd be saying exactly the same thing about ''Women in Love'' if I were trying to sell that now. It's so hard to find anyone with the courage to say yes to anything today.\"<ref>MOVIES: KEN RUSSELL: OPERA HIGHS AFTER FILM LOWS Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 January 1984: r14. </ref>\n\nIn April 1987 Russell said he \"had no luck with\" raising funding for ''The Rainbow'' though he was hopeful to make a movie of a Lawrence novella ''St Mawr''.<ref>WHERE RUSSELL DIRECTS, CONTROVERSY FOLLOWS: [Home Edition] Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 19 April 1987: 29. </ref> \n\nHowever Russell's film ''[[Gothic (film)|Gothic]]'' (1986) became a big success on video, and Vestron told [[Dan Ireland]] that if Russell could come up with a horror movie, they would finance ''The Rainbow''. He signed a three-picture deal with Vestron that included ''Salome's Last Dance'', ''Lair of the White Worm'' and ''The Rainbow''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trailersfromhell.com/blog/2012/05/15/dan-ireland-on-the-lair-of-the-white-worm/ |title=Dan Ireland on The Lair of the White Worm |last=Melville |first=Marty |date=15 May 2012 |work=The Trailers From Hell!

He rewrote the script to lose a dream sequence and a crowd sequence and decided to shoot the film within London and not the Lake District as originally planned. Russell later wrote these changes did not compromise the film - indeed he felt they tightened the script.<ref>Russell p 292-293</ref>\n\nVestron wanted names. They hoped [[Glenda Jackson]] would play the mother of one of the characters in ''Women in Love'' but she was on Broadway at the time. Russell offered the part to [[Julie Christie]] who turned it down. Vestron wanted [[Doug Savant]] to play the English officer but Russell did not think he was suitable. Russell wanted to work with Amanda Donohoe again but Vestron pressed for a name - [[Kelly McGillis]],  [[Mariel Hemingway]] and [[Theresa Russell]] turned it down. [[Catherine Oxenberg]] would not appear nude. Vestron agreed to Sammi Davis in the lead as they had liked her in ''Lair of the White Worm''.

H. Lawrence]] novel ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915). Sammi Davis stars as Ursula, a sheltered young pupil, then schoolteacher, who's taken under the wing (sexually and otherwise) by the more sophisticated Winifred (Amanda Donohoe). \n\nRussell's film was a companion to his 1969 adaption of Lawrence's second novel about the Brangwen sisters ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920). Glenda Jackson appears as the mother of the character she played in ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969). [[Leonard Maltin]] commented that \"Many beautiful and striking moments don't quite gel, but still worth watching\". The film was entered into the [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1989\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=24 March 2013 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316085017/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |archivedate=16 March 2013  }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSet during the final years of England's Victorian era, Ursula Brangwen is the eldest of several children of wealthy Derbyshire farmer Will Brangwen and his wife Anna. Ursula, since age 3, has a fascination with rainbows and after one rainstorm, she runs off with a suitcase hoping to look for a pot of gold at the end of it. Will tries to ease her fascination by making her a jam sandwich with several spreads of different flavoured jam resembling a rainbow.\n\nDuring her teenage years, Ursula falls into a same sex romance with her older swimming and gym teacher Winifred Inger, while at the same time, Ursula also begins having romantic feelings for Anton Skrebensky, a student at the nearby boys high school who plans to enlist in the Army after graduation. Ursula and Winifred spend romantic weekends together at Winifred's house as well as hiking in the hills around the area. Winifred introduces Ursula to an artist friend of hers whom encourages Ursula to model in the nude for his paintings, and when the artist, Mac, makes sexual advances towards Ursula and refuses to pay her for her modeling, she walks out.\n\nOne weekend, Ursula brings along Winifred as her chaperone when she visits her father's wealthy older brother, Uncle Henry, who becomes smitten with Winifred and, after a short courtship, proposes marriage to her. Winifred accepts which creates jealousy in Ursula.\n\nFeeling abandoned and alone after Winifred leaves her to marry Uncle Henry, and Anton goes off to fight in the Second Boer War in South Africa, Ursula decides to restart her life by becoming a school teacher. After graduation from high school, Ursula moves to London where she takes a job as a schoolmarm at a poor elementary school in the East End where she becomes quickly appalled by the lack of discipline and hygiene among the impoverished children she is forced to teach (many of whom are illiterate child laborers). She also fends off sexual advances by the lecherous headmaster of the school, who uses physical discipline to settle unruly students. Ursula initially refuses to go to that level of physical punishment for her class. But after being provoked a few too many times by one belligerent boy who uses a slingshot to pelt her with small stones, Ursula finally loses her temper and violently beats the child with a cane in full view of the class and school staff. While her violent outburst actually works to pacify her students, and makes the headmaster not to make anymore inappropriate passes at her, Ursula is guilt-ridden by her own actions and as a result, she quits her job when the school year ends.\n\nReturning to her family farm a year-and-a-half later in the spring of 1901, Ursula is reunited with Anton who is back from war and wants to rekindle a romance with her. After having a casual reunion with Winifred, who is married to Uncle Henry and now has a baby, Ursula decides to consummate her romance with Anton. At the same time, Ursula also begins working with a local miners union to help out unprivileged workers with salary and securities. When she learns that she may be pregnant, Anton proposes marriage to her, but she turns him down, wanting to follow her own path in life.\n\nAfter Anton leaves her for good, Ursula is attacked while walking home alone by two mine workers who attempt to rape her, but she escapes and spends most of the day hiding out in a rain-soaked forest, but she makes it back to her farm. There she finds a telegram from Anton who informs her that he had gotten married to another woman and has left the country with her for a military post in India.\n\nAfter a heartfelt talk with her father about life and what path it leads in life, Ursula decides to start all over again by taking another  teaching position in a new town about two hours away. In the final scene, Ursula packs a suitcase and runs out of her house to chase another large rainbow that appears after a storm, just like her younger self used to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Sammi Davis]] as Ursula Brangwen\n* [[Paul McGann]] as Anton Skrebensky\n* [[Amanda Donohoe]] as Winifred Inger\n* [[Christopher Gable]] as Will Brangwen\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Uncle Henry\n* [[Glenda Jackson]] as Anna Brangwen\n* [[Dudley Sutton]] as MacAllister\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Mr. Harby\n* Judith Paris as Miss Harby\n* [[Kenneth Colley]] as Mr. Brunt\n* [[Glenda McKay]] as Gudrun Brangwen\n* Mark Owen as Jim Richards\n* [[Ralph Nossek]] as Vicar\n* [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Ethel\n* Molly Russell as Molly Brangwen\n* Alan Edmondson as Billy Brangwen\n* Rupert Russell as Rupert Brangwen\n* Richard Platt as Chauffeur\n* Bernard Latham as Uncle Alfred\n* [[John Tams]] as Uncle Frank\n* Zoe Brown as Ursula (aged 3)\n* Amy Evans as Baby Gudrun\n* Sam McMullen as Winifred's Baby\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nRussell wrote the script in the late 70s after making ''Clouds of Glory'' (1978) for television. He collaborated with Viv Russell and felt it would be a relatively easy film to finance since ''Women in Love'' had been such a success.<ref>Russell p 157</ref> Russell said he was \"well pleased\" with the script \"mainly due to Viv's contribution.\"<ref>Russell p 164</ref> \n\nHe focused on the last third of the novel, the story of Ursula. Russell called it \"a timeless parable.. about a girl who won't stay within the comforting womb of her family but goes off alone to find her own way in life... This film's about saying no I won't because I'm me not you. And it's about a woman saying that in the days they weren't supposed to.\"<ref name=\"derek\"/>\n\n\"It's the same heroines,\" Russell said, \"but they're in their teens rather than in their 20s. It's them growing up and battling all the things that females of all ages have had to do throughout history.\"<ref>At the Movies: [Review]\nLawrence Van Gelder. New York Times 6 May 1988: C.8. </ref> \n\nRussell was optimistic about getting money. \"I was back on home ground in Lawrence country. There was nude wrestling (a man and a woman this time) and stampeding animals (shire horses this time) all that lovely scenery and the usual horny miners.\"<ref>Russell p 195</ref>\n\nHowever all the major studios in Hollywood passed. So too did [[David Puttnam]] who Russell said thought the script was a \"downer\" and that Ursula was a \"pain in the arse\". Puttnam did say he would recommend it to [[Goldcrest Films]] but the director heard nothing further from him.<ref>Russell p 168</ref>\n\nIn 1983 it was reported that Russell had taken an option on the novel.<ref>THE NUCLEAR \"AFTERMATH\" Welsh, James M. Literature/Film Quarterly; Salisbury Vol. 11, Iss. 4,  (1983): 277. </ref>  In January 1984 Russell said he was unable to get finance for the film. \"It seems to me that as the last one did well commercially this would too. But I just can't sell it anywhere. Everyone says 'it's a beautiful script but it's not commercial.' Of course they'd be saying exactly the same thing about ''Women in Love'' if I were trying to sell that now. It's so hard to find anyone with the courage to say yes to anything today.\"<ref>MOVIES: KEN RUSSELL: OPERA HIGHS AFTER FILM LOWS Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 January 1984: r14. </ref>\n\nIn April 1987 Russell said he \"had no luck with\" raising funding for ''The Rainbow'' though he was hopeful to make a movie of a Lawrence novella ''St Mawr''.<ref>WHERE RUSSELL DIRECTS, CONTROVERSY FOLLOWS: [Home Edition] Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 19 April 1987: 29. </ref> \n\nHowever Russell's film ''[[Gothic (film)|Gothic]]'' (1986) became a big success on video, and Vestron told [[Dan Ireland]] that if Russell could come up with a horror movie, they would finance ''The Rainbow''. He signed a three-picture deal with Vestron that included ''Salome's Last Dance'', ''Lair of the White Worm'' and ''The Rainbow''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trailersfromhell.com/blog/2012/05/15/dan-ireland-on-the-lair-of-the-white-worm/ |title=Dan Ireland on The Lair of the White Worm |last=Melville |first=Marty |date=15 May 2012 |work=The Trailers From Hell!

He rewrote the script to lose a dream sequence and a crowd sequence and decided to shoot the film within London and not the Lake District as originally planned. Russell later wrote these changes did not compromise the film - indeed he felt they tightened the script.<ref>Russell p 292-293</ref>\n\nVestron wanted names. They hoped [[Glenda Jackson]] would play the mother of one of the characters in ''Women in Love'' but she was on Broadway at the time. Russell offered the part to [[Julie Christie]] who turned it down. Vestron wanted [[Doug Savant]] to play the English officer but Russell did not think he was suitable. Russell wanted to work with Amanda Donohoe again but Vestron pressed for a name - [[Kelly McGillis]],  [[Mariel Hemingway]] and [[Theresa Russell]] turned it down. [[Catherine Oxenberg]] would not appear nude. Vestron agreed to Sammi Davis in the lead as they had liked her in ''Lair of the White Worm''. [[Charles Dance]] and [[Jeremy Irons]] turned down the role of Davis' father enabling Russell to cast Christopber Gable.<ref>Russell p 292-294</ref>\n\nRussell said Davis \"has exactly the same characteristics as the young Glenda Jackson: a totally instinctive ability to identify with the character she is playing, an emotional directness and that undefinable quality that makes the camera love her.\"<ref name=\"michael\"/>\n\nRussell later said the character of Ursula was \"a bit of a problem to bring off because she's a young woman who is fighting hard for her identity and she could be seen as grumbling all the time... but Sammi transcends all that.\"<ref name=\"derek\"/>\n\nVestron refused to green light to film without names.
