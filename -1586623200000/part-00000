''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = WheatFleet>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| publication-date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = WheatFleet/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = WheatFleet/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc1.cu05600138\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in

Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of

In 2016, the [[Government of India]] honoured her with the [[Padma Shri]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the [[Time 100#2016|100 most influential people in the world]]. In 2017 and 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed her among the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]].\n\nAlthough Chopra initially aspired to study [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]], she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy]]'' (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits ''[[Andaaz]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mujhse Shaadi Karogi]]'' (2004) and received critical acclaim for her [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]] in the 2004 thriller ''[[Aitraaz]]''. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.\n\nFollowing a brief setback, she garnered success in 2008 for playing a troubled model in the drama ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', which won her the [[National Film Award for Best Actress]], and a glamorous journalist in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]''. Chopra gained wider recognition for portraying a range of characters in the films ''[[Kaminey]]'' (2009), ''[[7 Khoon Maaf]]'' (2011), ''[[Barfi!]]'' (2012), ''[[Mary Kom (film)|Mary Kom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015). From 2015 to 2018, she starred as [[Alex Parrish]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] thriller series ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]''. Chopra has since played supporting roles in the Hollywood comedies ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' (2017) and ''[[Isn't It Romantic (2019 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (2019), and returned to Hindi cinema with a leading role in the biopic ''[[The Sky Is Pink]]'' (2019).\n\nChopra also promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights, and is vocal about gender equality, gender pay gap, and feminism.  She has worked with [[UNICEF]] since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to unprivileged Indian children.

One of India's highest-paid and most popular celebrities, Chopra has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Priyanka Chopra|numerous awards]], including one [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and five [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2016, the [[Government of India]] honoured her with the [[Padma Shri]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her one of the [[Time 100#2016|100 most influential people in the world]]. In 2017 and 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed her among the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]].\n\nAlthough Chopra initially aspired to study [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]], she accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy]]'' (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits ''[[Andaaz]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mujhse Shaadi Karogi]]'' (2004) and received critical acclaim for her [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]] in the 2004 thriller ''[[Aitraaz]]''. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in their sequels.\n\nFollowing a brief setback, she garnered success in 2008 for playing a troubled model in the drama ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', which won her the [[National Film Award for Best Actress]], and a glamorous journalist in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]''. Chopra gained wider recognition for portraying a range of characters in the films ''[[Kaminey]]'' (2009), ''[[7 Khoon Maaf]]'' (2011), ''[[Barfi!]]'' (2012), ''[[Mary Kom (film)|Mary Kom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015). From 2015 to 2018, she starred as [[Alex Parrish]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] thriller series ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]''. Chopra has since played supporting roles in the Hollywood comedies ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' (2017) and ''[[Isn't It Romantic (2019 film)|Isn't It Romantic]]'' (2019), and returned to Hindi cinema with a leading role in the biopic ''[[The Sky Is Pink]]'' (2019).\n\nChopra also promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights, and is vocal about gender equality, gender pay gap, and feminism.  She has worked with [[UNICEF]] since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]] for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to unprivileged Indian children. As a recording artist, Chopra has released three [[single (music)|singles]] and provided vocals for a number of her film songs. She is also the founder of the production company [[Purple Pebble Pictures]], under which she has produced several [[Cinema of India#Regional cinema|regional Indians films]], including the acclaimed [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] film ''[[Ventilator (2016 film)|Ventilator]]'' (2016). Despite maintaining privacy, Chopra's off-screen life, including her marriage to the American singer and actor [[Nick Jonas]], is the subject of substantial media coverage.\n\n==Early life==\nPriyanka Chopra was born on 18 July 1982 in [[Jamshedpur]], [[Bihar]] (present-day [[Jharkhand]]), to Ashok and Madhu Chopra, both physicians in the [[Indian Army]].<ref name=bday1>{{cite web|title=Birthday Special: 30 Facts About Priyanka Chopra |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-birthday-special-priyanka-chopra/20120718.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926075555/http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-birthday-special-priyanka-chopra/20120718.htm |archivedate=26 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=bday2>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Birthday-blast-Priyanka-Chopra-s-Top-30-moments-in-showbiz/Article1-890611.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718055252/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Birthday-blast-Priyanka-Chopra-s-Top-30-moments-in-showbiz/Article1-890611.aspx|archivedate=18 July 2012|title=Birthday blast: Priyanka Chopra's Top 30 moments in showbiz |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=17 July 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Her father was a [[Punjabi Hindu]] from [[Ambala]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"I'll get married six times\" \u2013 Priyanka Chopra |url=http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/ill-get-married-six-times-priyanka-chopra-4412.html |work=[[Filmfare]] |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806083606/http://www.filmfare.com/interviews/ill-get-married-six-times-priyanka-chopra-4412.html |archivedate= 6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priyanka-Chopra-missed-visiting-her-hometown-Ambala/articleshow/47502145.cms |title=Priyanka Chopra missed visiting her hometown Ambala |author=Batra, Ankur |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708160043/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priyanka-Chopra-missed-visiting-her-hometown-Ambala/articleshow/47502145.cms |archivedate= 8 July 2015}}</ref> Her mother Madhu Chopra from Jharkhand, is the eldest daughter of Dr. Manohar Kishan Akhouri, a former [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] veteran<ref>{{cite web|title=Much ado about Adieu |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Much-ado-about-Adieu/2016/06/12/article3478145.ece |author=Chandran, Abhilash |work=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=12 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613134407/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Much-ado-about-Adieu/2016/06/12/article3478145.ece |archivedate=13 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyanka-chopra-harassed-by-unknown-man/143892-8-66.html |title=Priyanka Chopra harassed by unknown man |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204003258/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/priyanka-chopra-harassed-by-unknown-man/143892-8-66.html |archivedate= 4 December 2013}}</ref> and Madhu Jyotsna Akhouri (n\u00e9e Mary John), a former member of [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]].

It involves the exploration of one's body in relationship to others by using the fundamentals of sharing weight, touch, and movement awareness.\n\nAmerican dancer and choreographer [[Steve Paxton]] originated Contact Improvisation, drawing from his past training in [[aikido]], a martial art form, to explore and push boundaries with his colleagues and students to develop this new practice. Contact Improvisation plays with the artistry of falling off balance, counterbalance, finding the shelves of the body, learning the mechanics of the body in order to handle someone else's weight or be lifted, breathing techniques, and can involve the art of getting to know your partner past the physical point through the physicality.\n\n[[Steve Paxton]], along with many other pioneers such as [[Nancy Stark Smith]], Danny Lepkoff, [[Lisa Nelson]], Karen Nelson, Nita Little, Andrew Harwood, and Ray Chung, thus participated in creating an \"art-sport\", oscillating between different emphases depending on the moments and personalities who practice it:\n* '''experimental dance''' (practice-based research organized in dance laboratories),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Landscape of the Now: A Topography of Movement Improvisation|last=Spain|first=Kent De|date=2014-07-02|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199988266|language=English}}</ref><ref name=\":6\" />\n* '''theatrical form''' (improvised performances, lectures-demonstrations...),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dance As a Theatre Art: Source Readings in Dance History from 1581 to the Present|last=|first=|date=1992-12-01|publisher=Princeton Book Company|isbn=9780871271730|editor-last=Cohen|editor-first=Selma Jeanne|edition=2nd|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/danceastheatrear00selm/page/222 222]|language=English|editor-last2=Matheson|editor-first2=Katy|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/danceastheatrear00selm/page/222}}</ref>\n* '''educational tool''' (classical training for professional and non-professional dancers in improvisation and in partnering)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Moment of Movement: Dance Improvisation|last=Blom|first=Lynne Anne|last2=Chaplin|first2=L.

According to one of its first practitioners, [[Nancy Stark Smith]], it \u00ab '''resembles other familiar duet forms, such as the embrace, wrestling, surfing, martial arts, and the jitterbug''', encompassing a wide range of movement from stillness to highly athletic. \u00bb<ref name=\":5\">Nancy Stark Smith et David Koteen (2013), ''Caught Falling. The Confluence of Contact Improvisation, Nancy Stark Smith, and Other Moving Ideas'', Contact Editions, p. xii</ref>\n\nVarious definitions establish in their own ways what was at stake in a Contact Improvisation duo. [[Steve Paxton]] proposed the following in 1979: <blockquote>\u00ab The exigencies of the form dictate a mode of movement which is relaxed, constantly aware and prepared, and onflowing. As a basic focus, '''the dancers remain in physical touch, mutually supportive and innovative, meditating upon the physical laws relating to their masses: gravity, momentum, inertia, and friction'''.

For several weeks, he offered Oberlin students two sets of practices:\n# every morning at dawn, a \"soft class\" involving an exploration that he soon called the ''Small Dance'', a '''form of meditation that is practiced standing, where attention is paid to postural adjustments and micro-weight transfers''';<ref>Steve Paxton, \" Why Standing? \", ''Contact Quarterly'', 2015</ref>\n# and later in the day, rehearsals for a performance that he transmitted to a group of young men and whose score is to explore the extremes of movement and disorientation, '''from standing still to falling, rolling, colliding, and jumping in the air'''. For these rehearsals, Steve Paxton relied on his training in modern dance (he had danced in the companies of [[Jos\u00e9 Limon]] and [[Merce Cunningham]]), in [[Aikido]] and in [[gymnastics]].\nThe meeting of these practices gives rise to '''''Magnesium'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://contactquarterly.com/contact-editions/index.php#book=videoda-contact-improvisation-archive-(dvd)|title=Contact Editions dance and somatics books & dvds|website=contactquarterly.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>''', a twenty-minute long piece where dancers perform on gym mats, jump and bump into each other, manipulate and cling to one another'''.  \"In this performance, dancers usually use their bodies as a whole, all parts are simultaneously unbalanced or thrown against another body or in the air.\"<ref name=\":0\">Novack, Cynthia Jean., ''Sharing the dance'', Univ.

The syncopated, risky, raw and awkward style of the first performances gave place rather quickly to a variety of aesthetics within the form.\n\nOne of those aesthetics was the development of smooth, continuous, controlled flow of quality in the late 70s and early 80s, running parallel with the opposite trend of interest in conflict and unexpected responses, including previously avoided eye contact and direct hand contact.<ref>Novack, 1990 op cit p. 156-8.</ref> Says [[Nancy Stark Smith]],\n\n[[File:NSSLittle1976 & nita CI 76 jump uldis ohaks.tif|thumb|left|Nancy Stark Smith (left) and Nita Little, in a ''ReUnion'' concert (with Steve Paxton, David Woodberry and Curt Siddall) at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], 1976.

This idea was rejected in favor of establishing a forum for communication: this became the ''Contact Newsletter'' founded by [[Nancy Stark Smith]], which evolved into the bi-annual journal [https://contactquarterly.com/ ''Contact Quarterly'']<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nancy|title=A question of copyright - some history|journal=Contact Quarterly: A Vehicle for Moving Ideas|year=1998|volume=23|issue=1|page=35}}</ref> which continues to be published by the non-profit organisation ''Contact Collaborations'' (incorporated in 1978).<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.contactquarterly.com/about/cq_aboutus.php|publisher=Contact Collaborations|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> The journal, now co-edited by [[Nancy Stark Smith]] and Lisa Nelson, brings together different reflections of CI teachers and practitioners and cements an international community by equipping it with a communication organ, as well as hosting several other orders of reflections, including [[contemporary dance]]rs and [[Somatics|somatic practitioners]] writings. According to the magazine's statement,<blockquote>''\"Contact Quarterly'' is the longest living, independent, artist-made, not-for-profit, reader-supported magazine devoted to the dancer's voice. Founded in 1975, Contact Quarterly (CQ) began as a forum for discussion of the emerging dance form Contact Improvisation. Serving as a meeting ground for a worldwide network of contact improvisers, CQ quickly grew to include writings and interviews on postmodern and contemporary experimental dance, somatic movement practices, improvisational dance, mixed-abilities dance, teaching methods, creative process, and performance.<ref name=\":2\" />\"</blockquote>While the development of Contact Improvisation has benefited greatly from Nancy Stark Smith and Lisa Nelson's editorial work to support the writings of dancers in their exploration of the form, it also owes much to the '''cameras of Steve Christiansen and then Lisa Nelson, who documented many moments of the work (especially in performance) and allow the contactors to observe themselves with meticulousness'''.[[File:CIJam.jpg|thumb|left|Contact Improvisation jam in Montpellier, France (2004]]\n\n==== Development of Art-Sport ====\n\nSince the mid-1970s, regular jams are present in most major cities in North America (New York City, Boston, San Francisco, Montreal ...).

It involves the exploration of one's body in relationship to others by using the fundamentals of sharing weight, touch, and movement awareness.\n\nAmerican dancer and choreographer [[Steve Paxton]] originated Contact Improvisation, drawing from his past training in [[aikido]], a martial art form, to explore and push boundaries with his colleagues and students to develop this new practice. Contact Improvisation plays with the artistry of falling off balance, counterbalance, finding the shelves of the body, learning the mechanics of the body in order to handle someone else's weight or be lifted, breathing techniques, and can involve the art of getting to know your partner past the physical point through the physicality.\n\n[[Steve Paxton]], along with many other pioneers such as [[Nancy Stark Smith]], Danny Lepkoff, [[Lisa Nelson]], Karen Nelson, Nita Little, Andrew Harwood, and Ray Chung, thus participated in creating an \"art-sport\", oscillating between different emphases depending on the moments and personalities who practice it:\n* '''experimental dance''' (practice-based research organized in dance laboratories),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Landscape of the Now: A Topography of Movement Improvisation|last=Spain|first=Kent De|date=2014-07-02|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199988266|language=English}}</ref><ref name=\":6\" />\n* '''theatrical form''' (improvised performances, lectures-demonstrations...),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dance As a Theatre Art: Source Readings in Dance History from 1581 to the Present|last=|first=|date=1992-12-01|publisher=Princeton Book Company|isbn=9780871271730|editor-last=Cohen|editor-first=Selma Jeanne|edition=2nd|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/danceastheatrear00selm/page/222 222]|language=English|editor-last2=Matheson|editor-first2=Katy|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/danceastheatrear00selm/page/222}}</ref>\n* '''educational tool''' (classical training for professional and non-professional dancers in improvisation and in partnering)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Moment of Movement: Dance Improvisation|last=Blom|first=Lynne Anne|last2=Chaplin|first2=L.

According to one of its first practitioners, [[Nancy Stark Smith]], it \u00ab '''resembles other familiar duet forms, such as the embrace, wrestling, surfing, martial arts, and the jitterbug''', encompassing a wide range of movement from stillness to highly athletic. \u00bb<ref name=\":5\">Nancy Stark Smith et David Koteen (2013), ''Caught Falling. The Confluence of Contact Improvisation, Nancy Stark Smith, and Other Moving Ideas'', Contact Editions, p. xii</ref>\n\nVarious definitions establish in their own ways what was at stake in a Contact Improvisation duo. [[Steve Paxton]] proposed the following in 1979: <blockquote>\u00ab The exigencies of the form dictate a mode of movement which is relaxed, constantly aware and prepared, and onflowing. As a basic focus, '''the dancers remain in physical touch, mutually supportive and innovative, meditating upon the physical laws relating to their masses: gravity, momentum, inertia, and friction'''. They do not strive to achieve results, but rather, to meet the constantly changing physical reality with appropriate placement and energy. \u00bb<ref>Steve Paxton, \"A Definition\", ''Contact Quarterly'', Winter 1979, p. 26.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History of Contact Improvisation==\n\n=== From ''Magnesium'' to ''Contact Improvisations'' ===\nContact Improvisation was developed in the [[United States]] in the 1970s by a group of dancers and athletes gathered for the first time under the impetus of choreographer and dancer [[Steve Paxton]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn January 1972, Steve Paxton was in residence at [[Oberlin College]] on a tour with [[Grand Union (dance group)|Grand Union]], a collective where he collaborated among others with [[Yvonne Rainer]] and [[Trisha Brown]].  For several weeks, he offered Oberlin students two sets of practices:\n# every morning at dawn, a \"soft class\" involving an exploration that he soon called the ''Small Dance'', a '''form of meditation that is practiced standing, where attention is paid to postural adjustments and micro-weight transfers''';<ref>Steve Paxton, \" Why Standing? \", ''Contact Quarterly'', 2015</ref>\n# and later in the day, rehearsals for a performance that he transmitted to a group of young men and whose score is to explore the extremes of movement and disorientation, '''from standing still to falling, rolling, colliding, and jumping in the air'''. For these rehearsals, Steve Paxton relied on his training in modern dance (he had danced in the companies of [[Jos\u00e9 Limon]] and [[Merce Cunningham]]), in [[Aikido]] and in [[gymnastics]].\nThe meeting of these practices gives rise to '''''Magnesium'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://contactquarterly.com/contact-editions/index.php#book=videoda-contact-improvisation-archive-(dvd)|title=Contact Editions dance and somatics books & dvds|website=contactquarterly.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>''', a twenty-minute long piece where dancers perform on gym mats, jump and bump into each other, manipulate and cling to one another'''.  \"In this performance, dancers usually use their bodies as a whole, all parts are simultaneously unbalanced or thrown against another body or in the air.\"<ref name=\":0\">Novack, Cynthia Jean., ''Sharing the dance'', Univ.

He invited some colleagues from the [[Judson Dance Theater]] years like [[Barbara Dilley]] and Nancy Topf, [[Release Technique]] pioneer [[Mary Fulkerson]], as well as students met during his teaching tours, including [[Nancy Stark Smith]] and Curt Siddall (from [[Oberlin College]]), Danny Lepkoff and David Woodberry (from the [[University of Rochester]], where Mary Fulkerson was a teacher) and Nita Little (from [[Bennington College]]).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the end of this week of residency, the group presented a performance which Steve Paxton named ''Contact Improvisations''. They presented it in the form of a permanent afternoon practice for five days, at the John Weber Gallery in Manhattan, which at the same time showcased a film by [[George Manupelli]], ''Dr. Chicago'', and where spectators could come and go as the practice continues.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== In North America ===\n\n==== Styles ====\nFollowing the first performance of ''Contact Improvisations'' in New York in 1972, the participants scattered to different parts of the [[United States]] but soon began to teach the practice. The syncopated, risky, raw and awkward style of the first performances gave place rather quickly to a variety of aesthetics within the form.\n\nOne of those aesthetics was the development of smooth, continuous, controlled flow of quality in the late 70s and early 80s, running parallel with the opposite trend of interest in conflict and unexpected responses, including previously avoided eye contact and direct hand contact.<ref>Novack, 1990 op cit p. 156-8.</ref> Says [[Nancy Stark Smith]],\n\n[[File:NSSLittle1976 & nita CI 76 jump uldis ohaks.tif|thumb|left|Nancy Stark Smith (left) and Nita Little, in a ''ReUnion'' concert (with Steve Paxton, David Woodberry and Curt Siddall) at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], 1976.

This idea was rejected in favor of establishing a forum for communication: this became the ''Contact Newsletter'' founded by [[Nancy Stark Smith]], which evolved into the bi-annual journal [https://contactquarterly.com/ ''Contact Quarterly'']<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nancy|title=A question of copyright - some history|journal=Contact Quarterly: A Vehicle for Moving Ideas|year=1998|volume=23|issue=1|page=35}}</ref> which continues to be published by the non-profit organisation ''Contact Collaborations'' (incorporated in 1978).<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.contactquarterly.com/about/cq_aboutus.php|publisher=Contact Collaborations|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> The journal, now co-edited by [[Nancy Stark Smith]] and Lisa Nelson, brings together different reflections of CI teachers and practitioners and cements an international community by equipping it with a communication organ, as well as hosting several other orders of reflections, including [[contemporary dance]]rs and [[Somatics|somatic practitioners]] writings. According to the magazine's statement,<blockquote>''\"Contact Quarterly'' is the longest living, independent, artist-made, not-for-profit, reader-supported magazine devoted to the dancer's voice. Founded in 1975, Contact Quarterly (CQ) began as a forum for discussion of the emerging dance form Contact Improvisation. Serving as a meeting ground for a worldwide network of contact improvisers, CQ quickly grew to include writings and interviews on postmodern and contemporary experimental dance, somatic movement practices, improvisational dance, mixed-abilities dance, teaching methods, creative process, and performance.<ref name=\":2\" />\"</blockquote>While the development of Contact Improvisation has benefited greatly from Nancy Stark Smith and Lisa Nelson's editorial work to support the writings of dancers in their exploration of the form, it also owes much to the '''cameras of Steve Christiansen and then Lisa Nelson, who documented many moments of the work (especially in performance) and allow the contactors to observe themselves with meticulousness'''.[[File:CIJam.jpg|thumb|left|Contact Improvisation jam in Montpellier, France (2004]]\n\n==== Development of Art-Sport ====\n\nSince the mid-1970s, regular jams are present in most major cities in North America (New York City, Boston, San Francisco, Montreal ...).

In Belgium, where Steve Paxton had come since the 80s, invited by the Klapstuk and the Kaaitheater, few professional dancers regularly practised it and apart from certain outbreaks of fever in successful jams, it can not be said that Contact Improvisation left any lasting trace among professional dancers, except in a choreographed form.<ref name=\":1\">Patricia Kuypers, ''Nouvelles de danse'', <abbr>Vol.</abbr>  38-39, Bruxelles, 1999</ref>\n\n==== In France ====\nIn France, Contact Improvisation (sometimes called \"danse-contact\", as in French-speaking Canada) was introduced for the first time in 1978, where a Contact Improvisation course was given by Steve Paxton and Lisa Nelson during the musical festivities of Sainte Beaume:<blockquote>\"Didier Silhol, [[Mark Tompkins (dancer)|Mark Tompkins]], Suzanne Cotto, Edith Veyron and Martine Muffat-Joly attended.

Here it must be emphasized that despite the use of the term \u201cinward focus\u201d in Novack\u2019s account, the cultivation of kinaesthetic awareness cannot be equated with an \u201cintrospective\u201d preoccupation with private sensations; rather, the accent lies on sensing-through the responsive body, combining both \u201cinternal awareness\u201d and \u201cresponsiveness to another\u201d.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Behnke|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2003-01-01|title=Contact Improvisation and the Lived World|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BEHCIA|journal=Studia Phaenomenologica|volume=3|issue=Special|pages=39\u201361|doi=10.7761/SP.3.S1.39}}</ref></blockquote>[[Steve Paxton]] insisted on this aspect with the concept of '''''interior techniques'' involving in the dance practice a training of perception''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahk.nl/fileadmin/download/theaterschool/talk/talk-training-perception.pdf|title=Training perception|last=Steve Paxton|date=2006}}</ref> resting on investigations based on the sciences of the senses (physiology, experimental and [[ecological psychology]], anatomy, behaviour sciences).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Robert|date=2010-08-25|title=Steve Paxton's \"Interior Techniques\": Contact Improvisation and Political Power|journal=TDR/The Drama Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=123\u2013135|doi=10.1162/DRAM_a_00007|issn=1054-2043}}</ref>\n\n[[Lisa Nelson]], in that regard, occupied a special place in the effervescence of the development of CI.
