They are sometimes called '''laser thermometers''' as a [[laser]] is used to help aim the thermometer, or '''non-contact thermometers''' or '''temperature guns''', to describe the device's ability to measure temperature from a distance. By knowing the amount of [[infrared]] energy emitted by the object and its [[emissivity]], the object's temperature can often be determined within a certain range of its actual temperature. Infrared thermometers are a subset of devices known as \"thermal radiation thermometers\".\n\nSometimes, especially near ambient temperatures, readings may be subject to error due to the reflection of radiation from a hotter body\u2014even the person holding the instrument{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}&nbsp;\u2014 rather than radiated by the object being measured, and to an incorrectly assumed emissivity.\n\nThe design essentially consists of a lens to focus the infrared [[thermal radiation]] on to a [[detector]], which converts the radiant power to an [[electrical]] signal that can be displayed in units of temperature after being compensated for ambient temperature.  This permits temperature measurement from a distance without contact with the object to be measured. A non-contact infrared thermometer is useful for measuring temperature under circumstances where [[thermocouples]] or other probe-type sensors cannot be used or do not produce accurate data for a variety of reasons.\n\n== Examples of use ==\nSome typical circumstances are where the object to be measured is moving; where the object is surrounded by an [[electromagnetic field]], as in [[induction heating]]; where the object is contained in a [[vacuum]] or another controlled atmosphere; or in applications where a fast response is required, the accurate surface temperature is desired or the object temperature is above the recommended use point for contact sensors, or contact with a sensor would mar the object or the sensor, or introduce a significant temperature gradient on the object's surface.\n\nInfrared thermometers can be used to serve a wide variety of temperature monitoring functions. A few examples provided include detecting clouds for remote telescope operation, checking mechanical or electrical equipment for temperature and hot spots, measuring the temperature of patients in a hospital without touching them, checking heater or oven temperature, for calibration and control, checking for hot spots in fire-fighting, monitoring materials in processes involving heating or cooling, and measuring the temperature of volcanoes. At times of epidemics of diseases causing fever, such as [[SARS coronavirus]] and [[Ebola virus disease]], infrared thermometers have been used to check arriving travelers for fever.<ref>[http://www.irinfo.org/06-01-2003-seffrin/ Thermal Imaging for Detecting Potential SARS Infection] (also covers non-imaging infrared thermometers)</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2014/10/18/a-roissy-le-thermometre-laser-pour-detecter-ebola_1124527 | title=A Roissy, le \"thermom\u00e8tre laser\" pour d\u00e9tecter Ebola | date=2014-10-18 | publisher=[[Lib\u00e9ration]] |quote='' A peine descends d\u2019avion, les passagers du vol Conakry-Paris ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillis samedi avec des thermom\u00e8tres laser pour d\u00e9tecter d\u2019\u00e9ventuels cas de fi\u00e8vre, mesure la plus spectaculaire prise par le gouvernement pour pr\u00e9venir l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle arriv\u00e9e en France du virus Ebola'' | accessdate=2014-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThere are many varieties of infrared temperature-sensing devices, both for portable and handheld use and as fixed installations.\n\n== Accuracy ==\nInfrared thermometers are characterized by specifications including accuracy and angular coverage. Simpler instruments may have a measurement error of about \u00b12&nbsp;\u00b0C or \u00b14&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe distance-to-spot ratio (D:S) is the ratio of the distance to the measurement surface and the diameter of the temperature measurement area.  For instance, if the D:S ratio is 12:1, the diameter of the measurement area is one-twelfth of the distance to the object.  A thermometer with a higher ratio of D to S is able to sense a more-specific, narrower surface at a greater distance than one with a lower ratio.  A 12:1 rated device can sense a 1-inch circle at a distance of one foot, whereas a 10:1 ratio device achieves the same 1-inch circle at 10 inches, and a wider, less-specific circle of 1.2 inches at a distance of 12 inches.\n\nThe ideal target area should be at least twice the size of the spot at that distance,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firecraftsafety.com/pdf/IR%20Thermometers%20explained.pdf| title=Infrared thermometers explained|publisher=FireCraft Safety.com}}</ref> with smaller areas relative to distance resulting in less accurate measurement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  An infrared thermometer cannot be placed too close to its target, or this proximity causes heat to build up in the thermometer's housing and damages the sensor. Measurement error generally only decreases with too much distance because of the effects of reflectivity and the inclusion of other heat sources within the sensor's field of view.<ref>{{cite book|title=Research & Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vacoAQAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|page=31}}</ref><ref name=\"Barker1985\">{{cite book|author=J.

Some sensors have an adjustable emissivity setting, which can be set to measure the temperature of reflective and non-reflective surfaces.  A non-adjustable thermometer may be used to measure the temperature of a reflective surface by applying a non-reflective paint or tape, with some loss of accuracy.\n\nA sensor with an adjustable emissivity setting can also be used to calibrate the sensor for a given surface or to measure the emissivity of a surface.  When the temperature of a surface is accurately known (e.g. by measuring with a contact thermometer), then the sensor's emissivity setting can be adjusted until the temperature measurement by the IR method matches the measured temperature by the contact method; the emissivity setting will indicate the emissivity of the surface, which can be taken into account for later measurements of similar surfaces (only).\n\n== Infrared pyrometer  ==\nThe most common infrared thermometer is the spot infrared pyrometer or infrared [[pyrometer]], which measures the temperature at a spot on a surface (actually a relatively small area determined by the D:S ratio). These usually project a visible red dot onto the center of the area being measured that identifies the spot being measured, but plays no part in the measurement. The actual angular area being measured varies among instruments and is not restricted to the visible spot.\n\nRelated equipment, although not strictly thermometers, include infrared scanning systems and infrared thermal imaging cameras. Infrared scanning systems scan a larger area, typically by using what is essentially a spot thermometer pointed at a rotating mirror. These devices are widely used in manufacturing involving conveyors or \"web\" processes, such as large sheets of glass or metal exiting an oven, fabric, and paper, or continuous piles of material along a conveyor belt. Infrared thermal imaging cameras or [[Thermographic camera|infrared cameras]] are essentially infrared radiation thermometers that measure the temperature at many points over a relatively large area to generate a two-dimensional image, called a [[Thermography|thermogram]], with each pixel representing a temperature. This technology is more processor- and software-intensive than spot or scanning thermometers, and is used for monitoring large areas. Typical applications include perimeter monitoring used by military or security personnel, inspection/process quality monitoring of manufacturing processes, and equipment or enclosed space hot or cold spot monitoring for safety and efficiency maintenance purposes.\n\nA [[photographic]] [[camera]] using [[infrared photography|infrared film]] and suitable lens, etc., is also called an \"infrared camera\". This only captures the near-infrared and is not sensitive to the thermal radiation from room-temperature objects.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:IR_Thermometer_1.jpg|An early model of the [[Thermofocus]] IR thermometer\nImage:IR_Thermometer_2.jpg|A medical IR thermometer in use, with the light indicating the measured area.\nImage: Infrared thermometer.JPG|An IR thermometer use in industry\nFile:Infrared_thermometer_training.jpg|Training with a medical IR thermometer\nFile:Infrared_thermometer_(Innovo).jpg|Example medical IR thermometer\nFile:BodyPlus_Infrarot-Thermometer.png|Example medical IR thermometer\nFile:Digital_IR-Thermometer.jpg|Example medical IR thermometer\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ASTM Subcommittee E20.02 on Radiation Thermometry]]\n* [[Bolometer]]\n* [[Pyrometer]]\n* [[Sakuma\u2013Hattori equation]]\n* [[Thermographic camera]]\n* [[Thermography]]\n* [[Laser Infrared Thermometer]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dksecurities.in/Medk%20Secure.html#header4-17|title=Medk Secure {{!}} Laser Infrared Thermometer {{!}} PEE kit|website=www.dksecurities.in|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n \n\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Thermography}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140725223655/http://www.irinfo.org/Articles/07-01-2014-gilbertson.pdf Avoiding Common Mistakes that Can Compromise an Infrared Inspection Program]\n*[http://www.omega.com/prodinfo/infraredthermometer.html Introduction to Infrared Thermometers \u2013 Omega]\n\n{{Sensors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Infrared Thermometer}}\n[[Category:Thermometers]]\n[[Category:NASA spin-off technologies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{cleanup|date=June 2011}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1024 Pyrometer-8445.jpg|200px|thumbnail|An infrared thermometer.]]\n[[Image: Pyrometer 040824.jpg|thumb|upright|A sailor checking the temperature of a ventilation system]]\nAn '''infrared thermometer''' is a [[thermometer]] which infers temperature from a portion of the [[thermal radiation]] sometimes called [[black-body radiation]] emitted by the object being measured.

{"title_page": "Complexity (information theory)", "text_new": "'''Information complexity''' is an information-theoretic quantity defined as the fluctuation of information about [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]. It is derivable from fluctuations in the predominance of order and chaos in a dynamic system and has been used as a measure of complexity in many diverse fields. It was introduced in a 1993 paper by Bates and Shepard.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John E.|last2=Shepard|first2=Harvey K.|date=1993-01-18|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019390232O|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=172|issue=6|pages=416\u2013425|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(93)90232-O|issn=0375-9601}}</ref>.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe information complexity of a discrete dynamic system is a function of the [[probability distribution]] of its states when it is subject to random external input data. The purpose of driving the system with a rich information source such as a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] or a [[White noise|white noise signal]] is to probe the internal dynamics of the system much the same as a [[impulse response|frequency-rich impulse]] is used in [[signal processing]]. \n\nIf a system has <math display=\"inline\">N</math> possible states and the ''state probabilities'' <math display=\"inline\">p_i</math>are known, then its [[Entropy (information theory)#Definition|information entropy]] is\n\n: <math>\\Eta = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i I_i = - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">I_i = -\\log p_i</math> is the [[information content]] of state <math display=\"inline\">i</math>.\n\nThe '''information complexity''' of the system is defined as the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] or fluctuation of <math display=\"inline\">I</math> about its mean <math display=\"inline\">\\Eta</math>:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(I_i - \\Eta)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_iI_i^2 - \\Eta^2}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log^2 p_i - \\Biggl(\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i \\Biggr)^2}.</math>\n\nThe ''fluctuation of state information'' <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is zero in a maximally disordered system with all <math>p_i = 1/N</math>; the system simply mimics its random inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is also zero when the system is perfectly ordered with just one fixed state <math>(p_1 = 1)</math>, regardless of inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is non-zero between these two extremes with a mixture of both higher-probability states and lower-probability states populating [[state space]].\n\n== Fluctuation of information allows for memory and computation ==\n\nAs a complex dynamic system evolves in time, how it transitions between states depends on external stimuli in an irregular way. At times it may be more sensitive to external stimuli (unstable) and at other times less sensitive (stable). If a particular state has several possible next-states, external information determines which one will be next and the system gains that information by following a particular trajectory in state space. But if several different states all lead to the same next-state, then upon entering the next-state the system loses information about which state preceded it. Thus, a complex system exhibits alternating information gain and loss as it evolves in time. The alternation or fluctuation of information is equivalent to remembering and forgetting \u2014 temporary information storage or memory \u2014 an essential feature of non-trivial computation. \n\nThe gain or loss of information associated with transitions between states can be related to state information. The ''net information gain'' of a transition from state <math>i</math> to state <math>j</math> is the information gained when leaving state <math>i</math> less the information lost when entering state <math>j</math>:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log p_{i \\rightarrow j} + \\log p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nHere <math display=\"inline\">p_{i \\rightarrow j}</math> is the ''forward conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>i</math> then the next state is <math>j</math> and <math>p_{i \\leftarrow j}</math> is the ''reverse conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>j</math> then the previous state was <math>i\n</math>. The conditional probabilities are related to the ''transition probability'' <math>p_{ij}</math>, the probability that a transition from state <math>i\n</math> to state <math>j</math> occurs, by:\n\n: <math>p_{ij} = p_i p_{i \\rightarrow j} = p_j p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nEliminating the conditional probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log (p_{ij}/p_i) + \\log (p_{ij}/p_j) = \\log p_i - \\log p_j = I_j - I_i.</math>\n\nTherefore the net information gained by the system as a result of the transition depends only on the increase in state information from the initial to the final state. It can be shown that this is true even for multiple consecutive transitions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<math>\\Gamma = \\Delta I</math> is reminiscent of the relation between force and [[Potential energy#Derivable from a potential|potential energy]]. <math>I</math> is like potential <math>\\Phi</math> and <math>\\Gamma</math> is like force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> in [[Potential energy#Derivable_from_a_potential|<math>\\mathbf{F}={\\nabla \\Phi}</math>]]. External information \u201cpushes\u201d a system \u201cuphill\u201d to a state of higher information potential to accomplish memory storage, much like pushing a mass uphill to a state of higher gravitational potential stores energy. The amount of energy storage depends only on the final height, not the path up the hill. Likewise, the amount of information storage does not depend on the transition path between two states in state space. Once a system reaches a rare state with high information potential, it may \"fall\" to a more common state, losing the previously stored information.\n\nIt may be useful to compute the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] of <math>\\Gamma</math> about its mean (which is zero), namely the ''fluctuation of net information gain'' <math>\\sigma_\\Gamma</math><ref name=\":0\" />, but <math>\\sigma_I</math> takes into account multi-transition ''memory loops'' in state space and therefore should be a better indicator of the computational power of a system. Moreover, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is easier to calculate because there can be many more transitions than states.  \n\n== Chaos and order ==\nA dynamic system that is sensitive to external information (unstable) exhibits [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior whereas one that is insensitive to external information (stable) exhibits orderly behavior. A complex system exhibits both behaviors, fluctuating between them in dynamic balance when subject to a rich information source. The degree of fluctuation is quantified by <math>\\sigma_I</math>; it captures the alternation in the predominance of chaos and order in a complex system as it evolves in time.\n\n== Example: rule 110 variant of the elementary cellular automaton ==\nThe [[rule 110]]  variant of the [[elementary cellular automaton]] has been [[Rule 110#The proof of universality|proven]] to be capable of [[universal computation]]. The proof is based on the existence and interactions of cohesive and self-perpetuating cell patterns known as gliders or [[Rule 110#Spaceships in Rule 110|spaceships]], [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent]] phenomena, that imply the capability of groups of automaton cells to remember that a glider is passing through them. It is therefore to be expected that there will be memory loops in state space resulting from alternations of information gain and loss, instability and stability, chaos and order.\n\nConsider a 3-cell group of adjacent automaton cells that obey rule 110: <math>\\text{end-center-end}</math>. The next state of the center cell depends on the present state of itself and the end cells as specified by the rule:   \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Elementary cellular automaton rule 110.\n!3-cell group\n|1-1-1\n|1-1-0\n|1-0-1\n|1-0-0\n|0-1-1\n|0-1-0\n|0-0-1\n|0-0-0\n|-\n!next center cell\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|}\n\nTo calculate the information complexity of this system, attach a ''driver cell'' to each end of the 3-cell group to provide a random external stimulus like so, <math>\\text{driver} \\rightarrow \\text{end-center-end} \\leftarrow \\text{driver}</math>, such that the rule can be applied to the two end cells. Next determine what the next state is for each possible present state and for each possible combination of driver cell contents, to determine the forward conditional probabilities. \n\nThe [[state diagram]] of this system is depicted below, with circles representing the states and arrows representing transitions between states. The eight states of this system, <math>1-1-1</math> to <math>0-0-0</math> are labeled with the decimal equivalent of the 3-bit contents of the 3-cell group: 7 to 0. The transition arrows are labeled with forward conditional probabilities. Notice that there is variability in the divergence and convergence of arrows corresponding to a variability in chaos and order, sensitivity and insensitivity, gain and loss of external information from the driver cells. \n[[File:State_diagram_for_rule_110_with_transition_probabilities.jpg|alt=|border|none|frame|'''The 3-cell state diagram for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton showing forward conditional transition probabilities with random stimulation.''']]\n\nThe forward conditional probabilities are determined by the ratio of possible driver cell contents that drive a particular transition. For example, for the four possible combinations of two driver cell contents, state 7 leads to states 5, 4, 1 and 0 so <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 5}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 4}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 1}</math>, and <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 0}</math> are each 1/4 or 25%. Likewise, state 0 leads to states 0, 1, 0 and 1 so <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 1}</math>and <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 0}</math>are each 1/2 or 50%. And so forth.\n\nThe state probabilities are related by\n\n: <math>p_j = \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i  p_{i \\rightarrow j} \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i = 1.</math>\n\nThese linear algebraic equations can be solved manually or with the aid of a computer program for the state probabilities, with the following results:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>0</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>1</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>2</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>3</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>4</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>5</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>6</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>7</sub>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4/17\n|}\n\nInformation entropy and complexity can then be calculated from the state probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Eta = - \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2 p_i = 2.86 \\text{ bits},</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2^2 p_i - \\Eta^2} = 0.56 \\text{ bits}.</math>\n\nNote that the maximum possible entropy for eight states is <math>\\log_2 8 = 3 \\text{ bits},</math> which would be the case if all eight states were equally likely with probabilities of 1/8 (randomness). Thus rule 110 has a relatively high entropy or state utilization at 2.86 bits. But this does not preclude a substantial fluctuation of state information about entropy and thus a substantial value of complexity. Whereas, maximum entropy ''would'' preclude complexity.\n\nAn alternative method can be used to obtain the state probabilities when the analytical method used above is unfeasible. Simply drive the system at its inputs (the driver cells) with a random source for many generations and observe the state probabilities empirically. When this is done via computer simulation for 10 million generations the results are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340284677_Measuring_complexity_using_information_fluctuation_a_tutorial|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation: a tutorial|last=Bates|first=John E.|date=2020-03-30|website=Research Gate|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Information variables for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |number of cells\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |6\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |7\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |8\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |9\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |10\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |11\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |12\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |13\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\Eta \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2.86\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5.66\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |6.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |7.47\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |8.34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |9.25\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.97\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |11.78\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.65\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.72\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.79\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.89\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.90\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.00\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.01\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.15\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I / \\Eta</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.20\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.15\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.13\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.12\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n|}\n\nSince both <math>\\Eta</math> and <math>\\sigma_I</math> increase with system size, their dimensionless ratio <math>\\sigma_I/\\Eta</math>, the ''relative information complexity'', is included to better compare systems of different sizes.

It is derivable from fluctuations in the predominance of order and chaos in a dynamic system and has been used as a measure of complexity in many diverse fields. It was introduced in a 1993 paper by Bates and Shepard.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John E.|last2=Shepard|first2=Harvey K.|date=1993-01-18|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019390232O|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=172|issue=6|pages=416\u2013425|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(93)90232-O|issn=0375-9601}}</ref>.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe information complexity of a discrete dynamic system is a function of the [[probability distribution]] of its states when it is subject to random external input data. The purpose of driving the system with a rich information source such as a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] or a [[White noise|white noise signal]] is to probe the internal dynamics of the system much the same as a [[impulse response|frequency-rich impulse]] is used in [[signal processing]]. \n\nIf a system has <math display=\"inline\">N</math> possible states and the ''state probabilities'' <math display=\"inline\">p_i</math>are known, then its [[Entropy (information theory)#Definition|information entropy]] is\n\n: <math>\\Eta = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i I_i = - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">I_i = -\\log p_i</math> is the [[information content]] of state <math display=\"inline\">i</math>.\n\nThe '''information complexity''' of the system is defined as the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] or fluctuation of <math display=\"inline\">I</math> about its mean <math display=\"inline\">\\Eta</math>:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(I_i - \\Eta)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_iI_i^2 - \\Eta^2}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log^2 p_i - \\Biggl(\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i \\Biggr)^2}.</math>\n\nThe ''fluctuation of state information'' <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is zero in a maximally disordered system with all <math>p_i = 1/N</math>; the system simply mimics its random inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is also zero when the system is perfectly ordered with just one fixed state <math>(p_1 = 1)</math>, regardless of inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is non-zero between these two extremes with a mixture of both higher-probability states and lower-probability states populating [[state space]].\n\n== Fluctuation of information allows for memory and computation ==\n\nAs a complex dynamic system evolves in time, how it transitions between states depends on external stimuli in an irregular way. At times it may be more sensitive to external stimuli (unstable) and at other times less sensitive (stable). If a particular state has several possible next-states, external information determines which one will be next and the system gains that information by following a particular trajectory in state space. But if several different states all lead to the same next-state, then upon entering the next-state the system loses information about which state preceded it. Thus, a complex system exhibits alternating information gain and loss as it evolves in time. The alternation or fluctuation of information is equivalent to remembering and forgetting \u2014 temporary information storage or memory \u2014 an essential feature of non-trivial computation. \n\nThe gain or loss of information associated with transitions between states can be related to state information. The ''net information gain'' of a transition from state <math>i</math> to state <math>j</math> is the information gained when leaving state <math>i</math> less the information lost when entering state <math>j</math>:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log p_{i \\rightarrow j} + \\log p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nHere <math display=\"inline\">p_{i \\rightarrow j}</math> is the ''forward conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>i</math> then the next state is <math>j</math> and <math>p_{i \\leftarrow j}</math> is the ''reverse conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>j</math> then the previous state was <math>i\n</math>. The conditional probabilities are related to the ''transition probability'' <math>p_{ij}</math>, the probability that a transition from state <math>i\n</math> to state <math>j</math> occurs, by:\n\n: <math>p_{ij} = p_i p_{i \\rightarrow j} = p_j p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nEliminating the conditional probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log (p_{ij}/p_i) + \\log (p_{ij}/p_j) = \\log p_i - \\log p_j = I_j - I_i.</math>\n\nTherefore the net information gained by the system as a result of the transition depends only on the increase in state information from the initial to the final state. It can be shown that this is true even for multiple consecutive transitions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<math>\\Gamma = \\Delta I</math> is reminiscent of the relation between force and [[Potential energy#Derivable from a potential|potential energy]]. <math>I</math> is like potential <math>\\Phi</math> and <math>\\Gamma</math> is like force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> in [[Potential energy#Derivable_from_a_potential|<math>\\mathbf{F}={\\nabla \\Phi}</math>]]. External information \u201cpushes\u201d a system \u201cuphill\u201d to a state of higher information potential to accomplish memory storage, much like pushing a mass uphill to a state of higher gravitational potential stores energy. The amount of energy storage depends only on the final height, not the path up the hill. Likewise, the amount of information storage does not depend on the transition path between two states in state space. Once a system reaches a rare state with high information potential, it may \"fall\" to a more common state, losing the previously stored information.\n\nIt may be useful to compute the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] of <math>\\Gamma</math> about its mean (which is zero), namely the ''fluctuation of net information gain'' <math>\\sigma_\\Gamma</math><ref name=\":0\" />, but <math>\\sigma_I</math> takes into account multi-transition ''memory loops'' in state space and therefore should be a better indicator of the computational power of a system. Moreover, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is easier to calculate because there can be many more transitions than states.  \n\n== Chaos and order ==\nA dynamic system that is sensitive to external information (unstable) exhibits [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior whereas one that is insensitive to external information (stable) exhibits orderly behavior. A complex system exhibits both behaviors, fluctuating between them in dynamic balance when subject to a rich information source. The degree of fluctuation is quantified by <math>\\sigma_I</math>; it captures the alternation in the predominance of chaos and order in a complex system as it evolves in time.\n\n== Example: rule 110 variant of the elementary cellular automaton ==\nThe [[rule 110]]  variant of the [[elementary cellular automaton]] has been [[Rule 110#The proof of universality|proven]] to be capable of [[universal computation]]. The proof is based on the existence and interactions of cohesive and self-perpetuating cell patterns known as gliders or [[Rule 110#Spaceships in Rule 110|spaceships]], [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent]] phenomena, that imply the capability of groups of automaton cells to remember that a glider is passing through them. It is therefore to be expected that there will be memory loops in state space resulting from alternations of information gain and loss, instability and stability, chaos and order.\n\nConsider a 3-cell group of adjacent automaton cells that obey rule 110: <math>\\text{end-center-end}</math>. The next state of the center cell depends on the present state of itself and the end cells as specified by the rule:   \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Elementary cellular automaton rule 110.\n!3-cell group\n|1-1-1\n|1-1-0\n|1-0-1\n|1-0-0\n|0-1-1\n|0-1-0\n|0-0-1\n|0-0-0\n|-\n!next center cell\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|}\n\nTo calculate the information complexity of this system, attach a ''driver cell'' to each end of the 3-cell group to provide a random external stimulus like so, <math>\\text{driver} \\rightarrow \\text{end-center-end} \\leftarrow \\text{driver}</math>, such that the rule can be applied to the two end cells. Next determine what the next state is for each possible present state and for each possible combination of driver cell contents, to determine the forward conditional probabilities. \n\nThe [[state diagram]] of this system is depicted below, with circles representing the states and arrows representing transitions between states. The eight states of this system, <math>1-1-1</math> to <math>0-0-0</math> are labeled with the decimal equivalent of the 3-bit contents of the 3-cell group: 7 to 0. The transition arrows are labeled with forward conditional probabilities. Notice that there is variability in the divergence and convergence of arrows corresponding to a variability in chaos and order, sensitivity and insensitivity, gain and loss of external information from the driver cells. \n[[File:State_diagram_for_rule_110_with_transition_probabilities.jpg|alt=|border|none|frame|'''The 3-cell state diagram for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton showing forward conditional transition probabilities with random stimulation.''']]\n\nThe forward conditional probabilities are determined by the ratio of possible driver cell contents that drive a particular transition. For example, for the four possible combinations of two driver cell contents, state 7 leads to states 5, 4, 1 and 0 so <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 5}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 4}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 1}</math>, and <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 0}</math> are each 1/4 or 25%. Likewise, state 0 leads to states 0, 1, 0 and 1 so <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 1}</math>and <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 0}</math>are each 1/2 or 50%. And so forth.\n\nThe state probabilities are related by\n\n: <math>p_j = \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i  p_{i \\rightarrow j} \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i = 1.</math>\n\nThese linear algebraic equations can be solved manually or with the aid of a computer program for the state probabilities, with the following results:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>0</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>1</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>2</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>3</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>4</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>5</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>6</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>7</sub>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4/17\n|}\n\nInformation entropy and complexity can then be calculated from the state probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Eta = - \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2 p_i = 2.86 \\text{ bits},</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2^2 p_i - \\Eta^2} = 0.56 \\text{ bits}.</math>\n\nNote that the maximum possible entropy for eight states is <math>\\log_2 8 = 3 \\text{ bits},</math> which would be the case if all eight states were equally likely with probabilities of 1/8 (randomness). Thus rule 110 has a relatively high entropy or state utilization at 2.86 bits. But this does not preclude a substantial fluctuation of state information about entropy and thus a substantial value of complexity. Whereas, maximum entropy ''would'' preclude complexity.\n\nAn alternative method can be used to obtain the state probabilities when the analytical method used above is unfeasible. Simply drive the system at its inputs (the driver cells) with a random source for many generations and observe the state probabilities empirically. When this is done via computer simulation for 10 million generations the results are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340284677_Measuring_complexity_using_information_fluctuation_a_tutorial|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation: a tutorial|last=Bates|first=John E.|date=2020-03-30|website=Research Gate|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Information variables for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |number of cells\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |6\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |7\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |8\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |9\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |10\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |11\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |12\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |13\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\Eta \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2.86\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5.66\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |6.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |7.47\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |8.34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |9.25\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.97\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |11.78\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.65\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.72\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.79\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.89\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.90\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.00\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.01\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.15\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I / \\Eta</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.20\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.15\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.13\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.12\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n|}\n\nSince both <math>\\Eta</math> and <math>\\sigma_I</math> increase with system size, their dimensionless ratio <math>\\sigma_I/\\Eta</math>, the ''relative information complexity'', is included to better compare systems of different sizes. Notice that the empirical and analytical results agree for the 3-cell automaton.\n\nIn the paper by Bates and Shepard<ref name=\":0\" />, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is computed for all elementary cellular automaton rules and it was observed that the ones that exhibit slow-moving gliders and possibly stationary objects, as rule 110 does, are highly correlated with large values of ''<math>\\sigma_I</math>''. ''<math>\\sigma_I</math>'' can therefore be used as a filter to select candidate rules for universal computation, which is tedious to prove.\n\n== Applications ==\nAlthough the derivation of the information complexity formula is based on information fluctuations in a dynamic system, it is given only in terms of state probabilities and so can be made to apply to any probability distribution, including those derived from static images or text.\n\nOver the years the original paper<ref name=\":0\" /> has been [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=18239232465073627536&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en referred] to by researchers in many diverse fields: ecology<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parrott|first=Lael|date=2010-11-01|title=Measuring ecological complexity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X10000567|journal=Ecological Indicators|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=1069\u20131076|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.03.014|issn=1470-160X}}</ref>, ecosystem sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chaojun|last2=Zhao|first2=Hongrui|date=2019-04-18|title=Analysis of remote sensing time-series data to foster ecosystem sustainability: use of temporal information entropy|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.1533661|journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing|volume=40|issue=8|pages=2880\u20132894|doi=10.1080/01431161.2018.1533661|issn=0143-1161}}</ref>, landscape sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zurlini|first=Giovanni|last2=Petrosillo|first2=Irene|last3=Jones|first3=K.

The band consists of guitarists and vocalists [[Ian MacKaye]] and [[Guy Picciotto]], bassist [[Joe Lally]], and drummer [[Brendan Canty]].\n\nFugazi are noted for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice, and contempt for the music industry.<ref name=\"Perlah, Jeff 2002\"/>\n\nFugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours and produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.<ref name=\"guitarworld\"/> Fugazi has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1986\u20131989)===\nAfter the [[hardcore punk]] group [[Minor Threat]] dissolved, Ian MacKaye (vocals and [[guitar]]) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. MacKaye decided he wanted a project that was \"like [[The Stooges]] with [[reggae]]\", but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's break up. MacKaye recalled, \"My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 384.</ref>\n\nMacKaye recruited ex-[[Dag Nasty]] [[drummer]] [[Colin Sears]] and [[bass guitar]]ist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of [[Rites of Spring]]). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate [[Guy Picciotto]] dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.<ref>Azerrad, p. 385.</ref>\n\nAfter some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word \"fugazi\" from Mark Baker's ''Nam'', a compilation of stories of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, it there being a slang acronym for \"Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [into a body bag]\".<ref>Baker, p. 321.</ref>\n\nThe band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a [[Hype man|foil]] in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band [[Happy Go Licky]] broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, which he accepted.<ref>Azerrad, p. 386.</ref>\n\n===''Fugazi EP'' & ''Margin Walker''&nbsp;\u2013 ''13 Songs'' (1988\u20131989)===\nFugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP ''[[Fugazi (EP)|Fugazi]]'' with producer [[Ted Niceley]] and producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] (who would become a long-time collaborator), and shortly afterwards embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.<ref>Azerrad, p. 396.</ref>\n\nAt the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. However, the band was spent from touring and decided that the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as ''[[Margin Walker]]'' the following year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the ''[[13 Songs (Fugazi album)|13 Songs]]'' release in late 1989.<ref name=\"stillinrock.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/03/anachronique-fugazi-war-punk.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Anachronique : Fugazi (War Punk) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref><ref>Azerrad, p. 398.</ref> Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 399\">Azerrad, p. 399.</ref>\n\n===''Repeater'' and ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' (1990\u20131992)===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Fugazi_-_Repeater.ogg\n|title=\"Repeater\"\n|description=Sample of \"Repeater\", from ''Repeater'' (1990)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nWith Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into [[Jam session|jamming]] and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as \"Merchandise\" and \"Turnover\", for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.<ref name=\"Perlah, Jeff 2002\">^ a b c d Perlah, Jeff. \"The Independent\". Guitar World. March 2002.</ref>\n\nReleased on April 19, 1990, through [[Dischord Records]], ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' did not initially reach the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind ''Repeater'', performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided to stay with  [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] and  refused the offers of those labels. ''Repeater'' ultimately went on to sell more than 1 million copies in the U.S. alone, and more than 2 million worldwide. The album was critically well received and featured an [[alternative rock]] sound that pre-dated significant releases such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' and [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream.<ref name=\"Perlah, Jeff 2002\"/>\n\nFor Fugazi's second studio-album ''[[Steady Diet of Nothing]]'', released in July 1991, the band once again asked [[Ted Niceley]] to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves.<ref>Azerrad, p. 407.</ref> After the success of ''Repeater'' and its subsequent world tour, ''Steady Diet'' was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.<ref>*{{cite book |last1=Andersen |first1=Mark |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |year=2001 |title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital |location=New York |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=1-888451-44-0}} p. 304</ref>\n\n===''In On the Kill Taker'' and ''Red Medicine'' (1993\u20131996)===\nFugazi recorded its third album ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]'' in the fall of 1992 with [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago; however, the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band re-recorded the album with [[Ted Niceley]] and [[Don Zientara]]. With the breakthrough of [[alternative rock]] in the early 1990s, ''In on the Kill Taker''; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album charts, received critical praise from ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'', ''[[TIME magazine]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" />\n\nBy the ''In on the Kill Taker'' tour, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the band's sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's [[Roseland Ballroom]] in September 1993, music mogul and [[Atlantic Records]] president [[Ahmet Ertegun]] met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegun offered the band \"anything you want\", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer.<ref>Freidman, p. 52.</ref> The organizers of [[Lollapalooza]] also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.<ref>{{harvnb|Norman|1993}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Fugazi_-_Combination_Lock.ogg\n|title=\"Combination Lock\"\n|description=Sample of \"Combination Lock\", from ''Red Medicine'' (1995)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nFugazi began writing the material for ''[[Red Medicine]]'' in late 1994, after touring in support of ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]''. The band worked with engineer [[Don Zientara]], but did not choose to work with producer [[Ted Niceley]] again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of ''In on the Kill Taker'' and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. ''Red Medicine'' would take Fugazi a step further toward [[art rock]]. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/227877/review/5945748\n|title=Red Medicine : Fugazi : Review : Rolling Stone\n|publisher=Rollingstone.com\n|accessdate=2009-03-03\n|last=\n|first=\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ian McKaye of Fugazi.jpg|thumb|right|McKaye performing with Fugazi at the Academy 1 in Manchester England on 30 October 2002]]\n\n===''End Hits'' and ''The Argument'' (1997\u20132002)===\nAfter the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of ''Red Medicine'', Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] to begin recording what would become the ''[[End Hits]]'' album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album.

It\u2019ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we\u2019d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we\u2019ll just see.\"<ref name=\"Interview: Joe Lally\"/>\n\nIn August 2014, Dischord announced an official release for ''[[First Demo]]'', an album featuring 11 demo songs recorded in January 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/news/580/2014/8/fugazi-first-demo-out-this-winter|title=Fugazi \"First Demo\" Out November 18th|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> The announcement included a preview of the demo for the Fugazi track \"Merchandise.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1714496/fugazi-merchandise-demo/mp3s/|title=Fugazi \u2013 \"Merchandise\" (Demo) - Stereogum|work=Stereogum|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> The eleven-track album was released on November 18, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/release/181/first-demo|title=Fugazi - First Demo|work=Dischord Records|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nMacKaye insisted in a 2017 interview that Fugazi is not, in fact, broken up. While he admits any future public performance will have to contend with various confounding factors, the members have occasionally played music together, privately, since their 2003 hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.culturecreature.com/fugazi-reunion/ |title=Fugazi's still around--they just went underground |publisher=culturecreature.com |date=2017-01-19 |accessdate=2017-10-09}}</ref> On March 21, 2018, in an interview on Vish Khanna's Kreative Kontrol podcast, Lally confirmed the band's irregular practice of casual get-togethers. He stated: \u201cYeah, when we\u2019re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we\u2019ll play some music together.\u201d Lally also stated that additional public performances or tours were unlikely: \"There\u2019s so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.\u201d\n\nOn February 13th, 2019, ''[[Louder Sound]]'' asked Lally and Canty about the possibility of Fugazi returning, Lally responded \u201cYou never want to say never about anything, because how can you say that about the future? But there does seem to be a lack of time to allow it to happen, because the four of us would have to spend a lot of time together to figure out, 'Should we play old songs?' 'Who are we now?' 'What is it now?' We are not the kind of band to get together and just rehearse two hours of old songs to go out and play it, rake in the dough and come home.\u201d Canty added, \"If we got back together it would have to be from the spirit of creativity. It would be different if we got back together.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-messthetics-are-the-band-every-fugazi-fan-needs-in-their-life |title=The Messthetics are the band every Fugazi fan needs in their life |publisher=Loudersound.com |date=2019-02-13 |accessdate=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==Side projects and related work==\nIn the hiatus, the members undertook side projects, with MacKaye forming the duo [[The Evens]] with drummer and singer [[Amy Farina]] (formerly of [[the Warmers]]).\n\nIn 2004, MacKaye produced the ''[[DC EP]]'' for former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]], which also featured Jerry Busher.\n\nCanty has been doing a variety of soundtrack scores and playing bass in the trio [[Garland Of Hours]] alongside frequent Fugazi guest contributors Jerry Busher and Amy Domingues, and has played bass live with [[Mary Timony]]. Canty also appears on [[Bob Mould]]'s 2005 album ''[[Body of Song]]'' and on Mould's 2008 album ''[[District Line (album)|District Line]]'', and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD ''Circle of Friends''. He is currently working in the [[Burn to Shine (DVD series)|Burn to Shine]] DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, The Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on [[Dischord Records]].\n\nLally has released three solo albums, ''[[There to Here]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Is Underrated]]'' (2007), and ''[[Why Should I Get Used To It]]'' (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers [[Decahedron]]'s debut album ''Disconnection_Imminent'', as well as on a project with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarists [[John Frusciante]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], known as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].  The group has recorded two albums, ''[[Automatic Writing]]'' (2004) and ''[[AW II]]'' (2007).\n\nPicciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]], and he has performed alongside members of [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] at the [[Jazz]] festival in [[Wels]], [[Austria]]. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two [[Vic Chesnutt]] albums, 2007's \"[[North Star Deserter]] and 2009's ''[[At the Cut]]'' (co-producing the latter), for [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation Records]] and performed live with Chesnutt and members of [[Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra]] and The Quavers in [[Jem Cohen]]'s program entitled, \"Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the [[Vienna International Film Festival]] (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009).  Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt's Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician [[Kathi Wilcox]] from the band [[Bikini Kill]] and [[The Frumpies]].\n\nIn July 2011, Minneapolis based record label [[Doomtree]] released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wugazis-13-chambers-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110713?asid=98b65563 |title=Wugazi's '13 Chambers': A Track-by-Track Breakdown |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 2011|author=Joe Gross |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated \"I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it.

Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via [[Dischord Records]]. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011 Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a \"[[pay what you want]]\" sliding scale option for each download between $1\u2013100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series|title=Fugazi Live Series: A to Z|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> For $500 fans can also purchase an \"All Access\" privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/arts/music/fugazi-live-series-a-post-punk-bands-archive-of-shows.html |title=Fugazi Rises Again, In Online Archive |publisher=New York Times |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]] explained to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"We liked this idea of, 'Let's just let it be everything,' ... There doesn't have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get.\" The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s, then eventually digital formats such as [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], [[CD-R]] and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]] and [[Pearl Jam]], three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.<ref name=\"New York Times\"/>\n\n==Musical style==\nFugazi's style has been described as [[post-hardcore]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fugazi-mn0000798606/biography |title=Fugazi &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> [[art punk]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/Fugazi_Nearly_Finished_Massive_Live_Archive_Project | title=Fugazi Nearly Finished Massive Live Archive Project | publisher=[[Exclaim!]] | date=July 19, 2010 | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | author=Carlick, Stephen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/27321/in-on-the-killjoy | title=In on the Killjoy | publisher=[[Washington City Paper]] | date=October 17, 2003 | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | author=Little, Michael}}</ref> [[alternative rock]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Farseth|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Farseth|date=2012|title=American Rock: Guitar Heroes, Punks, and Metalheads|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPilDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=%22fugazi%22+%22alternative+rock%22&source=bl&ots=jx253jHBTM&sig=jRRV8HItT637agmUOMthyW3tmkE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM7Imh1szRAhXMIsAKHTZsBlwQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&q=%22fugazi%22%20%22alternative%20rock%22&f=false|access-date=January 18, 2017|quote=Fugazi's mixture of [[punk rock|punk]] guitars and [[funk]]y rhythms made it one of the most influential bands in alternative rock.}}</ref> and [[experimental rock]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1133821/fugazi-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/redmedicine/ | title=Fugazi Albums From Worst To Best: Red Medicine | publisher=[[Stereogum]] | date=August 23, 2012 | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | author=Toth, James Jackson}}</ref> Fugazi's music was an intentional departure from that of the [[hardcore punk]] bands the members had played in previously. Fugazi combined punk with [[funk]] and [[reggae]] beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained.<ref>Azerrad, p. 391\u2013392.</ref>\n\nPicciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's [[dub music|dub]]-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to MacKaye; employing a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to \"cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 399\"/> Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them.<ref>Azerrad, p. 399\u2013400.</ref> When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /> ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No.&nbsp;86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.<ref name=\"Spin Magazine 100 Greatest Guitarists\">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/05/spins-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time/?page=1 |title=SPIN's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Spin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and [[anthem]]ic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able [[slogan]]s), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /> Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, [[soul music|soul]] and [[noise rock|noise]] with an inventively syncopated [[rhythm section]]. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of \"[[lead guitar|lead]]\" and \"[[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]\" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[chord progression|progressions]] filtered through a hardcore punk lens.\n\nWhen questioned by ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist [[Ian MacKaye]] responded, \"Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music.\"\n\n[[Joe Strummer]] (lead vocalist of [[The Clash]]) recognized Fugazi as the band who best exemplified punk's spirit in a 2000 Rolling Stone interview.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation\u2019s Capital|last1=Andersen|first1=Mark|last2=Jenkins|first2=Mark|date=2003|publisher=Akashic Books|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nEach of Fugazi's albums since ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' have featured an [[instrumental rock|instrumental]]. By the time of 1995's ''[[Red Medicine]]'' bassist [[Joe Lally]] also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an \"unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements\" such as \"clattering [[musique concr\u00e8te]] ... [[piano]] and [[sound effect]]s ... murky [[Dub music|dub]] and lancing [[clarinet]]\" and \"loose-limbed [[jam band|jammy]] [[funk]] ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers.\"<ref name=\"Fugazi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fugazi |title=Fugazi |publisher=TrouserPress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==Business practices==\nOn their first tours, Fugazi worked out its [[Do it yourself|DIY]] ethic by trial and error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of [[simple living]]: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to [[price gouging]] a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.<ref name=\"punklives\">Eric Brace. (August 1, 1993) [https://archive.today/20181005224001/http://www.oocities.org/drawcamp/wp93.htm PUNK LIVES! Washington's Fugazi Claims It's Just a Band. So Why Do So Many Kids Think It's God?] The Washington Post</ref> [[Everett True]] has said that MacKaye and Fugazi \"had a mind-set that believed that any involvement with the system was corrupting and that you should create completely alternative structures outside\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Danny |title=Serving the Servant: Remembering Kurt Cobain |date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn later years and at many venues, particularly on the east and west coasts of the U.S., Fugazi was unable to get ticket prices below about $10\u2013$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's keen sense of audience response in given regions. Many times the band performed sold-out shows multiple consecutive nights at the same venue.<ref name=\"punklives\" />\n\nFugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, \"You find the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]], you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 391.</ref>\n\nThe group (MacKaye in particular) also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted [[slam dancing]] and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s [[hardcore punk]] era. [[Michael Azerrad]] quotes Mackaye, \"See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it ''freaks'' them out \u2013 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?'\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 392\">Azerrad, p. 392.</ref> Azerrad writes, \"[MacKaye's] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey \u2013 it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 392\"/> Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).\n\nDuring the summer of 1990 MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd.<ref>[http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306133611/http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796 |date=March 6, 2010 }}</ref> in order to shield his own and his bandmates' personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As MacKaye's financial advisor, Seth Martin, explained to the ''Washington Post'' in a 1993 interview: \"protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be harder to go after their personal assets.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/drawcamp/wp93.htm&date=2009-10-25+21:05:41 |archivedate=October 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n\nFugazi's music has been immensely influential on a number of [[punk music|punk]] and [[alternative music|alternative]] bands throughout the years.

The band consists of guitarists and vocalists [[Ian MacKaye]] and [[Guy Picciotto]], bassist [[Joe Lally]], and drummer [[Brendan Canty]].\n\nFugazi are noted for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice, and contempt for the music industry.<ref name=\"Perlah, Jeff 2002\"/>\n\nFugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours and produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.<ref name=\"guitarworld\"/> Fugazi has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1986\u20131989)===\nAfter the [[hardcore punk]] group [[Minor Threat]] dissolved, Ian MacKaye (vocals and [[guitar]]) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. MacKaye decided he wanted a project that was \"like [[The Stooges]] with [[reggae]]\", but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's break up. MacKaye recalled, \"My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 384.</ref>\n\nMacKaye recruited ex-[[Dag Nasty]] [[drummer]] [[Colin Sears]] and [[bass guitar]]ist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of [[Rites of Spring]]). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate [[Guy Picciotto]] dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.<ref>Azerrad, p. 385.</ref>\n\nAfter some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word \"fugazi\" from Mark Baker's ''Nam'', a compilation of stories of [[Vietnam War]] veterans, it there being a slang acronym for \"Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [into a body bag]\".<ref>Baker, p. 321.</ref>\n\nThe band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a [[Hype man|foil]] in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band [[Happy Go Licky]] broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, which he accepted.<ref>Azerrad, p. 386.</ref>\n\n===''Fugazi EP'' & ''Margin Walker''&nbsp;\u2013 ''13 Songs'' (1988\u20131989)===\nFugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP ''[[Fugazi (EP)|Fugazi]]'' with producer [[Ted Niceley]] and producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] (who would become a long-time collaborator), and shortly afterwards embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.<ref>Azerrad, p. 396.</ref>\n\nAt the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. However, the band was spent from touring and decided that the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as ''[[Margin Walker]]'' the following year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the ''[[13 Songs (Fugazi album)|13 Songs]]'' release in late 1989.<ref name=\"stillinrock.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/03/anachronique-fugazi-war-punk.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Anachronique : Fugazi (War Punk) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref><ref>Azerrad, p. 398.</ref> Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 399\">Azerrad, p. 399.</ref>\n\n===''Repeater'' and ''Steady Diet of Nothing'' (1990\u20131992)===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Fugazi_-_Repeater.ogg\n|title=\"Repeater\"\n|description=Sample of \"Repeater\", from ''Repeater'' (1990)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nWith Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into [[Jam session|jamming]] and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as \"Merchandise\" and \"Turnover\", for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.<ref name=\"Perlah, Jeff 2002\">^ a b c d Perlah, Jeff. \"The Independent\". Guitar World. March 2002.</ref>\n\nReleased on April 19, 1990, through [[Dischord Records]], ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' did not initially reach the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind ''Repeater'', performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided to stay with  [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] and  refused the offers of those labels. ''Repeater'' ultimately went on to sell more than 1 million copies in the U.S. alone, and more than 2 million worldwide. The album was critically well received and featured an [[alternative rock]] sound that pre-dated significant releases such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' and [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream.<ref name=\"Perlah, Jeff 2002\"/>\n\nFor Fugazi's second studio-album ''[[Steady Diet of Nothing]]'', released in July 1991, the band once again asked [[Ted Niceley]] to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves.<ref>Azerrad, p. 407.</ref> After the success of ''Repeater'' and its subsequent world tour, ''Steady Diet'' was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.<ref>*{{cite book |last1=Andersen |first1=Mark |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |year=2001 |title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital |location=New York |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=1-888451-44-0}} p. 304</ref>\n\n===''In On the Kill Taker'' and ''Red Medicine'' (1993\u20131996)===\nFugazi recorded its third album ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]'' in the fall of 1992 with [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago; however, the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band re-recorded the album with [[Ted Niceley]] and [[Don Zientara]]. With the breakthrough of [[alternative rock]] in the early 1990s, ''In on the Kill Taker''; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album charts, received critical praise from ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'', ''[[TIME magazine]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" />\n\nBy the ''In on the Kill Taker'' tour, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the band's sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's [[Roseland Ballroom]] in September 1993, music mogul and [[Atlantic Records]] president [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]] met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Erteg\u00fcn offered the band \"anything you want\", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer.<ref>Freidman, p. 52.</ref> The organizers of [[Lollapalooza]] also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.<ref>{{harvnb|Norman|1993}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Fugazi_-_Combination_Lock.ogg\n|title=\"Combination Lock\"\n|description=Sample of \"Combination Lock\", from ''Red Medicine'' (1995)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nFugazi began writing the material for ''[[Red Medicine]]'' in late 1994, after touring in support of ''[[In on the Kill Taker]]''. The band worked with engineer [[Don Zientara]], but did not choose to work with producer [[Ted Niceley]] again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of ''In on the Kill Taker'' and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. ''Red Medicine'' would take Fugazi a step further toward [[art rock]]. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/227877/review/5945748\n|title=Red Medicine : Fugazi : Review : Rolling Stone\n|publisher=Rollingstone.com\n|accessdate=2009-03-03\n|last=\n|first=\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ian McKaye of Fugazi.jpg|thumb|right|McKaye performing with Fugazi at the Academy 1 in Manchester England on 30 October 2002]]\n\n===''End Hits'' and ''The Argument'' (1997\u20132002)===\nAfter the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of ''Red Medicine'', Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer [[Don Zientara]] to begin recording what would become the ''[[End Hits]]'' album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release.<ref name=\"Morphizm\">{{cite web | url=http://www.morphizm.com/recommends/fugaziguy.html| title=Guy Picciotto of Fugazi:The Argument (2001): Interview | work=Morphizm | publisher=Morphizm.com | accessdate=2009-03-19 }}</ref> Released on April 28, 1998 the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].

He stated: \u201cYeah, when we\u2019re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we\u2019ll play some music together.\u201d Lally also stated that additional public performances or tours were unlikely: \"There\u2019s so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.\u201d\n\nOn February 13th, 2019, ''[[Louder Sound]]'' asked Lally and Canty about the possibility of Fugazi returning, Lally responded \u201cYou never want to say never about anything, because how can you say that about the future?

'What is it now?' We are not the kind of band to get together and just rehearse two hours of old songs to go out and play it, rake in the dough and come home.\u201d Canty added, \"If we got back together it would have to be from the spirit of creativity.

Canty also appears on [[Bob Mould]]'s 2005 album ''[[Body of Song]]'' and on Mould's 2008 album ''[[District Line (album)|District Line]]'', and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD ''Circle of Friends''. He is currently working in the [[Burn to Shine (DVD series)|Burn to Shine]] DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, The Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on [[Dischord Records]].\n\nLally has released three solo albums, ''[[There to Here]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Is Underrated]]'' (2007), and ''[[Why Should I Get Used To It]]'' (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers [[Decahedron]]'s debut album ''Disconnection_Imminent'', as well as on a project with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarists [[John Frusciante]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], known as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].  The group has recorded two albums, ''[[Automatic Writing]]'' (2004) and ''[[AW II]]'' (2007).\n\nPicciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]], and he has performed alongside members of [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] at the [[Jazz]] festival in [[Wels]], [[Austria]]. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two [[Vic Chesnutt]] albums, 2007's \"[[North Star Deserter]] and 2009's ''[[At the Cut]]'' (co-producing the latter), for [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation Records]] and performed live with Chesnutt and members of [[Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra]] and The Quavers in [[Jem Cohen]]'s program entitled, \"Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the [[Vienna International Film Festival]] (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009).  Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt's Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician [[Kathi Wilcox]] from the band [[Bikini Kill]] and [[The Frumpies]].\n\nIn July 2011, Minneapolis based record label [[Doomtree]] released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wugazis-13-chambers-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110713?asid=98b65563 |title=Wugazi's '13 Chambers': A Track-by-Track Breakdown |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 2011|author=Joe Gross |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref> Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated \"I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it.

Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via [[Dischord Records]]. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011 Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a \"[[pay what you want]]\" sliding scale option for each download between $1\u2013100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series|title=Fugazi Live Series: A to Z|publisher=Dischord.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> For $500 fans can also purchase an \"All Access\" privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/arts/music/fugazi-live-series-a-post-punk-bands-archive-of-shows.html |title=Fugazi Rises Again, In Online Archive |publisher=New York Times |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]] explained to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"We liked this idea of, 'Let's just let it be everything,' ... There doesn't have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get.\" The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s, then eventually digital formats such as [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], [[CD-R]] and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Phish]] and [[Pearl Jam]], three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.<ref name=\"New York Times\"/>\n\n==Musical style==\nFugazi's style has been described as [[post-hardcore]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fugazi-mn0000798606/biography |title=Fugazi &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> [[art punk]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/Fugazi_Nearly_Finished_Massive_Live_Archive_Project | title=Fugazi Nearly Finished Massive Live Archive Project | publisher=[[Exclaim!]] | date=July 19, 2010 | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | author=Carlick, Stephen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/27321/in-on-the-killjoy | title=In on the Killjoy | publisher=[[Washington City Paper]] | date=October 17, 2003 | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | author=Little, Michael}}</ref> [[alternative rock]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Farseth|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Farseth|date=2012|title=American Rock: Guitar Heroes, Punks, and Metalheads|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPilDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=%22fugazi%22+%22alternative+rock%22&source=bl&ots=jx253jHBTM&sig=jRRV8HItT637agmUOMthyW3tmkE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM7Imh1szRAhXMIsAKHTZsBlwQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&q=%22fugazi%22%20%22alternative%20rock%22&f=false|access-date=January 18, 2017|quote=Fugazi's mixture of [[punk rock|punk]] guitars and [[funk]]y rhythms made it one of the most influential bands in alternative rock.}}</ref> and [[experimental rock]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1133821/fugazi-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/redmedicine/ | title=Fugazi Albums From Worst To Best: Red Medicine | publisher=[[Stereogum]] | date=August 23, 2012 | accessdate=April 17, 2015 | author=Toth, James Jackson}}</ref> Fugazi's music was an intentional departure from that of the [[hardcore punk]] bands the members had played in previously. Fugazi combined punk with [[funk]] and [[reggae]] beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained.<ref>Azerrad, p. 391\u2013392.</ref>\n\nPicciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's [[dub music|dub]]-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to MacKaye; employing a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to \"cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 399\"/> Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them.<ref>Azerrad, p. 399\u2013400.</ref> When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /> ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No.&nbsp;86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.<ref name=\"Spin Magazine 100 Greatest Guitarists\">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/05/spins-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time/?page=1 |title=SPIN's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Spin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and [[anthem]]ic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able [[slogan]]s), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach.<ref name=\"guitarworld\" /> Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, [[soul music|soul]] and [[noise rock|noise]] with an inventively syncopated [[rhythm section]]. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of \"[[lead guitar|lead]]\" and \"[[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]\" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[chord progression|progressions]] filtered through a hardcore punk lens.\n\nWhen questioned by ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist [[Ian MacKaye]] responded, \"Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music.\"\n\n[[Joe Strummer]] (lead vocalist of [[The Clash]]) recognized Fugazi as the band who best exemplified punk's spirit in a 2000 Rolling Stone interview.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation\u2019s Capital|last1=Andersen|first1=Mark|last2=Jenkins|first2=Mark|date=2003|publisher=Akashic Books|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nEach of Fugazi's albums since ''[[Repeater (album)|Repeater]]'' have featured an [[instrumental rock|instrumental]]. By the time of 1995's ''[[Red Medicine]]'' bassist [[Joe Lally]] also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an \"unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements\" such as \"clattering [[musique concr\u00e8te]] ... [[piano]] and [[sound effect]]s ... murky [[Dub music|dub]] and lancing [[clarinet]]\" and \"loose-limbed [[jam band|jammy]] [[funk]] ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers.\"<ref name=\"Fugazi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fugazi |title=Fugazi |publisher=TrouserPress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==Business practices==\nOn their first tours, Fugazi worked out its [[Do it yourself|DIY]] ethic by trial and error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of [[simple living]]: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to [[price gouging]] a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.<ref name=\"punklives\">Eric Brace. (August 1, 1993) [https://archive.today/20181005224001/http://www.oocities.org/drawcamp/wp93.htm PUNK LIVES! Washington's Fugazi Claims It's Just a Band. So Why Do So Many Kids Think It's God?] The Washington Post</ref> [[Everett True]] has said that MacKaye and Fugazi \"had a mind-set that believed that any involvement with the system was corrupting and that you should create completely alternative structures outside\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Danny |title=Serving the Servant: Remembering Kurt Cobain |date=2019}}</ref>\n\nIn later years and at many venues, particularly on the east and west coasts of the U.S., Fugazi was unable to get ticket prices below about $10\u2013$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's keen sense of audience response in given regions. Many times the band performed sold-out shows multiple consecutive nights at the same venue.<ref name=\"punklives\" />\n\nFugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, \"You find the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]], you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 391.</ref>\n\nThe group (MacKaye in particular) also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted [[slam dancing]] and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s [[hardcore punk]] era. [[Michael Azerrad]] quotes Mackaye, \"See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it ''freaks'' them out \u2013 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?'\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 392\">Azerrad, p. 392.</ref> Azerrad writes, \"[MacKaye's] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey \u2013 it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, p. 392\"/> Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).\n\nDuring the summer of 1990 MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd.<ref>[http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306133611/http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=165796 |date=March 6, 2010 }}</ref> in order to shield his own and his bandmates' personal assets from the threat of lawsuits.
