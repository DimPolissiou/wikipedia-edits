Herbie was owned by an egotistic racing driver and car dealer named Simon Moore III ([[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]]). Due to his arrogance, he did not treat Herbie very well. During a race, Simon Moore III called Herbie junk, which caused Herbie to rebel against his owner. They ended up in last place for the race. Simon was not pleased and he threw out Herbie in a junkyard.\n\nHank Cooper ([[ Bruce Campbell]]), a small-town mechanic who works in a local garage, enters a junk-car race where drivers select a jalopy and attempt to start and race it.  Hank ends up getting \"last choice\" and is forced to choose the only car left, a broken-down Herbie.  Assisted by his \"spiritually enlightened\" but goofy friend Roddy, Hank manages to get Herbie started just before he is towed off the track.  In appreciation for his kindness to the little VW, Herbie manages to win the race, trouncing such junkers as a Cadillac limousine and an early-model Corvair Monza convertible. The judges of the race, Donny Shotz ([[Micky Dolenz]]), Alex ([[Alexandra Wentworth]]), whom Hank used to date; and Simon, find it hard to believe that such a tiny car could run so fast, and Alex challenges Hank to prove that he didn't try any tricks during the race in order to win.  Hank takes Alex for a ride, showing Herbie's speed, and their relationship is re-kindled (with Herbie driving them to an isolated area and locking his doors, as he did with Jim Douglas and Carol Bennett in the first movie).  Meanwhile, Roddy tells Hank that Herbie is special, and takes him to an automotive art show.  At the show, Simon sees Herbie and attempts to discover why his car, which failed him, took Hank to victory.  He discovers that Herbie was built by Dr. Gustav Stumpfel ([[Harold Gould]]) shortly after World War II. He asked Dr. Gustav to create another car, but he wants the car to be pure evil and black. He ends up naming the second car \"Horace the Hate Bug,\" using the \"magical ingredients\" of a picture of Simon, along with Herbie's key.\n\nSimon orders Horace to find Herbie and destroy him, which Horace does, leaving Herbie a heap of crushed metal.  Hank catches up with Herbie, but finds it's too late to save him, and Hank, Roddy, and Alex give Herbie a funeral.  At the funeral, Herbie's former owner Jim Douglas arrives, and after examining Herbie's remains, informs them that he can be rebuilt, provided they use all of Herbie's original sheet metal.  Hank gets Donny Shotz, an auto customizer, to re-shape and paint Herbie's sheet metal.  Hank, Roddy, Alex, and Jim work to rebuild Herbie, and when finished, Hank gives Jim the honor of trying to start him.  Herbie starts on the first try, and sounds his horn, letting them know that he's the same car that they have come to know and love.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon challenges Hank to a race between Horace and Herbie. Although Simon makes every attempt to sabotage the race, Herbie manages to win (cut in half by Horace's laser). Furious, Horace tries to destroy Herbie again by ramming him off a cliff, but ends up falling into the ravine himself.  Simon and his partner Rupert are then arrested for illegally detonating explosives, driving an unregistered \"devil car,\" and illegally dumping said car.\n\nThe film ends with Hank and Alex, in love again, driving off in Herbie after finishing up on a magazine article about Herbie.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as Hank Cooper\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as Simon Moore III\n* [[Ali Wentworth|Alexandra Wentworth]] as Alex Davis\n* [[Kevin J.

Maclean]\n1941 S.C. 613 from Documents of the Lord Lyon, from Heraldica.org</ref> Since this decree, there has been much confusion as to the Chiefship of the Clan Fraser.\n\nWhen Simon the Pater's descendants first acquired the Lovat lands of the Ard, in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], they took to the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] customs of the area. This included everything from [[Scottish Gaelic language|language]], ways of [[Gaelic warfare|warfare]], to [[Gaelic Clothing and Fashion|clothing and fashion]], even giving their children Gaelic names. By the time Simon's son came of age to lead the family, he was deemed to be the 1st Chief of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh.<ref name=FraserCal>[http://www.fraserclan-cal.net/philorth.html \"The Frasers of Philorth, Now Saltoun\"] from the Clan Fraser Association for California</ref>\n\nFrasers who stayed in the [[Scottish lowlands|Lowlands]], however, maintained [[Teutons|Teutonic]] ([[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]), or Norman culture. They became a very respectable and well-to-do family, but stayed well out of Clan affairs. They took no part in Clan warfare, spoke [[Scots Language|Scots]], and dressed like Lowlanders.<ref name=FraserCal/>\n\nAccording to [[Alexander Fraser, 18th Lord Saltoun|Alexander Fraser]], 18th [[Lord Saltoun]], his family ''\"continued to have their principal seat in the Lowlands, and those of the surname who remained in that section of Scotland, where Teutonic institutions prevailed, and whence the patriarchal system of Clans and Clanships had long been banished, had nothing to do with the origin or formation of the Highland Clan, and never belonged to it.\"''<ref name=FraserCal/>\n\nAccording to the [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|Lady Saltoun]], his descendant,\n''\"The [[Frasers of Philorth]], [[Lord Saltoun|the Lords Saltoun]], being the senior line, are Chiefs of the name of Fraser, although a [[Scottish lowlands|lowland]] family. [[Simon Fraser, 18th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] is [[Clan chief|Chief]] of the very numerous [[Scottish highlands|Highland]] Clan Fraser of Lovat, based in [[Inverness-shire]].\"'' <ref name=fraserchief>[http://www.fraserchief.co.uk/twochiefs.html Two Chiefs] from FraserChief, the website of the Lady Saltoun</ref>\n\nThe Lady Saltoun is not a descendant of the Shimidh, the Simon from whom the Clan Fraser traces its lineage. As explained elsewhere, she is descended from the Shimidh's older brother. So, though the Lord Lovat is still the Chieftain of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh, the Lord Lyon has made official the seniority of the Lady Saltoun's line.\n\nThe selection of a clan chieftain is traditionally very different than the Teutonic/Norman system of inherited titles. A Clan would elect and follow whatever chief it chose. Unfortunately, from a history student's perspective, in the case of the Clan Fraser, this decree has muddied the waters a bit, regarding both what the Clan truly is and has been.<ref name=FraserCal/> Frasers differ on the matter, but most Lovats still regard the Lord Lovat as their chief, while many lowland Frasers, who have latched on to the romanticised view of Clans and the Highlands, are happy to have found a way to link themselves to Highland culture. There is, of course, some cross-over of opinions, and Frasers tend to respect each other as fellow Frasers, regardless of where they come from.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Scottish clan chief]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=lower-alpha |refs=\n\n<ref name=Archibald-1815>Archibald Campbell Fraser died in 1815, aged 79.

This included everything from [[Scottish Gaelic language|language]], ways of [[Gaelic warfare|warfare]], to [[Gaelic Clothing and Fashion|clothing and fashion]], even giving their children Gaelic names.

They became a very respectable and well-to-do family, but stayed well out of Clan affairs.

As explained elsewhere, she is descended from the Shimidh's older brother. So, though the Lord Lovat is still the Chieftain of Clan Fraser, the MacShimidh, the Lord Lyon has made official the seniority of the Lady Saltoun's line.\n\nThe selection of a clan chieftain is traditionally very different than the Teutonic/Norman system of inherited titles. A Clan would elect and follow whatever chief it chose. Unfortunately, from a history student's perspective, in the case of the Clan Fraser, this decree has muddied the waters a bit, regarding both what the Clan truly is and has been.<ref name=FraserCal/> Frasers differ on the matter, but most Lovats still regard the Lord Lovat as their chief, while many lowland Frasers, who have latched on to the romanticised view of Clans and the Highlands, are happy to have found a way to link themselves to Highland culture. There is, of course, some cross-over of opinions, and Frasers tend to respect each other as fellow Frasers, regardless of where they come from.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Scottish clan chief]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=lower-alpha |refs=\n\n<ref name=Archibald-1815>Archibald Campbell Fraser died in 1815, aged 79.

Serving as the [[eponym]]ous [[protagonist]] of the series, he is a young [[ninja]] from the fictional village of Konohagakure. The villagers ridicule Naruto on account of the [[Nine-Tailed Demon Fox]]\u2014a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure\u2014that was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and [[original video animation]]s (OVA), as well as the sequel ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'', where his son, [[Boruto Uzumaki]], is the protagonist.\n\nWhen creating Naruto for the [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|initial part]] of the series, Kishimoto kept the character \"simple and stupid\", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with different clothes intended to appeal to Western audiences and to make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II)|Part II]] of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by [[Junko Takeuchi]] in the original animated series and [[Maile Flanagan]] in the English adaptations.\n\nMerchandise based on Naruto includes [[Action figure|figurines]] and [[keychain]]s. Naruto's character development has been praised by anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other ''sh\u014dnen'' manga, others have praised his personality and character development as he avoids stereotypes typically seen in similar media.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n===Original concept and influences===\n[[File:NarutoUzumakiKishimoto.jpg|alt=Naruto Uzumaki in his regular orange jumpsuit doing a handsign|thumb|upright|Original sketch for Naruto in Kishimoto's one-shot, ''Naruto'' (1997), which went through several alterations for the manga series due to its amount of detail|left]]\nDuring the 1990s, new manga author [[Masashi Kishimoto]] sought to write a one-shot chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print.

Kishimoto reflects Naruto's \"honest\" smile was well received in contrast to the sly look the main character from ''Karakuri'' had. Following the success of another one-shot, ''Mario'', Kishimoto started working on the ''Naruto'' series where he wanted to reuse the title character from his earlier one-shot. Kishimoto's editor, Kosuke Yahagi, told him to write two chapters heavily focused on Naruto Uzumaki in order to show his appeal to the readers and then focus on the other protagonists. Both Yahagi and Kishimoto noted the manga's second chapter was the most difficult to write early in the series as it was meant to work on Naruto's traits and how they impact on the character [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]]. Following the second chapter, Yahagi advised Kishimoto to introduce the misrelationships Naruto had with the main cast, including his rivalry with [[Sasuke Uchiha]] and his failure at trying to attract his love interest [[Sakura Haruno]]. Although Yahagi was not Kishimoto's editor for the entire serialization, he knew how the story was planned to show Naruto's coming-of-age through multiple fights and looked forward to seeing the conclusion.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Jump Square]]|title=Naruto: The Beginning|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|issue=12\u201314|date=December 2014|author=}}</ref>\n\nFor the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by [[Goku]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise.

This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world.

However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to finally be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers due to the fact both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan letters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened as a result of their fight but still expected from the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal.<ref name=\"kizuna\"/> Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of [[yin and yang]] because of their notable differences.

Director Hiroyuki Yamashita elected himself in charge of the battle which left most of the anime members relieved due to his experience. For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from the [[CyberConnect2]] develop who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight to look realistic, giving Sasuke scary look as well the hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact. The staff noted that following this fight, Sasuke's face became calmer despite his initial look, giving room to explore his redemption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pierrot2.com/naruto/2016/10/03/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%90%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%8F%E8%A9%B1/|title=\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u88cf\u8a71|publisher=Pierrot|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the student-teacher relationships Kishimoto has created in the ''Naruto'' series, the bond between Naruto and [[Jiraiya (Naruto)|Jiraiya]] is his favorite, noting that it makes drawing them \"worthwhile.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |isbn=1421514079 |page=143|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto}}</ref> Regarding bonds in the story, Kishimoto remarks to Jiraiya's death in his fight against Pain for in his last moments, he discovers the origin of Pain's multiple bodies and uses his last forces to send that message as a piece of advice to Naruto so that Naruto could defeat him in his place.<ref name=\"kizuna\"/> According to Kishimoto, this arc was the most difficult one to write; he felt this because Naruto, truly forgave his enemy.

The principal reason for this was a significant difference between the two main characters, Naruto who had no knowledge of wars, and Sasuke who was a victim of one; his entire clan had been annihilated to avoid a potential civil war. As a result, Kishimoto created Nagato as a war victim who would Jiraiya, and act as Naruto's nemesis so he would understand the tragedy that Sasuke had experienced.<ref name=\"Koba\"/> As a result, Naruto's coming-of-age would have been completed in this arc and the final arc where Naruto deals with world war and develops a vision of the shinobi world as well as how he should handle the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2014/12/04/27837.html|title=\u3010\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff0f\u524d\u7de8\u3011\u300cNARUTO-\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8-\u300d\u539f\u4f5c\u8005\u30fb\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u5fcd\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3|publisher=Cinema Cafe|language=Japanese|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the original Japanese versions of ''Naruto'', Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum \"''-ttebayo''\" (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with \"you know?\" in English).

He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more he puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children growing up in the real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for [[acceptance]], and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful [[shinobi]], and a \"complete and mature person.\" Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development is similar to that of a modern American [[hero]], the type who accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Lawrence C. |title=Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions|chapter=Big Heroes on the Small Screen: Naruto and the Struggle Within|publisher=Springer Pub|year=2008|pages=232\u2013234|isbn=0826101186}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\u5357\u5c71\u7d93-\u4e5d\u5c3e\u72d0.svg|thumb|left|alt=Ancient Japanese sketch of a nine-tailed fox|Amy Plumb relates Naruto's development to the mythology of the [[kitsune]].<ref name=\"Plumb\"/>]]\nChristopher A.

Serving as the [[eponym]]ous [[protagonist]] of the series, he is a young [[ninja]] from the fictional village of Konohagakure. The villagers ridicule Naruto on account of the [[Nine-Tailed Demon Fox]]\u2014a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure\u2014that was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and [[original video animation]]s (OVA), as well as the sequel ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'', where his son, [[Boruto Uzumaki]], is the protagonist.\n\nWhen creating Naruto for the [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|initial part]] of the series, Kishimoto kept the character \"simple and stupid\", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with different clothes intended to appeal to Western audiences and to make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II)|Part II]] of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by [[Junko Takeuchi]] in the original animated series and [[Maile Flanagan]] in the English adaptations.\n\nMerchandise based on Naruto includes [[Action figure|figurines]] and [[keychain]]s. Naruto's character development has been praised by anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other ''sh\u014dnen'' manga, others have praised his personality and character development as he avoids stereotypes typically seen in similar media.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n===Original concept and influences===\n[[File:NarutoUzumakiKishimoto.jpg|alt=Naruto Uzumaki in his regular orange jumpsuit doing a handsign|thumb|upright|Original sketch for Naruto in Kishimoto's one-shot, ''Naruto'' (1997), which went through several alterations for the manga series due to its amount of detail|left]]\nDuring the 1990s, new manga author [[Masashi Kishimoto]] sought to write a one-shot chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of ''Naruto'' for the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Akamaru Jump]]'' magazine based on the idea.<ref name=\"kizuna\">{{cite book|title=Naruto \u2013 \u30ca\u30eb\u30c8 \u2013 \u540d\u8a00\u96c6\u3000\u7d46 \u2013 Kizuna \u2013\u3000\u5929\u30ce\u5dfb|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=2013|isbn=978-4087206814|pages=188\u2013195|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|language=Japanese|trans-title=Naruto Kizuna: The Words That Bind \u2013 Scroll of Heaven}}</ref> When comparing both the ''Naruto'' one-shot and his other work, ''Karakuri'', Kishimoto realized that former's title character was more appealing than the lead of ''Karakuri''. Kishimoto reflects Naruto's \"honest\" smile was well received in contrast to the sly look the main character from ''Karakuri'' had. Following the success of another one-shot, ''Mario'', Kishimoto started working on the ''Naruto'' series where he wanted to reuse the title character from his earlier one-shot. Kishimoto's editor, Kosuke Yahagi, told him to write two chapters heavily focused on Naruto Uzumaki in order to show his appeal to the readers and then focus on the other protagonists. Both Yahagi and Kishimoto noted the manga's second chapter was the most difficult to write early in the series as it was meant to work on Naruto's traits and how they impact on the character [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]]. Following the second chapter, Yahagi advised Kishimoto to introduce the misrelationships Naruto had with the main cast, including his rivalry with [[Sasuke Uchiha]] and his failure at trying to attract his love interest [[Sakura Haruno]]. Although Yahagi was not Kishimoto's editor for the entire serialization, he knew how the story was planned to show Naruto's coming-of-age through multiple fights and looked forward to seeing the conclusion.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Jump Square]]|title=Naruto: The Beginning|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|issue=12\u201314|date=December 2014|author=}}</ref>\n\nFor the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by [[Goku]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise.

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from the [[CyberConnect2]] develop who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight to look realistic, giving Sasuke scary look as well the hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact.

The principal reason for this was a significant difference between the two main characters, Naruto who had no knowledge of wars, and Sasuke who was a victim of one; his entire clan had been annihilated to avoid a potential civil war. As a result, Kishimoto created Nagato as a war victim who would Jiraiya, and act as Naruto's nemesis so he would understand the tragedy that Sasuke had experienced.<ref name=\"Koba\"/> As a result, Naruto's coming-of-age would have been completed in this arc and the final arc where Naruto deals with world war and develops a vision of the shinobi world as well as how he should handle the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2014/12/04/27837.html|title=\u3010\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff0f\u524d\u7de8\u3011\u300cNARUTO-\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8-\u300d\u539f\u4f5c\u8005\u30fb\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u5fcd\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3|publisher=Cinema Cafe|language=Japanese|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the original Japanese versions of ''Naruto'', Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum \"''-ttebayo''\" (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with \"you know?\" in English).
