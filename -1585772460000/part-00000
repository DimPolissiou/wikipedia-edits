However, he also believes that her trip to Ireland was a definitive experience, exposing her to the harsh reality of Ireland's social and economic conditions. Hughes eventually adopted the Irish equivalent of her name: Caitl\u00edn N\u00ed Aodha.

She returned to Canada in autumn 1915 to begin this assignment, but two events complicated her situation. Van Horne died in September and the 1916 Irish Uprising had occured. After the uprising, Hughes had a renewed zeal for Irish independence and promoted Irish self-determination while writing Van Horne's biography. By 1918, Hughes had lectured in every Canadian province and in several U.S. states.

[[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} The eleven movements of a symmetrical structure employ three to five voices in different combinations. Bach used means of [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt an earlier dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorales from the motet were part of a manuscript collection of chorale settings around 1735. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. The work, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]] in his position as [[Thomaskantor]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed cycles of [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]] for the Sundays and feast days of the Lutheran liturgical calendar. He wrote some church cantatas for occasions such as weddings and funerals. He also composed [[Motet (Bach)|motets]], probably as comparable occasional works.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''colla parte'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912 that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]].

The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five.

The text, in the first person, speaks of longing for Jesus.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Jones noted that the tenor part is particularly expressive.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The last movement has exactly the same music to the different text of the last stanza, creating a frame.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 2 ====\nThe second movement begins with excerpts from the Epistle to the Romans with \"{{lang|de|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches an denen, die in Christo Jesu sind|italic=no}}\" (Now there is nothing damnable in those who are in Christ Jesus).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The difference of living in the flesh and the spirit is an aspect that will be repeated  throughout the motet.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The movement is also in E minor, but for five voices.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=4}} The text is rendered first in rhetorical homophony.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nIn setting the first sentence, Bach accented the word \"nichts\" (nothing), repeating it twice, with long rests and echo dynamics. Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the following verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Defiance is expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe structure of the motet is unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived. Three of the chorales, movements 1 (which is the same as 11), 3 and 7 are contained in Dietel's manuscript, a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated around 1735.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nWith the other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA), edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to describe the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was the first of Bach's motets to be recorded in 1927. This version was sung in English translation and was conducted by [[Charles Kennedy Scott]].<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> It has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} Performers have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small choir or larger group, continuo, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]].

[[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} The eleven movements of a symmetrical structure employ three to five voices in different combinations. Bach used means of [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt an earlier dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorales from the motet were part of a manuscript collection of chorale settings around 1735. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. The work, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]] in his position as [[Thomaskantor]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed cycles of [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]] for the Sundays and feast days of the Lutheran liturgical calendar. He wrote some church cantatas for occasions such as weddings and funerals. He also composed [[Motet (Bach)|motets]], probably as comparable occasional works.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''colla parte'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912 that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]]. The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet, thus the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723 and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text ===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The [[stanza]]s are in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of the last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\nIn the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers take as their text one verse from the epistle writing.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\n=== Chorale melody ===\nThe chorale melody was composed by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653) and first appeared in his hymnal ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''. The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing [[colla parte]] in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the following verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Defiance is expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe structure of the motet is unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived. Three of the chorales, movements 1 (which is the same as 11), 3 and 7 are contained in Dietel's manuscript, a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated around 1735.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nWith the other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA), edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to describe the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was the first of Bach's motets to be recorded in 1927. This version was sung in English translation and was conducted by [[Charles Kennedy Scott]].<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> It has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} Performers have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small choir or larger group, continuo, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989. [[Masaaki Suzuki]] conducted performances of the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] in 2009, using instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n''Bach Digital''\n* {{cite web\n| url = https://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000284\n| title =  Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227; BC C 5 \n| website = [[Bach Digital]]\n| year = 2020\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = {{sfnref|Bach Digital|2020}}\n}}\n\n''Books''\n* {{cite book\n| last = Ameln\n| first = Konrad\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = Bach, Johann Sebastian / Jesu, meine Freude for five-part mixed choir in E minor BWV 227\n| website = [[B\u00e4renreiter]]\n| date = 1965\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = harv\n}} ISMN 979-0-00-649848-2\n* {{cite web\n| last = Gardiner\n| first = John Eliot\n| authorlink = John Eliot Gardiner\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT350\n| title = Music in the Castle of Heaven: A Portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach\n| publisher = Penguin UK\n| date = 2013\n| pages = 350\u2013352\n| isbn = 978-1-84-614721-0\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| translator-last1 = Coombs\n| translator-first1 = John\n| date = 2002\n| editor-last = Graulich\n| editor-first = G\u00fcnter\n| editor-link = G\u00fcnter Graulich\n| editor2-last = Wolf\n| editor2-first = Uwe\n| editor2-link = Uwe Wolf (musicologist)\n| title = Johann Sebastian Bach / Motetten / Motets\n| url = https://www.carusmedia.com/images-intern/medien/30/3122410/3122410x.pdf\n| type = [[Urtext edition|Urtext]], full score\n| series = Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben\n| language = de, en\n| publisher = [[Carus Verlag|Carus]]\n| id = CV 31.224\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| translator-last1 = Lunn\n| translator-first1 = Jean\n| date = 2003\n| editor-last = Graulich\n| editor-first = G\u00fcnter\n| editor-link = G\u00fcnter Graulich\n| editor2-last = Wolf\n| editor2-first = Uwe\n| editor2-link = Uwe Wolf (musicologist)\n| title = Johann Sebastian Bach: Jesu, meine Freude / Jesus, my salvation \u2013 BWV 227\n| url = https://www.carusmedia.com/images-intern/medien/30/3122700/3122700x.pdf\n| type = [[Urtext edition|Urtext]], full score\n| series = Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben\n| language = de, en\n| others = Continuo realisation by Horn, Paul\n| publisher = [[Carus Verlag|Carus]]\n| id = CV 31.227\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last = Hofmann\n| first = Klaus\n| authorlink = Klaus Hofmann\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = J.

This has actually happened twice in the five elections to date, with exact ties in [[Akulliq]] in the [[2008 Nunavut general election]] and in [[Rankin Inlet South]] in the [[2013 Nunavut general election]]. In such an event, Nunavut's practice is to schedule a follow-up [[by-election]] rather than choosing the winning candidate by an arbitrary method. The territory has also had numerous instances where MLAs were directly [[acclamation|acclaimed]] to office as the only person to register their candidacy by the deadline, as well as one instance where a follow-up by-election had to be held due to no candidates registering for the regular election in their district at all.\n\nOwing to Nunavut's vast size, the stated goal of the territorial government has been to decentralize governance beyond the region's capital.

{"title_page": "Ambrosia beetle", "text_new": "'''Ambrosia beetles'''          are beetles of the [[weevil]] subfamilies [[Scolytinae]] and [[Platypodinae]] ([[Coleoptera]], [[Curculionidae]]), which live in nutritional [[symbiosis]] with [[ambrosia fungi]]. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead or stressed trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition.\nAfter landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases [[spore]]s of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's [[xylem]] tissue, extracts nutrients from it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery. Ambrosia fungi are typically poor wood degraders, and instead utilize less demanding nutrients.<ref>Kasson, M.T., Wickert, K.L., Stauder, C.M., Macias, A.M., Berger, M.C., Simmons, D.R., Short, D.P., DeVallance, D.B. and Hulcr, J., 2016.

Fungal Ecology, 23, pp.86-96.</ref> The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of recently dead trees, but some attack stressed trees that are still alive, and a few species attack healthy trees.<ref name= Hulcr2017>Hulcr, J. and Stelinski, L.L., 2017. The ambrosia symbiosis: From evolutionary ecology to practical management. Annual Review of Entomology, 62, pp.285-303.</ref> Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels (\"galleries\"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most [[phytophagous]] organisms including the closely related [[bark beetle]]s.\nOne species of ambrosia beetle, ''[[Austroplatypus incompertus]]'' exhibits [[eusociality]], one of the few organisms outside of [[Hymenoptera]] and [[Isoptera]] to do so.\n\n==Classification and diversity==\n[[Image:Xylosandrus crassiusculus galleryR.jpg|thumb|left|Gallery of ''[[Xylosandrus crassiusculus]]'' split open, with pupae and black fungus]]\n\nUntil recently ambrosia beetles have been placed in independent families Scolytidae and Platypodidae, however, they are in fact some of the most highly derived [[weevils]], and are now placed in the subfamilies [[Scolytinae]] and [[Platypodinae]] of Family [[Curculionidae]]<ref>Kuschel, G., R.

Bark beetles: biology and ecology of native and invasive species, pp.41-84.</ref>\n\nAmbrosia beetles are an [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guild]], but not a [[Clade|phylogenetic clade]]. The ambrosia habit is an example of [[convergent evolution]], as several groups evolved the same symbiotic relationship independently.<ref>Farrell, B. D., A. S. O. Sequeira, et al. (2001): The evolution of agriculture in beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae). Evolution 55: 2011-2027.</ref> The highest diversity of ambrosia beetles is in the tropics. In the [[Paleotropical]] region, hundreds of species of [[Xyleborini]] and [[Platypodinae]] are the main agent initiating dead wood decomposition. In the [[Neotropic]]s, [[Platypodinae]] and [[Xyleborini]] are joined by the scolytine tribe [[Cortylini]]. Compared to the diversity in the tropics, ambrosia beetle fauna in the temperate zone is rather limited. In the [[Nearctic]] region it is dominated by a few species from Cortylini, Xyleborini and [[Xyloterini]]. In the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]], significant groups are Xyloterini and Xyleborini, joined by [[Scolytoplatypodini]] in the Far East.\n\n[[Image:Dinoplatypus chevrolati.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dinoplatypus chevrolati]]'' from Papua New Guinea, an example of Platypodinae, another species-rich group of ambrosia beetles]]\n\n==The symbiotic relationship==\nBeetles and their [[larva]]e graze on [[mycelium]] exposed on the gallery walls and on bodies called [[sporodochia]], clusters of the fungus' spores. Most ambrosia beetle species don't ingest the wood tissue; instead, the sawdust resulting from the excavation is pushed out of the gallery. Following the larval and pupal stage, adult ambrosia beetles collect masses of fungal spores into their [[mycangium|mycangia]] and leave the gallery to find their own tree.\n\nA few dozen species of ambrosia fungi have been described, currently in the genera ''[[Ambrosiella]]'', ''[[Meredithiella]]'', and ''[[Phialophoropsis]]'' (from [[Microascales]]), ''[[Afroraffaelea]]'' and ''[[Raffaelea]]'' (from Ophiostomatales), ''[[Ambrosiozyma]]'' ([[Saccharomycetales]]), ''[[Fusarium]]'' and ''[[Geosmithia]]'' (from [[Hypocreales]]),  and ''[[Flavodon]]'' (from [[Basidiomycota]]).<ref name= Hulcr2017 /> Many more species remain to be discovered. Little is known about the [[bionomy]] or specificity of ambrosia fungi. Ambrosia fungi are thought to be dependent on transport and inoculation provided by their beetle symbionts, as they have not been found in any other [[habitat]]. All ambrosia fungi are probably [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] and clonal.<ref>Malloch, D., and M. Blackwell. 1993. Dispersal biology of ophiostomatoid fungi. p. 195-206.

Repeated evolution of theft in fungus farming ambrosia beetles. Evolution, 64 (11): 3205-3212</ref>\n\n==Evolutionary origin==\nDuring their evolution, most scolytid and platypodid weevils became progressively more or less dependent on fungi regularly co-habiting dead trees. This evolution had various outcomes in different groups:\n* Some [[phloem]]-eating bark beetles (phloeophages) are vectors of [[phytopathogen]]ic fungi, which in some cases contribute to tree death.<ref>Paine, T. D., K. F. Raffa, et al. (1997): Interactions between scolytid bark beetles, their associated fungi and live host [[conifer]]s. Annual Review of Entomology 42: 179-206.</ref> The extent to which fungal pathogenicity benefits the beetles themselves is not at all trivial and remains disputed.<ref>Six, D.L. and Wingfield, M.J., 2011. The role of phytopathogenicity in bark beetle\u2013fungus symbioses: a challenge to the classic paradigm. Annual Review of Entomology, 56, pp.255-272.</ref>\n* Many of phloem-feeding bark beetles use phloem-infesting fungi as an addition to their diet. Some phloeophages became dependent on such a mixed diet and evolved [[mycangium|mycangia]] to transport their symbionts from maternal trees to newly infested trees.<ref>Klepzik, K. D. and D. L. Six (2004): Bark Beetle&nbsp;\u2013 Fungal Symbiosis: Context Dependency in Complex Associations. Symbiosis 37: 189-205.</ref> These beetles are called ''mycophloeophages''.\n* Ambrosia beetles and ambrosia fungi are thus only one end of the spectrum of the [[symbiosis|weevil-fungus association]], where both the beetle and the fungus became completely dependent on each other.<ref>Beaver, R. A. (1989): Insect-Fungus Relationship in the Bark and Ambrosia Beetles. Insect-Fungus Interactions. N. Wilding, N. M. Collins, P. M. Hammond and J. F. Webber, Academic Press: 121-143.</ref>\n\n==Impact on forests==\n\nThe vast majority of ambrosia beetles colonize dead trees, and have minor or no economic effect. A few species are able to colonize living stressed trees (Xylosandrus).<ref>Ranger, C.M., Reding, M.E., Persad, A.B. and Herms, D.A., 2010. Ability of stress\u2010related volatiles to attract and induce attacks by Xylosandrus germanus and other ambrosia beetles. Agricultural and Forest Entomology, 12(2), pp.177-185.</ref> A few species are able to attack live and healthy trees, and those can reach epidemic proportions in non-native, invaded regions (''Xyleborus glabratus'', ''Euwallacea fornicatus''<ref>Hulcr, J., Black, A., Prior, K., Chen, C.Y. and Li, H.F., 2017. Studies of ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in their native ranges help predict invasion impact. Florida Entomologist, 100(2), pp.257-261.</ref>).\n\nBeetle species that readily colonize lumber, such as sawlogs, green lumber, and stave-bolts, often cause region-specific economic loss from the pinhole and stained-wood defects caused by their brood galleries.

The beetles excavate tunnels in dead or stressed trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition.\nAfter landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases [[spore]]s of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's [[xylem]] tissue, extracts nutrients from it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery. Ambrosia fungi are typically poor wood degraders, and instead utilize less demanding nutrients.<ref>Kasson, M.T., Wickert, K.L., Stauder, C.M., Macias, A.M., Berger, M.C., Simmons, D.R., Short, D.P., DeVallance, D.B. and Hulcr, J., 2016.

However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most [[phytophagous]] organisms including the closely related [[bark beetle]]s.\nOne species of ambrosia beetle, ''[[Austroplatypus incompertus]]'' exhibits [[eusociality]], one of the few organisms outside of [[Hymenoptera]] and [[Isoptera]] to do so.\n\n==Classification and diversity==\n[[Image:Xylosandrus crassiusculus galleryR.jpg|thumb|left|Gallery of ''[[Xylosandrus crassiusculus]]'' split open, with pupae and black fungus]]\n\nUntil recently ambrosia beetles have been placed in independent families Scolytidae and Platypodidae, however, they are in fact some of the most highly derived [[weevils]], and are now placed in the subfamilies [[Scolytinae]] and [[Platypodinae]] of Family [[Curculionidae]]<ref>Kuschel, G., R.

The ambrosia habit is an example of [[convergent evolution]], as several groups evolved the same symbiotic relationship independently.<ref>Farrell, B. D., A. S. O. Sequeira, et al. (2001): The evolution of agriculture in beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae). Evolution 55: 2011-2027.</ref> The highest diversity of ambrosia beetles is in the tropics. In the [[Paleotropical]] region, hundreds of species of [[Xyleborini]] and [[Platypodinae]] are the main agent initiating dead wood decomposition. In the [[Neotropic]]s, [[Platypodinae]] and [[Xyleborini]] are joined by the scolytine tribe [[Cortylini]]. Compared to the diversity in the tropics, ambrosia beetle fauna in the temperate zone is rather limited. In the [[Nearctic]] region it is dominated by a few species from Cortylini, Xyleborini and [[Xyloterini]]. In the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]], significant groups are Xyloterini and Xyleborini, joined by [[Scolytoplatypodini]] in the Far East.\n\n[[Image:Dinoplatypus chevrolati.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Dinoplatypus chevrolati]]'' from Papua New Guinea, an example of Platypodinae, another species-rich group of ambrosia beetles]]\n\n==The symbiotic relationship==\nBeetles and their [[larva]]e graze on [[mycelium]] exposed on the gallery walls and on bodies called [[sporodochia]], clusters of the fungus' spores. Most ambrosia beetle species don't ingest the wood tissue; instead, the sawdust resulting from the excavation is pushed out of the gallery. Following the larval and pupal stage, adult ambrosia beetles collect masses of fungal spores into their [[mycangium|mycangia]] and leave the gallery to find their own tree.\n\nA few dozen species of ambrosia fungi have been described, currently in the genera ''[[Ambrosiella]]'', ''[[Meredithiella]]'', and ''[[Phialophoropsis]]'' (from [[Microascales]]), ''[[Afroraffaelea]]'' and ''[[Raffaelea]]'' (from Ophiostomatales), ''[[Ambrosiozyma]]'' ([[Saccharomycetales]]), ''[[Fusarium]]'' and ''[[Geosmithia]]'' (from [[Hypocreales]]),  and ''[[Flavodon]]'' (from [[Basidiomycota]]).<ref name= Hulcr2017 /> Many more species remain to be discovered. Little is known about the [[bionomy]] or specificity of ambrosia fungi. Ambrosia fungi are thought to be dependent on transport and inoculation provided by their beetle symbionts, as they have not been found in any other [[habitat]]. All ambrosia fungi are probably [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] and clonal.<ref>Malloch, D., and M. Blackwell. 1993. Dispersal biology of ophiostomatoid fungi. p. 195-206.

Repeated evolution of theft in fungus farming ambrosia beetles. Evolution, 64 (11): 3205-3212</ref>\n\n==Evolutionary origin==\nDuring their evolution, most scolytid and platypodid weevils became progressively more or less dependent on fungi regularly co-habiting dead trees. This evolution had various outcomes in different groups:\n* Some [[phloem]]-eating bark beetles (phloeophages) are vectors of [[phytopathogen]]ic fungi, which in some cases contribute to tree death.<ref>Paine, T. D., K. F. Raffa, et al. (1997): Interactions between scolytid bark beetles, their associated fungi and live host [[conifer]]s. Annual Review of Entomology 42: 179-206.</ref> The extent to which fungal pathogenicity benefits the beetles themselves is not at all trivial and remains disputed.<ref>Six, D.L. and Wingfield, M.J., 2011. The role of phytopathogenicity in bark beetle\u2013fungus symbioses: a challenge to the classic paradigm. Annual Review of Entomology, 56, pp.255-272.</ref>\n* Many of phloem-feeding bark beetles use phloem-infesting fungi as an addition to their diet. Some phloeophages became dependent on such a mixed diet and evolved [[mycangium|mycangia]] to transport their symbionts from maternal trees to newly infested trees.<ref>Klepzik, K. D. and D. L. Six (2004): Bark Beetle&nbsp;\u2013 Fungal Symbiosis: Context Dependency in Complex Associations. Symbiosis 37: 189-205.</ref> These beetles are called ''mycophloeophages''.\n* Ambrosia beetles and ambrosia fungi are thus only one end of the spectrum of the [[symbiosis|weevil-fungus association]], where both the beetle and the fungus became completely dependent on each other.<ref>Beaver, R. A. (1989): Insect-Fungus Relationship in the Bark and Ambrosia Beetles. Insect-Fungus Interactions. N. Wilding, N. M. Collins, P. M. Hammond and J. F.

The two main classes of sound recording technology are [[analog recording]] and [[digital recording]].\n\nAcoustic analog recording is achieved by a [[microphone diaphragm]] that senses changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] caused by [[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker diaphragm]] causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.\n\nDigital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a [[Digital audio|digital form]] by the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. This lets the audio data be stored and [[Data transmission|transmitted]] by a wider variety of media.  Digital recording stores audio as a series of [[binary number]]s (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the [[audio signal]] at equal time intervals, at a [[sample rate]] high enough to convey all sounds capable of being [[Hearing (sense)|heard]]. A [[digital audio]] signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is [[power amplifier|amplified]] and connected to a [[loudspeaker]] to produce sound.\n\nPrior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up [[music box]]es and, later, [[player piano]]s, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.\n\n==Pre-history==\n[[File:dukirch.gif|thumb|right|170px|Mechanical organ, 1650.]]\n\n{{See also|History of sound recording}}\n\nLong before [[sound]] was first recorded, music was recorded\u2014first by written [[music notation]], then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up [[music box]]es, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a [[melody]]). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a [[hydropower]]ed (water-powered) [[Organ (music)|organ]] that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B.

The [[player piano]], first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904.

Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the [[Edison Disc Record]] in an attempt to regain his market. The double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a ''de facto'' industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the [[stroboscope]]s used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=Peter|title=Manual of Analogue Audio Restoration Techniques|date=2008|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=89\u201390|url=http://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/subjects%20images/sound/analoguesoundrestoration.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref>  The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the \"seventy-eight\" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were manufactured.\n\nEarlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range.  Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a [[Stroh violin]] which uses a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that in turn is connected to the violin bridge. The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.\n\nThe long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[LP record]], was developed at [[Columbia Records]] and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the 78 lingered on far into the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable. The compact 45 format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \"unbreakable\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \"unbreakable\" compared to wax cylinders.\n\n==Electrical recording==\n[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]\n\nSound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[telegraphone]],{{efn|The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is comparable to that of a contemporary telephone.}} it remained so until the 1920s. Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial [[digital recording]]s in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \"horn sound\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured. During this time, several radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording.\n\nIn 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the [[Audion]] [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.\n\nDuring World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a [[German U-boat]] for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.\n\nThe first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.\n\nSeveral record companies and independent inventors, notably [[Orlando Marsh]], experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded [[Autograph Records]] were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230521/http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |title=When Did Marsh Laboratories Begin to Make Electrical Recordings? |author=Allan Sutton}}</ref>\n\nTelephone industry giant [[Western Electric]] had research laboratories{{efn|In 1925 the laboratories reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and under the shared ownership of [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] and Western Electric.}} with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match.

They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior \"rubber line\" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.<ref>Maxfield, J. P. and H. C. Harrison. Methods of high-quality recording and reproduction of speech based on telephone research. ''Bell System Technical Journal,'' July 1926, 493\u2013523.</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nBy 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]]. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label [[Harmony Records|Harmony]] was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.\n\nComparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies \"dumbed down\" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Other recording formats==\nIn the 1920s, [[Phonofilm]] and other early motion picture sound systems employed [[sound-on-film|optical recording]] technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a \"sound track\". The [[movie projector|projector]] used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of \"[[sound film|talkies]]\" was spearheaded by ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), which used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on [[35 mm movie film]] include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with [[Dolby SR]] noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.\n\nThis period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the [[Wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]], which was based on the work of Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The following year, [[Ludwig Blattner]] began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm |title=The Blattnerphone |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The [[BBC]] started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] in March 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm |title=The Marconi-Stille Recorder - Page 1 |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 [[Magnetophon]] was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.\n\n==Magnetic tape==\n{{Main article|Tape recorder}}\n\n[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]\n\nAn important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&search=quick&pos=4&_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of [[AC Bias|AC biasing]] (first used in the 1920s for [[wire recorder]]s), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] with backing from [[Bing Crosby]] Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the [[Ampex]] company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.\n\n[[File:Tdkc60cassette.jpg|thumb|A typical Compact Cassette]]\n\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.\nWithin a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder\u2014the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948\u2014American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concr\u00e8te]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Beach Boys]].\n\nThe ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.\n\n==Stereo and hi-fi==\n{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}\n\nIn 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears.  This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone]] system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, [[Alan Blumlein]], a British electronics engineer working for [[EMI]], designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325.<ref>{{Cite patent\n | country = GB\n | number = 394325\n | title = Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems.\n | status = patent\n | gdate = 1933-06-14\n | fdate = 1931-12-14\n | pridate = 1932-11-10\n | inventor = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | invent1 = Blumlein, Alan Dower\n | assign1 = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | assign2 = Musical Industries, Limited\n | class = H04R1/40B; H04R11/12; H04R9/16; H04S1/00\n}}</ref> Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.\n\nIn the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \"[[Fantasound]]\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio\u2014and a fourth as a \"control\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \"[[Cinemascope]]\" four-track magnetic sound system.\n\nGerman audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] has issued all these recordings on [[compact disk|CD]]. ([[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since).  Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.\n\nTwo-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the ''Westrex stereo phonograph disc'', which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. [[Decca Records]] in England came out with [[FFRR technique|FFRR]] (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The [[Ernest Ansermet]] recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621034232/http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-06-21 |title=Decca's (ffrr) Frequency Series - History Of Vinyl 1 |website=Vinylrecordscollector.co.uk |accessdate=2017-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nRecord companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s\u2014then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating \"pseudo stereo\". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'') were remastered using the so-called \"[[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|fake stereo]]\" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.\n\n==1950s to 1980s==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\n\nMagnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n\nThe next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the [[compact cassette]], commercialized by the [[Philips]] electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger [[8-track tape]] (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar \"Deutsche Cassette\" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl<!-- avoids BE/AE differences --> record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.\n\nA key advance in audio fidelity came with the [[Dolby A]] noise reduction system, invented by [[Ray Dolby]] and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]], invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization<!-- AE appears to be the established variant in this article --> and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.\n\nThe multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded [[8-track cartridge]] was launched as a consumer audio format by [[Bill Lear]] of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability \u2014 augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music \"compilations\" since 8-track recorders were rare \u2014 saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years \u2014 usually for special musical or cultural events \u2014 but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of [[Quadraphonic]] sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel [[hi-fi]] systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., [[CBS]], [[JVC]], [[Dynaco]] and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic [[Surround Sound]] systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.\n\n==Audio components==\n{{main article|High fidelity#Modularity}}\nThe replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry [[transistor]] also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity \"[[hi-fi]]\" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of \"modular\" hi-fi components \u2014 separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the [[graphic equaliser]], which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like [[Sony]] had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.\n\n==Digital recording==\n{{Main article|Digital recording}}\n{{See also|Pulse code modulation|Digital audio|Hard disk recorder|Digital audio workstation}}\n[[File:Pcm.svg|thumb|left|150px|Graphical representation of a sound wave in analog (red) and 4-bit digital (blue).]]\n\nThe advent of [[digital recording|digital sound recording]] and later the [[compact disc]] (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally [[Serial Copy Management System]], or SCMS).\n[[File:Sony-pcm-m10.jpg|right|thumb| A digital sound recorder from Sony]]\n\nThe most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital [[audio file format]]s, [[Microprocessor|processors]] capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in [[Real-time computing|real time]], and inexpensive [[mass storage]]<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society\n|volume=47\n|date=March 1991\n|title=The future of digital audio recording\n|author=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|authorlink=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322974158\n|pages=171\u2013172\n|quote=Keynote address was presented to the 104th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in Amsterdam during the society's golden anniversary celebration on May 17, 1998.}}</ref>\n.

Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the [[Medieval music|medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music (period)|Classical]], and through much of the [[Romantic music era]], the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were \"recorded\" was by notating the piece in [[music notation]]. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, [[Gregorian chant]] did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different.\n\nWith the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.\n\n==Legal status==\n\nIn copyright law, a \"phonogram\" or \"sound recording\" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the [[sound recording copyright symbol]], which the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] defines as \u2117 (the letter P in a full circle). This usually accompanies the copyright notice for the underlying musical composition, which uses the ordinary \u00a9 symbol.\n\nThe recording is separate from the song so copyright for a recording usually belongs to the record company. It is less common for an artist or producer to hold these rights. Copyright for recordings has existed since 1972, while copyright for musical composition, or songs, has existed since 1831. Disputes over [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and \"beats\" are ongoing.<ref name=\"hull2010\">{{cite book |last1=Hull |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Music Business and Recording Industry |date=2010 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0203843192 |pages=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXpMvQEACAAJ }}</ref>\n\n=== US ===\n\nUnited States copyright law defines \"sound recordings\" as \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds\" other than an audiovisual work's soundtrack.<ref>17 U.S.C. \u00a7101</ref> Prior to the Sound Recording Amendment (SRA),<ref>Pub.

The two main classes of sound recording technology are [[analog recording]] and [[digital recording]]. \n\nAcoustic analog recording is achieved by a [[microphone diaphragm]] that senses changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] caused by [[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker diaphragm]] causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.\n\nDigital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a [[Digital audio|digital form]] by the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. This lets the audio data be stored and [[Data transmission|transmitted]] by a wider variety of media.  Digital recording stores audio as a series of [[binary number]]s (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the [[audio signal]] at equal time intervals, at a [[sample rate]] high enough to convey all sounds capable of being [[Hearing (sense)|heard]]. A [[digital audio]] signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is [[power amplifier|amplified]] and connected to a [[loudspeaker]] to produce sound.\n\nPrior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up [[music box]]es and, later, [[player piano]]s, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.\n\n==Pre-history==\n[[File:dukirch.gif|thumb|right|170px|Mechanical organ, 1650.]]\n\n{{See also|History of sound recording}}\n\nLong before [[sound]] was first recorded, music was recorded\u2014first by written [[music notation]], then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up [[music box]]es, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a [[melody]]). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a [[hydropower]]ed (water-powered) [[Organ (music)|organ]] that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B. Fowler, this \"...cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century.\" The Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers also invented an automatic [[flute]] player, which appears to have been the first [[programmable machine]].<ref name=\"Fowler 45\u201349\">{{citation|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45\u201349|doi=10.2307/3391092|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3391092}}</ref><ref name=Koetsier>{{cite journal |last1=Koetsier |first1=Teun |year=2001 |title=On the prehistory of programmable machines: musical automata, looms, calculators |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=589\u2013603 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}</ref>\n\nCarvings in the [[Rosslyn Chapel]] from the 1560s may represent an early attempt to record the [[Chladni patterns]] produced by sound in stone representations, although this theory has not been conclusively proved.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosslyn Chapel: The Music of the Cubes |last=Mitchell |first=Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Diversions Books |location= |isbn=0-9554629-0-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tune into the Da Vinci coda |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/arts/tune_into_the_da_vinci_coda_1_466446 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, a mechanical bell-ringer controlled by a rotating cylinder was introduced in [[Flanders]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} Similar designs appeared in [[barrel organ]]s (15th century), [[musical clock]]s (1598), [[barrel piano]]s (1805), and [[music box]]es (ca. 1800). A music box is an automatic [[musical instrument]] that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or [[Lamellophone|''lamellae'']]) of a steel comb.\n\nThe [[fairground organ]], developed in 1892, used a system of accordion-folded punched cardboard books. The [[player piano]], first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904.

Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the [[Edison Disc Record]] in an attempt to regain his market. The double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a ''de facto'' industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the [[stroboscope]]s used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=Peter|title=Manual of Analogue Audio Restoration Techniques|date=2008|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=89\u201390|url=http://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/subjects%20images/sound/analoguesoundrestoration.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref>  The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the \"seventy-eight\" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were manufactured.\n\nEarlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range.  Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a [[Stroh violin]] which uses a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that in turn is connected to the violin bridge. The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.\n\nThe long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[LP record]], was developed at [[Columbia Records]] and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the 78 lingered on far into the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable. The compact 45 format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \"unbreakable\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \"unbreakable\" compared to wax cylinders.\n\n==Electrical recording==\n[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]\n\nSound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[telegraphone]],{{efn|The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is comparable to that of a contemporary telephone.}} it remained so until the 1920s. Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial [[digital recording]]s in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \"horn sound\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured. During this time, several radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording. \n\nIn 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the [[Audion]] [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.\n\nDuring World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a [[German U-boat]] for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.\n\nThe first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for [[The Unknown Warrior]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.\n\nSeveral record companies and independent inventors, notably [[Orlando Marsh]], experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded [[Autograph Records]] were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230521/http://www.mainspringpress.com/marsh_electric.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |title=When Did Marsh Laboratories Begin to Make Electrical Recordings? |author=Allan Sutton}}</ref>\n\nTelephone industry giant [[Western Electric]] had research laboratories{{efn|In 1925 the laboratories reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and under the shared ownership of [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] and Western Electric.}} with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match.

They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior \"rubber line\" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.<ref>Maxfield, J. P. and H. C. Harrison. Methods of high-quality recording and reproduction of speech based on telephone research. ''Bell System Technical Journal,'' July 1926, 493&ndash;523.</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nBy 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]]. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label [[Harmony Records|Harmony]] was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.\n\nComparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies \"dumbed down\" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Other recording formats==\nIn the 1920s, [[Phonofilm]] and other early motion picture sound systems employed [[sound-on-film|optical recording]] technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a \"sound track\". The [[movie projector|projector]] used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of \"[[sound film|talkies]]\" was spearheaded by ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), which used the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on [[35 mm movie film]] include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with [[Dolby SR]] noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.\n\nThis period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the [[Wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]], which was based on the work of Danish inventor [[Valdemar Poulsen]]. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The following year, [[Ludwig Blattner]] began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/blattner.htm |title=The Blattnerphone |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The [[BBC]] started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] in March 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm |title=The Marconi-Stille Recorder - Page 1 |website=Orbem.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref> The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 [[Magnetophon]] was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.\n\n==Magnetic tape==\n{{Main article|Tape recorder}}\n\n[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]\n\nAn important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&search=quick&pos=4&_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of [[AC Bias|AC biasing]] (first used in the 1920s for [[wire recorder]]s), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] with backing from [[Bing Crosby]] Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the [[Ampex]] company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.\n\n[[File:Tdkc60cassette.jpg|thumb|A typical Compact Cassette]]\n\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.\nWithin a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder \u2014 the Ampex 200 model, launched in 1948 \u2014 American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concr\u00e8te]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]], and [[The Beach Boys]].\n\nThe ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.\n\n==Stereo and hi-fi==\n{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}\n\nIn 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears.  This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone]] system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, [[Alan Blumlein]], a British electronics engineer working for [[EMI]], designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325.<ref>{{Cite patent\n | country = GB\n | number = 394325\n | title = Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems.\n | status = patent\n | gdate = 1933-06-14\n | fdate = 1931-12-14\n | pridate = 1932-11-10\n | inventor = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | invent1 = Blumlein, Alan Dower\n | assign1 = Alan Dower Blumlein\n | assign2 = Musical Industries, Limited\n | class = H04R1/40B; H04R11/12; H04R9/16; H04S1/00\n}}</ref> Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.\n\nIn the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \"[[Fantasound]]\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio\u2014and a fourth as a \"control\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \"[[Cinemascope]]\" four-track magnetic sound system.\n\nGerman audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] has issued all these recordings on [[compact disk|CD]]. ([[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since).  Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until [[Ampex]] introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.\n\nTwo-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the ''Westrex stereo phonograph disc'', which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. [[Decca Records]] in England came out with [[FFRR technique|FFRR]] (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The [[Ernest Ansermet]] recording of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]] was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621034232/http://www.vinylrecordscollector.co.uk/text/vinylhist14a.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-06-21 |title=Decca's (ffrr) Frequency Series - History Of Vinyl 1 |website=Vinylrecordscollector.co.uk |accessdate=2017-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nRecord companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s\u2014then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating \"pseudo stereo\". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'') were remastered using the so-called \"[[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|fake stereo]]\" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.\n\n==1950s to 1980s==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\n\nMagnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n\nThe next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the [[compact cassette]], commercialized by the [[Philips]] electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger [[8-track tape]] (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar \"Deutsche Cassette\" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl<!-- avoids BE/AE differences --> record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.\n\nA key advance in audio fidelity came with the [[Dolby A]] noise reduction system, invented by [[Ray Dolby]] and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]], invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization<!-- AE appears to be the established variant in this article --> and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.\n\nThe multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded [[8-track cartridge]] was launched as a consumer audio format by [[Bill Lear]] of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability &mdash; augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music \"compilations\" since 8-track recorders were rare &mdash; saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years &mdash; usually for special musical or cultural events &mdash; but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of [[Quadraphonic]] sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel [[hi-fi]] systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., [[CBS]], [[JVC]], [[Dynaco]] and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic [[Surround Sound]] systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.\n\n==Audio components==\n{{main article|High fidelity#Modularity}}\nThe replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry [[transistor]] also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity \"[[hi-fi]]\" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of \"modular\" hi-fi components &mdash; separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the [[graphic equaliser]], which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like [[Sony]] had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.\n\n==Digital recording==\n{{Main article|Digital recording}}\n{{See also|Pulse code modulation|Digital audio|Hard disk recorder|Digital audio workstation}}\n[[File:Pcm.svg|thumb|left|150px|Graphical representation of a sound wave in analog (red) and 4-bit digital (blue).]]\n\nThe advent of [[digital recording|digital sound recording]] and later the [[compact disc]] (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally [[Serial Copy Management System]], or SCMS).\n[[File:Sony-pcm-m10.jpg|right|thumb| A digital sound recorder from Sony]]\n\nThe most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital [[audio file format]]s, [[Microprocessor|processors]] capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in [[Real-time computing|real time]], and inexpensive [[mass storage]]<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society\n|volume=47 \n|date=March 1991\n|title=The future of digital audio recording\n|author=Kees Schouhamer Immink\n|authorlink=Kees Schouhamer Immink \n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322974158\n|pages=171\u2013172\n|quote=Keynote address was presented to the 104th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in Amsterdam during the society's golden anniversary celebration on May 17, 1998.}}</ref>\n.

The [[minidisc]] player, using [[ATRAC]] compression on small, cheap, re-writeable discs was introduced in the 1990s but became obsolescent as solid-state non-volatile [[flash memory]] dropped in price. As technologies that increase the amount of data that can be stored on a single medium, such as [[Super Audio CD]], [[DVD-A]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[HD DVD]] become available, longer programs of higher quality fit onto a single disc. Sound files are readily [[download]]ed from the Internet and other sources, and copied onto computers and digital audio players. Digital audio technology is now used in all areas of audio, from casual use of music files of moderate quality to the most demanding professional applications.

[[Digital dictation]] software for recording and transcribing speech has different requirements; intelligibility and flexible playback facilities are priorities, while a wide frequency range and high audio quality are not.\n\n==Cultural effects==\n[[File:Secretary Pompeo briefs the traveling press (42895283735).jpg|thumb|Many members of the media use recorders to capture remarks]]\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}\nThe development of analog sound recording in the nineteenth century and its widespread use throughout the twentieth century had a huge impact on the development of music. Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the [[Medieval music|medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music (period)|Classical]], and through much of the [[Romantic music era]], the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were \"recorded\" was by notating the piece in [[music notation]]. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, [[Gregorian chant]] did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different. \n\nWith the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.\n\n==Legal status==\n\nIn copyright law, a \"phonogram\" or \"sound recording\" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the [[sound recording copyright symbol]], which the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] defines as \u2117 (the letter P in a full circle). This usually accompanies the copyright notice for the underlying musical composition, which uses the ordinary \u00a9 symbol.\n\nThe recording is separate from the song so copyright for a recording usually belongs to the record company. It is less common for an artist or producer to hold these rights. Copyright for recordings has existed since 1972, while copyright for musical composition, or songs, has existed since 1831. Disputes over [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and \"beats\" are ongoing.<ref name=\"hull2010\">{{cite book |last1=Hull |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Music Business and Recording Industry |date=2010 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0203843192 |pages=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXpMvQEACAAJ }}</ref> \n\n=== US ===\n\nUnited States copyright law defines \"sound recordings\" as \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds\" other than an audiovisual work's soundtrack.<ref>17 U.S.C. \u00a7101</ref> Prior to the Sound Recording Amendment (SRA),<ref>Pub.

The limestone is topped with [[sand]]y soils deposited as ancient [[beach]]es over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell. During the [[last glacial period]], lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula, largely [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|savanna]].<ref name=\"Florida's Geological History\"/> The [[Everglades]], a wide, slow-flowing river, encompasses the southern tip of the peninsula.\n\nWhile there are sinkholes in much of the state, modern sinkholes have tended to be in West-Central Florida.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ann B.

Due to [[multilingualism]] among Lebanese people (a majority of the Lebanese people are bilingual or trilingual), it is not uncommon for [[Lebanese people]] to mix Lebanese Arabic, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] into their daily speech.\n\nLebanese Arabic has been assumed to  descend from the [[Old Arabic|Arabic dialects]] introduced to the [[Levant]] in the 7th century CE, which gradually supplanted various indigenous [[Northwest Semitic languages]] to become the regional [[lingua franca]]. As a result of this prolonged process of [[language shift]], Lebanese Arabic possesses a significant [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#substratum|substratum]], along with later non-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstrate]] influences from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], English, and [[French language in Lebanon|French]]. As a variety of [[Levantine Arabic]], Lebanese Arabic is most closely related to [[Syrian Arabic]] and shares many [[Levantine Arabic phonology|innovations]] with [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] and [[Jordanian Arabic]]. However some modern researchers have opposed the idea of descendance from Peninsular Arabic dialects, such as Ahmad Al-Jallad<ref>https://www.academia.edu/38100372/Al-Jallad._A_Manual_of_the_Historical_Grammar_of_Arabic</ref> and others. These hold that the vernaculars languages went through a parallel evolution.\n\n==Differences from Standard Arabic==\nLebanese Arabic shares many features with other modern varieties of [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Lebanese Arabic, like many other spoken Levantine Arabic varieties, has a syllable structure very different from that of [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. While Standard Arabic can have only one consonant at the beginning of a syllable, after which a vowel must follow, Lebanese Arabic commonly has two consonants in the onset.\n* Morphology: no [[Grammatical mood|mood]] or grammatical case markings.\n* Number: verbal agreement regarding number and gender is required for all subjects, whether already mentioned or not.\n* Vocabulary: many borrowings from other languages; most prominently [[Syriac language|Syriac-Aramaic]], [[Western Aramaic languages|Western-Aramaic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], French, as well as, less significantly, from English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cometolebanon.com/about-lebanon/languages|title=Languages|website=Come To Lebanon|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n* Some authors, such as the statistician [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], believe that a significant part of the Lebanese grammatical structure is due to [[Aramaic]] influences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2008/Nov-25/53151-you-may-think-youre-speaking-lebanese-but-some-of-your-words-are-really-syriac.ashx|title=You may think you're speaking Lebanese, but some of your words are really Syriac|date=2008-11-25|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/east-med-project-history-philology-and-genetics/no-lebanese-is-not-a-dialect-of-arabic-e95320c164c|title=No, Lebanese is not a \u201cdialect of\u201d Arabic|last=Taleb|first=Nassim Nicholas|date=2018-01-02|website=East Med Project: History, Philology, and Genetics|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Maya Diab interview in Morocco - Oct 28, 2017.webm|thumb|An interview with Lebanese singer [[Maya Diab]]; she speaks in Lebanese Arabic.]]\n* The following example demonstrates two differences between Standard Arabic (Literary Arabic) and Spoken Lebanese Arabic: [[Coffee]] ({{lang|ar|\u0642\u0647\u0648\u0629}}), Literary Arabic: {{IPA|/\u02c8qahwa/}}; Lebanese Arabic: {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0294ehwe]}}. The [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}} corresponds to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, and the final vowel ({{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u00e6}}~{{IPAplink|a}}~{{IPAplink|\u0250}}]}}) commonly written with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|t\u0101\u02be marb\u016btah}}'' ({{lang|ar|[[\u0629]]}}) is raised to {{IPAblink|e}}.\n* As a general rule, the [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}} is replaced with [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, e.g. {{IPA|/daqi\u02d0qa/}} \"minute\" becomes {{IPA|[de\u0294i\u02d0\u0294a]}}. This [[debuccalization]] of {{IPAslink|q}} is a feature shared with  [[Syrian Arabic]], [[Palestinian Arabic]], [[Egyptian Arabic]], and [[Maltese language|Maltese]].\n* The exception for this general rule is the [[Druze]] of Lebanon who, like the Druze of [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], have retained the pronunciation of {{IPAslink|q}} in the centre of direct neighbours who have substituted the {{IPAslink|q}} for the {{IPAblink|\u0294}} (example: \"Heart\" is {{IPA|/qalb/}} in Literary Arabic, becomes {{IPA|[\u0294elb]}}, which is similar in [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]], [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]], [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The use of {{IPAslink|q}} by Druze is particularly prominent in the mountains and less so in urban areas.\n* Unlike most other [[varieties of Arabic]], a few dialects of Lebanese Arabic have retained the classical diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} (pronounced in Lebanese Arabic as {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[e\u028a]}}<!--could a Lebanese Arabic user make sure that the previous sounds are correctly represented?-->), which were monophthongised into {{IPAblink|e\u02d0}} and {{IPAblink|o\u02d0}} elsewhere, although the majority of Lebanese Arabic dialects realize them as {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}}. In urban dialects (i.e. Beiruti) {{IPAblink|e\u02d0}} has replaced {{IPA|/aj/}} and medial {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, and {{IPAblink|e}} has replaced short {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} as well as final {{IPA|/i/}}, making it indistinguishable with t\u0101\u02be marb\u016btah (\u0629). Also, {{IPAblink|o\u02d0}} has replaced {{IPA|/aw/}}; {{IPAblink|o}} replacing short {{IPA|/u/}}s.\n* The {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} sound from Modern Standard Arabic is sometimes replaced with {{IPA|/t/}} in words from MSA like {{IPA|/\u03b8a:nija/}}, (second as in the number) when it becomes {{IPA|/te:nj\u0259/}}. Other times, it may be replaced with {{IPA|/s/}} in words like {{IPA|/\u03b8a:nija/}} (second as in the time measurement) when it becomes {{IPA|/se:nj\u0259/}}. It is assumed that this is to maintain an audible difference between the two words which were originally homophones. In some dialects, the {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} sound is replaced with {{IPA|/t/}} for both words.\n\n===Not Arabic===\n\nSeveral non-linguist commentators, including [[Nassim Taleb]], have claimed that the Lebanese vernacular is not in fact a [[variety of Arabic]] at all, but rather a separate [[Central Semitic language]] descended from older languages including [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]; those who espouse this viewpoint suggest that a large percentage of its vocabulary consists of Arabic [[loanword]]s, and that this compounds with the use of the [[Arabic alphabet]] to disguise the language's true nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/east-med-project-history-philology-and-genetics/no-lebanese-is-not-a-dialect-of-arabic-e95320c164c|title=No, Lebanese is not a \u201cdialect of\u201d Arabic|first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb|date=2 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Taleb has recommended that the language be called Northwestern Levantine or neo-[[Canaanite language|Canaanite]].<ref>https://www.maronite-heritage.com/Lebanese%20Language.php</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://phoenicia.org/leblanguage.html|title=Phoenicia: The Lebanese Language: What is the difference between the Arabic Language and the Lebanese language?|website=phoenicia.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebaneselanguage.org/language/history/|title=Lebanese Language Institute \u00bb History|website=www.lebaneselanguage.org}}</ref> Linguists reject this classification on the basis that it is easily disproved by the [[comparative method]] and other tools known to [[historical linguistics]], and that attempts to claim another ancestor for Lebanese are motivated more by [[nationalist]] politics than by a desire for linguistic impartiality.<ref>{{cite-web|url=http://lughat.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-levantine-is-arabic-not-aramaic.html|title=Jabal al-Lughat: Why \"Levantine\" is Arabic, not Aramaic: Part 1|first=Lameen Souag \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646|last=\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0642|date=7 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lughat.blogspot.com/2018/01/taleb-unintentionally-proves-lebanese.html|title=Jabal al-Lughat: Taleb unintentionally proves Lebanese comes from Arabic|first=Lameen Souag \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646|last=\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0642|date=4 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/i/moments/949816603981615110|title=Lebanese and Arabic - A Post-Mortem of the Nassim Taleb kerfuffle|website=Twitter}}</ref>. \n\nMore recently, Ahmad Al Jallad confirms that the so-called Arabic vernaculars do not descend from Arabic, but have followed a parallel evolution, what is called Classical Arabic is a more recent language with newer innovations than the so-called dialects.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/38100372/Al-Jallad._A_Manual_of_the_Historical_Grammar_of_Arabic</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lebanese Arabic Consonants\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar/]]<br />[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! <small>plain</small>\n! <small>[[pharyngealization|emphatic]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}} || {{IPA link|n}} || || || || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| ({{IPA link|p}}) || {{IPA link|t}} || {{IPA link|t\u02e4}} || ({{IPA link|t\u0361\u0283}}) || {{IPA link|k}} || || {{IPA link|\u0294}}\n|-\n! <small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|b}} || {{IPA link|d}} || {{IPA link|d\u02e4}} || || ({{IPA link|\u0261}}) || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|f}} || {{IPA link|s}} || {{IPA link|s\u02e4}} || {{IPA link|\u0283}} || {{IPA link|x}} || {{IPA link|\u0127}} || {{IPA link|h}}\n|-\n! <small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| ({{IPA link|v}}) || {{IPA link|z}} || {{IPA link|z\u02e4}} || {{IPA link|\u0292}} || {{IPA link|\u0263}} || {{IPA link|\u0295}} ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Tap consonant|Tap]]/[[Trill consonant|trill]]\n| || {{IPA link|r}} || || || || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant]]\n| || {{IPA link|l}} || || {{IPA link|j}} || {{IPA link|w}} || ||\n|}\n\n*The phonemes {{IPA|/p, v/}} are not native to Lebanese Arabic and are only found in loanwords.

Lebanese Arabic is also utilized in many Lebanese [[song]]s, theatrical pieces, local television and radio productions, and very prominently in [[zajal]].\n\nFormal publications in Lebanon, such as newspapers, are typically written in [[Modern Standard Arabic]], French, or English.\n\nWhile Arabic script is usually employed, informal usage such as [[Instant messaging|online chat]] may mix and match Latin letter [[Arabic chat alphabet|transliterations]]. The Lebanese poet [[Said Akl|Sa\u00efd Akl]] proposed the use of the Latin alphabet but did not gain wide acceptance. Whereas some works, such as ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Plato's Dialogues'' have been transliterated using such systems, they have not{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} gained widespread acceptance. Yet, now, most Arabic web users, when short of an Arabic keyboard, transliterate the Lebanese Arabic words in the Latin alphabet in a pattern similar to the [[Said Akl]] alphabet, the only difference being the use of digits to render the Arabic letters with no obvious equivalent in the Latin alphabet.\n\nThere is still today no generally accepted agreement on how to use the Latin alphabet to transliterate Lebanese Arabic words. However, Lebanese people are now using latin numbers while communicating online to make up for sounds not directly associable to latin letters. This is especially popular over text messages and apps such as [[WhatsApp]].\nExamples:\n* 7 for \u062d\n* 3 for \u0639\n* 2 for \u0621 or \u0642 (qaf is often pronounced as a glottal stop)\n\nIn 2010, The Lebanese Language Institute has released a Lebanese Arabic keyboard layout and made it easier to write Lebanese Arabic in a Latin script, using unicode-compatible symbols to substitute for missing sounds.<ref>Lebanese Language Institute: [http://www.lebaneselanguage.org/lll-system/lebanese-latin-letters/ Lebanese Latin Letters The Lebanese Latin Letters]</ref>\n\n===Said Akl's orthography===\n* Capitalization and punctuation are used normally the same way they are used in the French and English languages.\n* Some written consonant-letters, depending on their position, inherited a preceding vowel. As ''L'' and ''T''.\n* Emphatic consonants are not distinguished from normal ones, with the exception of {{IPA|/z\u02e4/}} represented by ''\u01b6''.

Due to [[multilingualism]] among Lebanese people (a majority of the Lebanese people are bilingual or trilingual), it is not uncommon for [[Lebanese people]] to mix Lebanese Arabic, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] into their daily speech.\n\nLebanese Arabic has been assumed to  descend from the [[Old Arabic|Arabic dialects]] introduced to the [[Levant]] in the 7th century CE, which gradually supplanted various indigenous [[Northwest Semitic languages]] to become the regional [[lingua franca]]. As a result of this prolonged process of [[language shift]], Lebanese Arabic possesses a significant [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#substratum|substratum]], along with later non-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstrate]] influences from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], English, and [[French language in Lebanon|French]]. As a variety of [[Levantine Arabic]], Lebanese Arabic is most closely related to [[Syrian Arabic]] and shares many [[Levantine Arabic phonology|innovations]] with [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] and [[Jordanian Arabic]]. However some modern researchers have opposed the idea of descendance from Peninsular Arabic dialects, such as Ahmad Al-Jallad<ref>https://www.academia.edu/38100372/Al-Jallad._A_Manual_of_the_Historical_Grammar_of_Arabic</ref> and others. These hold that the vernaculars languages went through a parallel evolution.\n\n==Differences from Standard Arabic==\nLebanese Arabic shares many features with other modern varieties of [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Lebanese Arabic, like many other spoken Levantine Arabic varieties, has a syllable structure very different from that of [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. While Standard Arabic can have only one consonant at the beginning of a syllable, after which a vowel must follow, Lebanese Arabic commonly has two consonants in the onset.\n* Morphology: no [[Grammatical mood|mood]] or grammatical case markings.\n* Number: verbal agreement regarding number and gender is required for all subjects, whether already mentioned or not.\n* Vocabulary: many borrowings from other languages; most prominently [[Syriac language|Syriac-Aramaic]], [[Western Aramaic languages|Western-Aramaic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], French, as well as, less significantly, from English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cometolebanon.com/about-lebanon/languages|title=Languages|website=Come To Lebanon|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n* Some authors, such as the statistician [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], believe that a significant part of the Lebanese grammatical structure is due to [[Aramaic]] influences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2008/Nov-25/53151-you-may-think-youre-speaking-lebanese-but-some-of-your-words-are-really-syriac.ashx|title=You may think you're speaking Lebanese, but some of your words are really Syriac|date=2008-11-25|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/east-med-project-history-philology-and-genetics/no-lebanese-is-not-a-dialect-of-arabic-e95320c164c|title=No, Lebanese is not a \u201cdialect of\u201d Arabic|last=Taleb|first=Nassim Nicholas|date=2018-01-02|website=East Med Project: History, Philology, and Genetics|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Maya Diab interview in Morocco - Oct 28, 2017.webm|thumb|An interview with Lebanese singer [[Maya Diab]]; she speaks in Lebanese Arabic.]]\n* The following example demonstrates two differences between Standard Arabic (Literary Arabic) and Spoken Lebanese Arabic: [[Coffee]] ({{lang|ar|\u0642\u0647\u0648\u0629}}), Literary Arabic: {{IPA|/\u02c8qahwa/}}; Lebanese Arabic: {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0294ahwe]}}. The [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}} corresponds to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, and the final vowel ({{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u00e6}}~{{IPAplink|a}}~{{IPAplink|\u0250}}]}}) commonly written with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|t\u0101\u02be marb\u016btah}}'' ({{lang|ar|[[\u0629]]}}) is raised to {{IPAblink|e}}.\n* As a general rule, the [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}} is replaced with [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, e.g. {{IPA|/daqi\u02d0qa/}} \"minute\" becomes {{IPA|[d\u0294i\u02d0\u0294a]}}. This [[debuccalization]] of {{IPAslink|q}} is a feature shared with  [[Syrian Arabic]], [[Palestinian Arabic]], [[Egyptian Arabic]], and [[Maltese language|Maltese]].\n* The exception for this general rule is the [[Druze]] of Lebanon who, like the Druze of [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], have retained the pronunciation of {{IPAslink|q}} in the centre of direct neighbours who have substituted the {{IPAslink|q}} for the {{IPAblink|\u0294}} (example: \"Heart\" is {{IPA|/qalb/}} in Literary Arabic, becomes {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0294aleb]}} or {{IPA|[\u0294alb]}}, which is similar in [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]], [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]], [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The use of {{IPAslink|q}} by Druze is particularly prominent in the mountains and less so in urban areas.\n* Unlike most other [[varieties of Arabic]], a few dialects of Lebanese Arabic have retained the classical diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} (pronounced in Lebanese Arabic as {{IPA|[e\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[e\u028a]}}<!--could a Lebanese Arabic user make sure that the previous sounds are correctly represented?-->), which were monophthongised into {{IPAblink|e\u02d0}} and {{IPAblink|o\u02d0}} elsewhere, although the majority of Lebanese Arabic dialects realize them as {{IPA|[o\u028a]}} and {{IPA|[e\u026a]}}. In urban dialects (i.e. Beiruti) {{IPAblink|e\u02d0}} has replaced {{IPA|/aj/}} and sometimes medial {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}, and {{IPAblink|e}} has replaced final {{IPA|/i/}} making it indistinguishable with t\u0101\u02be marb\u016btah (\u0629). Also, {{IPAblink|o\u02d0}} has replaced {{IPA|/aw/}}; {{IPAblink|o}} replacing some short {{IPA|/u/}}s. In singing, the {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{IPA|/aw/}} and medial {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} are usually maintained for artistic{{specify|date=December 2012}} values.\n* The {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} sound from Modern Standard Arabic is sometimes replaced with {{IPA|/t/}} in words from MSA like {{IPA|/\u03b8a:nija/}}, (second as in the number) when it becomes {{IPA|/te:nj\u0259/}}. Other times, it may be replaced with {{IPA|/s/}} in words like {{IPA|/\u03b8a:nija/}} (second as in the time measurement) when it becomes {{IPA|/se:nj\u0259/}}. It is assumed that this is to maintain an audible difference between the two words which were originally homophones. In some dialects, the {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} sound is replaced with {{IPA|/t/}} for both words.\n\n===Not Arabic===\n\nSeveral non-linguist commentators, including [[Nassim Taleb]], have claimed that the Lebanese vernacular is not in fact a [[variety of Arabic]] at all, but rather a separate [[Central Semitic language]] descended from older languages including [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]; those who espouse this viewpoint suggest that a large percentage of its vocabulary consists of Arabic [[loanword]]s, and that this compounds with the use of the [[Arabic alphabet]] to disguise the language's true nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/east-med-project-history-philology-and-genetics/no-lebanese-is-not-a-dialect-of-arabic-e95320c164c|title=No, Lebanese is not a \u201cdialect of\u201d Arabic|first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb|date=2 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Taleb has recommended that the language be called Northwestern Levantine or neo-[[Canaanite language|Canaanite]].<ref>https://www.maronite-heritage.com/Lebanese%20Language.php</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://phoenicia.org/leblanguage.html|title=Phoenicia: The Lebanese Language: What is the difference between the Arabic Language and the Lebanese language?|website=phoenicia.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebaneselanguage.org/language/history/|title=Lebanese Language Institute \u00bb History|website=www.lebaneselanguage.org}}</ref> Linguists reject this classification on the basis that it is easily disproved by the [[comparative method]] and other tools known to [[historical linguistics]], and that attempts to claim another ancestor for Lebanese are motivated more by [[nationalist]] politics than by a desire for linguistic impartiality.<ref>{{cite-web|url=http://lughat.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-levantine-is-arabic-not-aramaic.html|title=Jabal al-Lughat: Why \"Levantine\" is Arabic, not Aramaic: Part 1|first=Lameen Souag \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646|last=\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0642|date=7 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lughat.blogspot.com/2018/01/taleb-unintentionally-proves-lebanese.html|title=Jabal al-Lughat: Taleb unintentionally proves Lebanese comes from Arabic|first=Lameen Souag \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646|last=\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0642|date=4 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/i/moments/949816603981615110|title=Lebanese and Arabic - A Post-Mortem of the Nassim Taleb kerfuffle|website=Twitter}}</ref>. \n\nMore recently, Ahmad Al Jallad confirms that the so-called Arabic vernaculars do not descend from Arabic, but have followed a parallel evolution, what is called Classical Arabic is a more recent language with newer innovations than the so-called dialects.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/38100372/Al-Jallad._A_Manual_of_the_Historical_Grammar_of_Arabic</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lebanese Arabic Consonants\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar/]]<br />[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! <small>plain</small>\n! <small>[[pharyngealization|emphatic]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}} || {{IPA link|n}} || || || || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| ({{IPA link|p}}) || {{IPA link|t}} || {{IPA link|t\u02e4}} || ({{IPA link|t\u0361\u0283}}) || {{IPA link|k}} || || {{IPA link|\u0294}}\n|-\n! <small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|b}} || {{IPA link|d}} || {{IPA link|d\u02e4}} || || ({{IPA link|\u0261}}) || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! <small>[[voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|f}} || {{IPA link|s}} || {{IPA link|s\u02e4}} || {{IPA link|\u0283}} || {{IPA link|x}} || {{IPA link|\u0127}} || {{IPA link|h}}\n|-\n! <small>[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| ({{IPA link|v}}) || {{IPA link|z}} || {{IPA link|z\u02e4}} || {{IPA link|\u0292}} || {{IPA link|\u0263}} || {{IPA link|\u0295}} ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Tap consonant|Tap]]/[[Trill consonant|trill]]\n| || {{IPA link|r}} || || || || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant]]\n| || {{IPA link|l}} || || {{IPA link|j}} || {{IPA link|w}} || ||\n|}\n\n*The phonemes {{IPA|/p, v/}} are not native to Lebanese Arabic and are only found in loanwords.

Lebanese Arabic is also utilized in many Lebanese [[song]]s, theatrical pieces, local television and radio productions, and very prominently in [[zajal]].\n\nFormal publications in Lebanon, such as newspapers, are typically written in [[Modern Standard Arabic]], French, or English.\n\nWhile Arabic script is usually employed, informal usage such as [[Instant messaging|online chat]] may mix and match Latin letter [[Arabic chat alphabet|transliterations]]. The Lebanese poet [[Said Akl|Sa\u00efd Akl]] proposed the use of the Latin alphabet but did not gain wide acceptance. Whereas some works, such as ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Plato's Dialogues'' have been transliterated using such systems, they have not{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} gained widespread acceptance. Yet, now, most Arabic web users, when short of an Arabic keyboard, transliterate the Lebanese Arabic words in the Latin alphabet in a pattern similar to the [[Said Akl]] alphabet, the only difference being the use of digits to render the Arabic letters with no obvious equivalent in the Latin alphabet.\n\nThere is still today no generally accepted agreement on how to use the Latin alphabet to transliterate Lebanese Arabic words. However, Lebanese people are now using latin numbers while communicating online to make up for sounds not directly associable to latin letters. This is especially popular over text messages and apps such as [[WhatsApp]].\nExamples:\n* 7 for \u062d\n* 3 for \u0639\n* 2 for \u0621 or \u0642 (qaf is often pronounced as a glottal stop)\n\nIn 2010, The Lebanese Language Institute has released a Lebanese Arabic keyboard layout and made it easier to write Lebanese Arabic in a Latin script, using unicode-compatible symbols to substitute for missing sounds.<ref>Lebanese Language Institute: [http://www.lebaneselanguage.org/lll-system/lebanese-latin-letters/ Lebanese Latin Letters The Lebanese Latin Letters]</ref>\n\n===Said Akl's orthography===\n* Capitalization and punctuation are used normally the same way they are used in the French and English languages.\n* Some written consonant-letters, depending on their position, inherited a preceding vowel.
