The league consisted of 16 teams, the 13 best teams of the [[2009\u201310 Superleague Greece|2009\u201310 season]] and three teams that had been promoted from the [[2009\u201310 Beta Ethniki]].\n\nThe season began on 27 August 2010 with the first matches of the regular season<ref>{{cite web|title=Schedule of the 2010\u201311 season|url=http://www.superleaguegreece.net/schedule|publisher=[[Superleague Greece]]|accessdate=6 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101224025314/http://superleaguegreece.net/schedule| archivedate= 24 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> and ended on 25 May 2011 with the last matches of the [[#European playoffs|European playoff round]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Super League Greece \u2013 Champions \u00d6eague qualifiers Play-off fixtures and results|url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/greece/super-league/2010-2011/champions-league-qualifiers-play-off/matches/|work=Soccerway|publisher=[[Global Sports Media]]|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref> [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] were the defending champions, having won their 20th Greek championship in the [[2009\u201310 Superleague Greece|2009\u201310 season]].\n\nThe season was marred by [[Koriopolis]], a match-fixing scandal which involved several teams from the top three leagues of Greek football.\n\n== Season summary ==\n\n=== Title race ===\nThe league was won by [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], who earned their 38th Greek league title. They finished with a 13-point lead over runners-up [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], who had to compete in a [[#Playoffs|play-off round]] which determined the exact allocation of spots for both European competitions.\n\nPanathinaikos was joined in the play-offs by third-placed club and city rivals [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], fourth-placed [[PAOK FC|PAOK]] and fifth-placed [[Ethnikos Olympiakos Volos F.C.|Olympiakos Volou]]. Panathinaikos eventually won the play-off group and thus earned the second Greek spot in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League]]. Since AEK had already won the [[2010\u201311 Greek Cup]] competition a few weeks earlier and thus were already qualified for the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League]], both PAOK and Olympiakos Volos were guaranteed a spot in that competition as well.\n\n=== Relegation ===\n{{See also|Koriopolis}}\nAfter thirty matches, the relegation spots were occupied by 14th-placed [[Asteras Tripolis F.C.|Asteras Tripolis]], 15th-placed [[Larissa F.C.|Larissa]] and last-placed [[Panserraikos F.C.|Panserraikos]]. However, all three clubs eventually stayed in the league after [[Iraklis 1908 Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]], [[Kavala F.C.|Kavala]] and [[Ethnikos Olympiakos Volos F.C.|Olympiakos Volou]] were demoted by separate sports court decisions.\n\nOn 19 May 2011, Iraklis were denied a licence for the 2011\u201312 season over unpaid debts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18771:2011-04-20-12-07-48&catid=83:2010-02-22-21-13-22&Itemid=291|title=\u0391nnouncement for the teams receiving UEFA licence for the 2011\u201312 season (in greek)|work=Hellenic Football Federation|accessdate=16 May 2011|publisher=epo.gr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426115413/http://www.epo.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18771:2011-04-20-12-07-48&catid=83:2010-02-22-21-13-22&Itemid=291|archive-date=26 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and thus demoted to the second-level [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]].

Super League Greece]\n}}\n\n==Playoffs==\nIn the play-off for Champions League, the four teams play each other in a home and away [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]]. However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five and rounded to the nearest whole number of points, if necessary, to give the other teams the points with which they start the mini-league.\n\nFifth-placed club Olympiakos Volou earned 47 points during the regular season. Based on this number and the calculations above, Panathinaikos as runners-up will begin the playoff with three points ((60\u201347)/5 = 2.6, rounded up to 3), while AEK Athens will start with one point ((50\u201347)/5 = 0.6, rounded up to 1) and P.A.O.K. with no points ((48\u201347)/5 = 0.2, rounded down to 0).\n\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|section=Play-offs\n|show_limit = 5\n|res_col_header=Q\n\n|highest_pos=2\n|team2=PAT|team3=PAOK|team4=AEK|team5=OVL\n\n<!--\nadjust_points parameter denotes starting points for the first three teams\n-->\n\n|win_PAT=3|draw_PAT=1|loss_PAT=2|gf_PAT=9|ga_PAT=5|adjust_points_PAT=3\n|win_PAOK=4|draw_PAOK=0|loss_PAOK=2|gf_PAOK=11|ga_PAOK=8|adjust_points_PAOK=0\n|win_AEK=2|draw_AEK=1|loss_AEK=3|gf_AEK=6|ga_AEK=6|adjust_points_AEK=1\n|win_OVL=2|draw_OVL=0|loss_OVL=4|gf_OVL=5|ga_OVL=12|adjust_points_OVL=0\n|col_CL3=green2|text_CL3=Qualification for [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]]\n|result2=CL3\n|col_EL3=blue2|text_EL3=Qualification for [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League#Third qualifying round|Europa League third qualifying round]]\n|result3=EL3\n|col_ELPR=blue1|text_ELPR=Qualification for [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League#Play-off round|Europa League play-off round]] \n|note_res_ELPR=AEK Athens have won the [[2010\u201311 Greek Football Cup]] and are therefore qualified for the playoff round of the 2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League.

Super League Greece]\n}}\n\n==Playoffs==\nIn the play-off for Champions League, the four teams play each other in a home and away [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]]. However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five and rounded to the nearest whole number of points, if necessary, to give the other teams the points with which they start the mini-league.\n\nFifth-placed club Olympiakos Volou earned 47 points during the regular season.

Her hairstyle is shown to have changed 10 years after the defeat of Majin Buu, becoming shorter. She has this same hairstyle in ''Dragon Ball GT''.\n\nAndroid #18 is introduced wearing a denim jacket and skirt, dark blue leggings, brown boots and a black shirt with black and white sleeves.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 13, chapter 155</ref> After arriving at Goku's home, she gains a new outfit, first seen when she is depicted going through his wife Chi-Chi's closet; a white short sleeve shirt underneath a black vest, a pair of blue green jeans, black gloves with a ring on the left arm and black flats with orange socks.

Her attire remains mostly unchanged for the sequel ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|Resurrection 'F']]'' apart from her no longer wearing the necklace and wearing blue boots. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Android 18 is shown with two different outfits. The first is a red long sleeve turtleneck with black pants and red high heels with earrings. The second is a purple blazer with a pink undershirt and matching pants alongside the same red heels and earrings from earlier.\n\n=== Voice actors ===\n[[File:ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg|thumb|Colleen Clinkenbeard was the voice of Android 18 during Meredith McCoy's hiatus.]]\nIn the Japanese version of the entire ''Dragon Ball'' anime series and subsequent related media, Android 18 is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]].\n\nIn English, Android 18 is voiced by [[Meredith McCoy]] in the Funimation dub of ''Dragon Ball Z'' and ''Dragon Ball GT'' except for ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'', where she is voiced by [[Colleen Clinkenbeard]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-07/dragon-ball-z-kai-buu-saga-to-air-on-toonami/.109619|title=Dragon Ball Z Kai's Buu Saga to Air on Toonami|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}</ref> However, since ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]],'' Meredith has returned to the role.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-04/dragon-ball-super-new-opening-sequence-previewed-in-screenshots/.111849|title=Dragon Ball Super's New Opening Sequence Previewed in Screenshots|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Abilities ===\nFollowing her conversion into a cyborg, Android 18 possesses superhuman strength, durability, speed and reflexes.<ref name=chapter159>''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 159</ref> She also has the ability to fly.<ref name=chapter157>''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 157</ref> Thanks to her conversion into a cyborg, she has eternal youth and unlike the other characters in the series, has energy that is not detectable with ''Ki Sense'',  which causes them to not be directly found using the standard method of identifying a warrior and their strength.\n\nIn regards to her strength, upon her introduction, the main timeline version of Android 18 is shown to be able to defeat Vegeta and Trunks in their Super Saiyan forms, Piccolo and Tenshinhan, Trunks stating afterward that she is stronger than her counterpart in his timeline. This effectively makes her one of the stronger characters in the series at the time, Android 17 being said to be slightly stronger and Android 16 having more strength than both of them. Regardless, she still can easily overwhelm all of the heroes, as can her alternate timeline counterpart. However, her advantage in strength falters by the time she encounters Cell who in his first form, after absorbing a large portion of the human population and effectively increasing his power, fights on par with Android 16 and easily subdues both him and Android 18 in his second form. By the time seven years pass after Cell's defeat, Android 18 is now outclassed by Gohan, Vegeta and Piccolo, though still is stronger than the other characters. Since then, Android 18 has been easily bested by Boo and Beerus, though still is one of the most powerful characters on Earth.\n\nShe is capable of using the {{nihongo|''Power Blitz''|\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Paw\u0101 Burittsu}}, a sphere energy wave she fires after drawing back her hand which is either pink or blue in color as well as a rapid-fire variation called {{nihongo|''Infiniti Bullet''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Infiniti Barrette}}.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 420</ref> Android 18 also possess {{nihongo|High-Pressure Energy Wave|\u9ad8\u5727\u7e2e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6ce2|Koasshuku Enerug\u012b-Ha}}.

They are identical in appearance to the versions of the two in the present timeline, Android 18 wearing the ensemble she wore in the main timeline upon her activation by Dr. Gero. Within the months of their release, shortly after the death of Goku, they kill their timeline's versions of Piccolo, Vegeta, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien and Yajirobe, Gohan managing to escape. Several years later, they kill Gohan and then nearly kill Trunks three years later when he confronts the pair during one of their killing sprees. When Trunks returns from the past, now vastly stronger than he was in their previous encounter as a result of his training, she shows interest in finally ending his life after he confronts her and Android 17, but is killed by him instead.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 225</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Free the Future|number=194|series=Dragon Ball Z|date=July 21, 1993}}</ref>\n\nSeven years later, she has married Krillin and has a daughter with him named {{nihongo4|Marron|\u30de\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3|M\u0101ron}}.

Her attire remains mostly unchanged for the sequel ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|Resurrection 'F']]'' apart from her no longer wearing the necklace and wearing blue boots. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Android 18 is shown with two different outfits. The first is a red long sleeve turtleneck with black pants and red high heels with earrings. The second is a purple blazer with a pink undershirt and matching pants alongside the same red heels and earrings from earlier.\n\n=== Voice actors ===\n[[File:ColleenClinkenbeardHeadshot.jpg|thumb|Colleen Clinkenbeard was the voice of Android 18 during Meredith McCoy's hiatus.]]\nIn the Japanese version of the entire ''Dragon Ball'' anime series and subsequent related media, Android 18 is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]].\n\nIn English, Android 18 is voiced by [[Meredith McCoy]] in the Funimation dub of ''Dragon Ball Z'' and ''Dragon Ball GT'' except for ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'', where she is voiced by [[Colleen Clinkenbeard]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-07/dragon-ball-z-kai-buu-saga-to-air-on-toonami/.109619|title=Dragon Ball Z Kai's Buu Saga to Air on Toonami|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}</ref> However, since ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]],'' Meredith has returned to the role.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-04/dragon-ball-super-new-opening-sequence-previewed-in-screenshots/.111849|title=Dragon Ball Super's New Opening Sequence Previewed in Screenshots|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Abilities ===\nFollowing her conversion into a cyborg, Android 18 possesses superhuman strength, durability, speed and reflexes.<ref name=chapter159>''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 159</ref> She also has the ability to fly.<ref name=chapter157>''Dragon Ball Z'', volume 13, chapter 157</ref> Thanks to her conversion into a cyborg, she has eternal youth and unlike the other characters in the series, has energy that is not detectable with ''Ki Sense'',  which causes them to not be directly found using the standard method of identifying a warrior and their strength.\n\nIn regards to her strength, upon her introduction, the main timeline version of Android 18 is shown to be able to defeat Vegeta and Trunks in their Super Saiyan forms, Piccolo and Tenshinhan, Trunks stating afterward that she is stronger than her counterpart in his timeline. This effectively makes her one of the stronger characters in the series at the time, Android 17 being said to be slightly stronger and Android 16 having more strength than both of them. Regardless, she still can easily overwhelm all of the heroes, as can her alternate timeline counterpart. However, her advantage in strength falters by the time she encounters Cell who in his first form, after absorbing a large portion of the human population and effectively increasing his power, fights on par with Android 16 and easily subdues both him and Android 18 in his second form. By the time seven years pass after Cell's defeat, Android 18 is now outclassed by Gohan, Vegeta and Piccolo, though still is stronger than the other characters. Since then, Android 18 has been easily bested by Boo and Beerus, though still is one of the most powerful characters on Earth.\n\nShe is capable of using the {{nihongo|''Power Blitz''|\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Paw\u0101 Burittsu}}, a sphere energy wave she fires after drawing back her hand which is either pink or blue in color as well as a rapid-fire variation called {{nihongo|''Infiniti Bullet''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Infiniti Barrette}}.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 420</ref> Android 18 also possess {{nihongo|High-Pressure Energy Wave|\u9ad8\u5727\u7e2e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6ce2|Koasshuku Enerug\u012b-Ha}}.

Within the months of their release, shortly after the death of Goku, they kill their timeline's versions of Piccolo, Vegeta, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien and Yajirobe, Gohan managing to escape. Several years later, they kill Gohan and then nearly kill Trunks three years later when he confronts the pair during one of their killing sprees.

However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five.\n\nBefore the last round of matches, fifth-placed club AEK Athens earned 48 points during the regular season. Based on this number and the calculations above, Panathinaikos as runners-up began the playoffs with four points ((66\u201348)/5 = 3.6, rounded to 4) while P.A.O.K. and Atromitos started with zero points each ((50\u201348)/5 = 0.4, rounded to 0).\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|section=Play-offs\n|show_limit = 5\n|res_col_header=Q\n|highest_pos=2\n<!--\nadjust_points parameter denotes starting points for the first three teams\n-->\n\n|team2=PAT|team3=AEK|team4=ATR|team5=PAOK\n\n|win_PAT=3|draw_PAT=1|loss_PAT=2|gf_PAT=5|ga_PAT=4|adjust_points_PAT=4\n|win_AEK=3|draw_AEK=0|loss_AEK=3|gf_AEK=7|ga_AEK=5|adjust_points_AEK=0\n|win_ATR=2|draw_ATR=2|loss_ATR=2|gf_ATR=6|ga_ATR=6|adjust_points_ATR=0\n|win_PAOK=2|draw_PAOK=1|loss_PAOK=3|gf_PAOK=3|ga_PAOK=6|adjust_points_PAOK=0\n\n|col_CL3=green2|text_CL3=Qualification for [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]]\n|result2=CL3\n|col_INEC=inherit|text_INEC=Ineligible for 2012\u201313 European competitions.{{efn|name=AEK|AEK Athens was not licensed to play in the Europa League 2012\u20132013 and therefore was replaced by the 6th placed team in the league table, Asteras Tripoli, qualified for the second qualifying round.

Super League Greece] {{in lang|el}}\n}}\n\n==Playoffs==\nIn the play-off for Champions League, the four qualified teams play each other in a home and away [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]]. However, they do not all start with 0 points. Instead, a weighting system applies to the teams' standing at the start of the play-off mini-league. The team finishing fifth in the Super League will start the play-off with 0 points. The fifth placed team's end of season tally of points is subtracted from the sum of the points that other teams have. This number is then divided by five.\n\nBefore the last round of matches, fifth-placed club AEK Athens earned 48 points during the regular season. Based on this number and the calculations above, Panathinaikos as runners-up began the playoffs with four points ((66\u201348)/5 = 3.6, rounded to 4) while P.A.O.K. and Atromitos started with zero points each ((50\u201348)/5 = 0.4, rounded to 0).\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|section=Play-offs\n|show_limit = 5\n|res_col_header=Q\n|highest_pos=2\n<!--\nadjust_points parameter denotes starting points for the first three teams\n-->\n\n|team2=PAT|team3=AEK|team4=ATR|team5=PAOK\n\n|win_PAT=3|draw_PAT=1|loss_PAT=2|gf_PAT=5|ga_PAT=4|adjust_points_PAT=4\n|win_AEK=3|draw_AEK=0|loss_AEK=3|gf_AEK=7|ga_AEK=5|adjust_points_AEK=0\n|win_ATR=2|draw_ATR=2|loss_ATR=2|gf_ATR=6|ga_ATR=6|adjust_points_ATR=0\n|win_PAOK=2|draw_PAOK=1|loss_PAOK=3|gf_PAOK=3|ga_PAOK=6|adjust_points_PAOK=0\n\n|col_CL3=green2|text_CL3=Qualification for [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]]\n|result2=CL3\n|col_INEC=inherit|text_INEC=Ineligible for 2012\u201313 European competitions.{{efn|name=AEK|AEK Athens was not licensed to play in the Europa League 2012\u20132013 and therefore was replaced by the 6th placed team in the league table, Asteras Tripoli, qualified for the second qualifying round.

A spin-off of the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'', it was first announced in May 2019, and is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[iPadOS]]. The game is [[free-to-play]], and was first released in [[early access]] in October 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSimilar to ''Minecraft'', ''Minecraft Earth'' is centered around building structures, gathering resources, crafting, and exploration. The game utilizes the same [[Bedrock game engine]] as other versions of ''Minecraft''. In \"build mode\", players can build augmented reality structures on \"Buildplates\" in collaboration with other players, then explore them in full size with \"play mode\". In both Build mode and Play mode, the buildplates are overlayed onto the real world using [[augmented reality]] (AR) and the built-in phone camera. Players can gather resources by collecting \"tappables\" in the in-game map and by completing \"adventures\" which may be a puzzle, a specific task, or a virtual location with hostile entities to defeat. ''Minecraft Earth'' takes into account physical objects such as trees and lakes so there are fewer incidents and interferences with the AR simulation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3396137/minecraft-earth-mobile-ar-microsoft.html |title=Minecraft Earth busts out of the box as a Pokemon Go-inspired mobile AR game |date=17 May 2019 |work=PCWorld |access-date=17 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Minecraft Earth'' includes many different kinds of in-game entities called \"mobs\" that are exclusive variations of the mobs in ''Minecraft''. The game has two in-game currencies: \"rubies\" and \"minecoins\". Rubies can be earned through gameplay or purchased with real money, and can be used to purchase items that affect gameplay such as \"build plates\".<ref>{{Cite web

published by [[Xbox Game Studios]]. A spin-off of the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'', it was first announced in May 2019, and is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[iPadOS]]. The game is [[free-to-play]], and was first released in [[early access]] in October 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSimilar to ''Minecraft'', ''Minecraft Earth'' is centered around building structures, gathering resources, crafting, and exploration. The game utilizes the same [[Bedrock game engine]] as other versions of ''Minecraft''. In \"build mode\", players can build augmented reality structures on \"Buildplates\" in collaboration with other players, then explore them in full size with \"play mode\". In both Build mode and Play mode, the buildplates are overlayed onto the real world using [[augmented reality]] (AR) and the built-in phone camera. Players can gather resources by collecting \"tappables\" in the in-game map and by completing \"adventures\" which may be a puzzle, a specific task, or a virtual location with hostile entities to defeat. ''Minecraft Earth'' takes into account physical objects such as trees and lakes so there are fewer incidents and interferences with the AR simulation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3396137/minecraft-earth-mobile-ar-microsoft.html |title=Minecraft Earth busts out of the box as a Pokemon Go-inspired mobile AR game |date=17 May 2019 |work=PCWorld |access-date=17 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Minecraft Earth'' includes many different kinds of in-game entities called \"mobs\" that are exclusive variations of the mobs in ''Minecraft''. The game has two in-game currencies: \"rubies\" and \"minecoins\". Rubies can be earned through gameplay or purchased with real money, and can be used to purchase items that affect gameplay such as \"build plates\".<ref>{{Cite web

During his teenage years he worked briefly as a [[Male prostitution|rent-boy]]. He then spent 30 years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style. His one-man stage show was a long-running hit both in Britain and America and he also appeared in films and on TV. Crisp defied convention by criticising both [[gay liberation]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n'''Denis Charles Pratt''' was born in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], South London, on [[Christmas Day]] 1908, the fourth child of solicitor Spencer Charles Pratt (1871\u20131931) and former [[governess]] Frances Marion Pratt (n\u00e9e Phillips; 1873\u20131960).<ref>1911 Census for England and Wales, The National Archives (findmypast.co.uk): RG number: RG14; Piece: 2929; Reference: RG14PN2929, RG78PN101; Registration District: Epsom; Sub District: Carshalton; Enumeration District: 7; Parish: Carshalton; Address: Wolverton, Egmont Road, Sutton; County: Surrey.</ref> His elder siblings were Katherine (1901\u20131976), Gerald (1902\u20131983) and Lewis (1907\u20131968). He changed his name to '''Quentin Crisp''' in his twenties after leaving home and expressed a feminine appearance to a degree that shocked contemporary Londoners and provoked [[Homophobia|homophobic]] attacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy his own account, Crisp was \u2018effeminate\u2019 in his demeanour from an early age resulting in him being teased while at [[Kingswood House School]]<ref name=\"qandp\">{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=Andrew |title=Quentin and Philip |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-78051-0 |pages=}}</ref> in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], from which he won a scholarship to [[Denstone College]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]], in 1922. After leaving school in 1926, Crisp studied journalism at [[King's College London]], but failed to graduate in 1928, going on to take art classes at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].\n\nAround this time, Crisp began visiting the caf\u00e9s of [[Soho]] \u2013 his favourite being The Black Cat in [[Old Compton Street]] \u2013 meeting other young gay men and [[Male prostitution|rent-boys]], and experimenting with make-up and [[transvestism|women's clothes]]. For six months he worked as a prostitute;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/211644.stm \"Crisp: The naked civil servant\"], BBC News, November twenty-first, 1999</ref> in a 1999 interview,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} he said he was looking for love, but found only degradation.\n\nCrisp left home to move to the [[central London|centre of London]] at the end of 1930, and after dwelling in a succession of flats, found a [[Bedsit|bed-sitting]] room in Denbigh Street, [[Pimlico]], where he \"held court with London's brightest and roughest characters.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His \u2018outlandish\u2019 appearance \u2013 he wore bright make-up, dyed his long hair crimson, painted his fingernails and wore sandals to display his painted toe-nails \u2013 brought admiration and curiosity from some quarters, but generally attracted hostility and violence from strangers passing him in the streets.\n\n===Middle years===\nCrisp attempted to join the [[British army]] at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but was rejected and declared exempt by the medical board on the grounds that he was \"suffering from sexual perversion\". He remained in London during [[The Blitz|the 1941 Blitz]], stocked up on cosmetics, purchased five pounds of [[henna]] and paraded through the black-out, picking up [[GI (term)|G.I.s]], whose kindness and open-mindedness inspired his love of all things American.\n\nIn 1940, he moved into a first-floor flat at 129 Beaufort Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a bed-sitting room that he occupied until he emigrated to the United States in 1981. In the intervening years he never attempted any housework, writing famously in his memoir ''The Naked Civil Servant'': \"After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.\"<ref>Crisp, Quentin. ''The Naked Civil Servant''. Penguin Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nCrisp left his job as an [[technical drawing|engineer's tracer]] in 1942 to become a model in [[life class]]es in London and the [[Home Counties]]. He continued posing for artists for the next 30 years.\n\nCrisp had published three short books by the time he came to write ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' at the urging of his agent, [[Donald Carroll]]. Crisp wanted to call it ''I Reign in Hell'', a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven\"), but Carroll insisted on ''The Naked Civil Servant'', an insistence that later gave him pause when he offered the manuscript to [[Tom Maschler]] of Jonathan Cape on the same day that [[Desmond Morris]] delivered ''[[The Naked Ape]]''. The book was published in 1968 to generally good reviews. Subsequently, Crisp was approached by the documentary-maker [[Denis Mitchell (filmmaker)|Denis Mitchell]] to be the subject of a short film in which he was expected to talk about his life, voice his opinions and sit around in his flat filing his nails.\n\n===Fame===\n[[File:QuentinCrisp(Q&A)RossBennettLewisPHOTO.png|thumb|right|Quentin Crisp during a Q&A session for his book and the film ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'']]\nIn 1975, the television version of ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' was broadcast on British and US television, making both actor [[John Hurt]] and Crisp himself into stars. This success launched Crisp in a new direction: that of performer and tutor. He devised a one-man show and began touring the country with it. The first half of the show was an entertaining monologue loosely based on his memoirs, while the second half was a question-and-answer session with Crisp picking the audience's written questions at random and answering them in an amusing manner.\n\nWhen his autobiography was reprinted in 1975, following the success of the television version of ''The Naked Civil Servant'', ''[[Gay News]]'' commented that the book should have been published posthumously (Crisp said that this was their polite way of telling him to drop dead). Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said he had met Crisp in 1974, and alleged that he was not sympathetic to the [[Gay Liberation]] movement of the time. Tatchell said Crisp asked him: \"What do you want liberation from? What is there to be proud of? I don't believe in rights for homosexuals.\"<ref name=\"Tatchell\">Peter Tatchell [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-tatchell-quentin-crisp-was-no-gay-hero-1852122.html \"Quentin Crisp was no gay hero\"], ''The Independent'' 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nBy now, Crisp was a theatre-filling [[raconteur]]: his one-man show sold out the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London in 1978. He then took the show to New York. His first stay in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] coincided with a fire, a robbery, and the death of [[Nancy Spungen]]. Crisp decided to move to New York permanently and set about making arrangements. In 1981, he arrived with few possessions and found a small apartment on East 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n[[File:Quentin Crisp's Signature.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The title page of Crisp's 1981 book, How to Become a Virgin. Mr. Crisp's handwritten dedication for a fan appears beneath the title, and reads: \"To Graham from Quentin Crisp\". The dedication is written in a large, round hand with a circle dotting each I. |Quentin Crisp's handwriting and signature, from a dedication on the title page of ''How To Become A Virgin'' (1981)]]\n\nAs he had done in London, Crisp allowed his telephone number to be listed in the [[telephone directory]] and saw it as his duty to converse with anyone who called him. For the first twenty or so years of owning his own telephone, he habitually answered calls with the phrase: \"Yes, Lord?\" (\"Just in case,\" he once said.) Later on, he changed it to \"Oh yes?\", in a querulous tone of voice. His openness to strangers extended to accepting dinner invitations from almost anyone. Whilst he expected the host would pay for dinner, Crisp did his best to \"sing for his supper\" by regaling his host with wonderful stories and yarns, much as he did in his theatrical performances. Dinner with him was said to be one of the best shows in New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHe continued to perform his one-man show, published books on the importance of contemporary manners as a means of social inclusiveness (as opposed to etiquette, which he claimed is socially exclusive), and supported himself by accepting social invitations, and writing film reviews and columns for UK and US magazines and newspapers. He said that provided one could exist on peanuts and champagne, one could quite easily live by going to every [[cocktail party]], [[premiere]] and first night to which one was invited.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Crisp 1982.jpg|thumb |alt=In this sepia-toned photograph, a straight-faced Quentin Crisp gestures from an ornate, high-backed chair. A large, red handkerchief flops from his jacket pocket. |Quentin Crisp in a performance of his one-person show, ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'', in [[Birmingham]], 1982]]\nCrisp also acted on television and in films. He made his debut as a film actor in the [[Royal College of Art]]'s low-budget production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1976). Crisp played [[Polonius]] in the 65-minute adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, supported by [[Helen Mirren]], who doubled as [[Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]. He subsequently appeared in the 1985 film ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'', which brought him into contact with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who played the lead role of Baron [[Frankenstein]]. Crisp also appeared on the television show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' in the 1987 episode \"First Light\", and as the narrator of director [[Richard Kwietniowski]]'s short film ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol (film)|Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1988), based on the [[The Ballad of Reading Gaol|poem]] by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Four years later, he was cast in a lead role, and got top billing, in the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[Topsy and Bunker: The Cat Killers]]'', playing the door-man of a flea-bag hotel in a run-down neighbourhood, quite like the one he dwelled in. According to director [[Thomas Massengale]], Crisp was a delight to work with.\n\nThe 1990s would prove to be his most prolific decade as an actor, as more and more directors offered him roles. In 1992, he was persuaded by [[Sally Potter]] to play [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''. Although he found the role taxing, he won acclaim for a dignified and touching performance. Crisp next had an uncredited cameo in the 1993 AIDS drama ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]].'' Crisp accepted some other small bit parts and cameos, such as a pageant judge in 1995's ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. Crisp's last role was in an independent film, ''American Mod'' (1999), while his last full-feature film was ''HomoHeights'' (also released as ''Happy Heights'', 1996). He was chosen by [[Channel 4]] to deliver the first ''[[Alternative Christmas message|Alternative Christmas Speech]]'', a counterpoint to the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Christmas speech]], in 1993.\n\n===Last years===\nCrisp remained fiercely independent and unpredictable into old age. He caused controversy and confusion in the gay community by jokingly calling AIDS \"a fad\", and homosexuality \"a terrible disease\".<ref name=\"Tatchell\" /> He was continually in demand from journalists requiring a sound-bite, and throughout the 1990s his commentary was sought on any number of topics.\n\nCrisp was a stern critic of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and her attempts to gain public sympathy following her divorce from [[Prince Charles]]. He stated: \"I always thought Diana was such trash and got what she deserved. She was Lady Diana before she was Princess Diana so she knew the racket. She knew that royal marriages have nothing to do with love. You marry a man and you stand beside him on public occasions and you wave and for that you never have a financial worry until the day you die.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Fountain |first=Tim |authorlink= |title=Resident Alien: Quentin Crisp Explains It All |year=1999 |publisher=Nick Hern Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1 85459 657 8 |page=20}}</ref> Following [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in 1997]], he commented that it was perhaps her \"fast and shallow\" lifestyle that led to her demise: \"She could have been Queen of England \u2013 and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behaviour! Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.\"<ref>''Atlanta Southern Voice'', 1 July 1999</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he was among the many people interviewed for ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', a historical documentary addressing how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In his third volume of memoirs, ''Resident Alien'', published in the same year, Crisp stated that he was close to the end of his life, though he continued to make public appearances, and in June of that year he was one of the guest entertainers at the second [[Pride Scotia#1996|Pride Scotland]] festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1997, Crisp was crowned king of the [[Beaux-Arts Ball]] run by the Beaux Arts Society. He presided alongside Queen Audrey Kargere, Prince George Bettinger and Princess Annette Hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192849/http://beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |archivedate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, he celebrated his ninetieth birthday performing the opening night of his one-man show, ''An Evening with Quentin Crisp'', at The Intar Theatre on Forty-Second Street in New York City (produced by [[John Glines]] of [[The Glines]] organisation).\n\nAt the age of ninety, Crisp came to the realisation that he was a [[trans woman]] rather than a gay man. In ''The Last Word'', published posthumously, Crisp said, \"The only thing in my life I have wanted and didn't get was to be a woman. It will be my life's biggest regret. If the operation had been available and cheap when I was young, say when I was twenty-five or twenty-six, I would have jumped at the chance. My life would have been much simpler as a result\".<ref name=pink>Crisp, Quentin. The Last Word. MB Books LLC, 2018 https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/21/quentin-crisp-reflects-on-trans-identity-in-exclusive-final-autobiography/</ref>\n\n===Death===\nCrisp died of a heart attack in November 1999, nearly one month before his 91st birthday, in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] in [[Manchester]], on the eve of a nationwide revival of his one-man show. A humorous pact he had made with [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] to live to be a century old, with a decade off for good behaviour, proved [[prophecy|prophetic]]. He was cremated with a minimum of ceremony as he had requested, and his ashes were flown back to Phillip Ward in New York.\n\nHe bequeathed his rights in three specific books to his respective collaborators Phillip Ward (for Crisp's final book ''The Last Word'' (and the book ''And One More Thing'') \u2013 formerly titled ''Dusty Answers''), Guy Kettelhack (for ''The Wit and Wisdom of Quentin Crisp'') and John Hofsess (for ''Manners from Heaven''). He then bequeathed all future UK-only income (but not the [[copyright]]s, which belong to Stedman Mays, Mary Tahan and Phillip Ward, and are managed by Ward) from his remaining literary estate (including ''The Naked Civil Servant'') to the two men he considered to have had the greatest influence on his career: Richard Gollner, his long-time agent, and Donald Carroll, a former agent he has worked with.\n\n===Posthumous works===\nIn the two years before her death (1997\u20131999), Crisp had been compiling a work that was to initially be titled ''The Dusty Answers'' with Phillip Ward. Crisp and Ward developed material for this book through many hours of recorded interviews, which was necessary because Crisp had lost the use of her left hand and was unable to use a typewriter or computer. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished for eighteen years after Crisp's death, because Ward found it emotionally difficult to transcribe Crisp's words. A chance meeting with Laurence Watts, who interviewed Ward for ''[[Pink News]]'', led to a partnership that would see them co-edit Crisp's remaining work. \n \nOn 21 November 2017, MB Books published ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'' by Crisp, edited by Ward and Watts. Whereas ''The Naked Civil Servant'' made Crisp famous and ''How To Become A Virgin'' detailed that fame, and her move to and life in New York, ''The Last Word'' was written as a goodbye to the world, with Crisp knowing the end was near. In it she recounts several previously untold stories from her life, walks the reader through her journey from obscurity, and reflects on her philosophy. She also describes the realisation that she was a trans woman and not a gay man.<ref name=pink/>\n \nFinally, on 1 January 2019, MB Books published ''And One More Thing'' by Crisp, a companion book to ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'', again edited by Ward and Watts. This book contains material that the editors believed did not fit into ''The Last Word''. In ''And One More Thing'', Crisp primarily shares her views on other people, their lives and their opinions, from [[Flapper|flapper girls]] to [[Monica Lewinsky]], and from the [[British Royal Family]] to [[Walt Disney]]. Also included is the script for Quentin's Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 1993, the script of her one-person show ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'' and her collected poetry.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Ella Guru, Quentin Crisp.jpg|thumb |alt=This colorful portrait focuses on Crisp's face (under his trademark [[fedora]]), but the viewer can still glimpse a stylish shirt collar.

He had jokingly remarked \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.\" In late 1986, Sting visited Crisp in his apartment and was told over dinner \u2013 and the next three days \u2013 what life had been like for a homosexual man in the largely homophobic Great Britain of the 1920s to the 1960s. Sting was both shocked and fascinated and decided to write the song. It includes the lines:\n\n:It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\n:Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\nSting says, \"Well, it's partly about me and partly about Quentin. Again, I was looking for a metaphor. Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.crisperanto.org/recordings/sting.html MR. STING ON ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK], THE QUENTIN CRISP ARCHIVES: ''Crisperanto.org''. Retrieved on 4 February 2014.</ref>\n\nCrisp was the subject of a photographic portrait by [[Herb Ritts]] and was also chronicled in [[Andy Warhol]]'s diaries.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', singer [[Boy George]] discusses how he had felt an affinity towards Crisp during his childhood, as they faced similar problems as young homosexual people living in homophobic surroundings.\n\nCrisp was the subject of the play ''Resident Alien'', by Tim Fountain, which starred his friend [[Bette Bourne]] in 1999. The play opened at the [[Bush Theatre]] in London and transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 2001 where it won two [[Obie Awards|Obies]] (for performance and design). It went on to win a Herald Angel (Best actor) at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] in 2002; subsequent productions have been seen across the US and Australia. A film of the same name was released by [[David Whitten|Greycat Films]] in 1990.\n\nThe song \"The Ballad of Jack Eric Williams (and Other Three-Named Composers)\" from [[William Finn]]'s song-cycle [[Elegies (musical)|''Elegies'']] refers to Crisp, whilst the 1981 [[Synth-pop|synthpop]] song \"No G.D.M\" by German [[Electropop|electro]] band [[Gina X Performance]] is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2009, a television sequel to ''The Naked Civil Servant'' was broadcast. Entitled ''[[An Englishman in New York (film)|An Englishman in New York]]'', the production documented Crisp's later years in Manhattan. Thirty-four years after his first award-winning performance as Crisp, [[John Hurt]] returned to play him again. Other co-stars included [[Denis O'Hare]] as Phillip Steele (an amalgam character based on Crisp's friends Phillip Ward and Tom Steele), [[Jonathan Tucker]] as artist [[Patrick Angus]], [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Connie Clausen]]. The production was filmed in New York in August 2008 and completed in London in October 2008. The film was directed by British director [[Richard Laxton]], written by Brian Fillis, produced by Amanda Jenks and made its premiere at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] (the Berlin International Film Festival) in early February 2009, before being shown on television later that year.\n\nThat same year, Crisp's great-nephew, academic and film-maker Adrian Goycoolea, premiered a short documentary, ''Uncle Denis?'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisperanto.org/news/UncleDenis.html|title=CRISPERANTO.ORG: The Quentin Crisp Archives ... All Things Quentin Crisp!  -  UNCLE DENIS? - a film by Adrian Goycoolea|website=www.crisperanto.org}}</ref> at the 23rd [[London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival]]. The film uses interviews with family and previously unseen home movie footage. In collaboration with Crisperanto (The Quentin Crisp Archives) curator Philip Ward, Goycoolea also created an installation entitled 'Personal Effects' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|title=MIX NYC - The 23rd NY Queer Experimental Film Festival|website=www.mixnyc.org|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174744/http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the 2010 [[MIX NYC]], [[New York City]], which recreated Crisp's New York apartment using his personal effects and included home video footage.\n\nIn 2013, with curator Ward, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in Manhattan staged a three-month retrospective on Crisp, entitled ''Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp''. The retrospective consisted of free screenings of interviews, one man shows, documentaries and other recorded media.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp |url=http://madmuseum.org/series/ladies-and-gentlemen-mr-quentin-crisp |website=Museum of Arts and Design |publisher=Museum of Arts and Design |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Mark Farrelly's solo performance ''Quentin Crisp: Naked Hope'' debuted at the Edinburgh Festival, before transferring to the [[The Other Palace|St. James's Theatre]] in London and subsequently touring.

During his teenage years he worked briefly as a [[Male prostitution|rent-boy]]. He then spent 30 years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style. His one-man stage show was a long-running hit both in Britain and America and he also appeared in films and on TV.

He changed his name to '''Quentin Crisp''' in his twenties after leaving home and expressed a feminine appearance to a degree that shocked contemporary Londoners and provoked [[Homophobia|homophobic]] attacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy his own account, Crisp was \u2018effeminate\u2019 in his demeanour from an early age resulting in him being teased while at [[Kingswood House School]]<ref name=\"qandp\">{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=Andrew |title=Quentin and Philip |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-78051-0 |pages=}}</ref> in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], from which he won a scholarship to [[Denstone College]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]], in 1922. After leaving school in 1926, Crisp studied journalism at [[King's College London]], but failed to graduate in 1928, going on to take art classes at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].\n\nAround this time, Crisp began visiting the caf\u00e9s of [[Soho]] \u2013 his favourite being The Black Cat in [[Old Compton Street]] \u2013 meeting other young gay men and [[Male prostitution|rent-boys]], and experimenting with make-up and [[transvestism|women's clothes]]. For six months he worked as a prostitute;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/211644.stm \"Crisp: The naked civil servant\"], BBC News, November twenty-first, 1999</ref> in a 1999 interview,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} he said he was looking for love, but found only degradation.\n\nCrisp left home to move to the [[central London|centre of London]] at the end of 1930, and after dwelling in a succession of flats, found a [[Bedsit|bed-sitting]] room in Denbigh Street, [[Pimlico]], where he \"held court with London's brightest and roughest characters.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His \u2018outlandish\u2019 appearance \u2013 he wore bright make-up, dyed his long hair crimson, painted his fingernails and wore sandals to display his painted toe-nails \u2013 brought admiration and curiosity from some quarters, but generally attracted hostility and violence from strangers passing him in the streets.\n\n===Middle years===\nCrisp attempted to join the [[British army]] at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but was rejected and declared exempt by the medical board on the grounds that he was \"suffering from sexual perversion\". He remained in London during [[The Blitz|the 1941 Blitz]], stocked up on cosmetics, purchased five pounds of [[henna]] and paraded through the black-out, picking up [[GI (term)|G.I.s]], whose kindness and open-mindedness inspired his love of all things American.\n\nIn 1940, he moved into a first-floor flat at 129 Beaufort Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a bed-sitting room that he occupied until he emigrated to the United States in 1981. In the intervening years he never attempted any housework, writing famously in his memoir ''The Naked Civil Servant'': \"After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.\"<ref>Crisp, Quentin. ''The Naked Civil Servant''. Penguin Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nCrisp left his job as an [[technical drawing|engineer's tracer]] in 1942 to become a model in [[life class]]es in London and the [[Home Counties]]. He continued posing for artists for the next 30 years.\n\nCrisp had published three short books by the time he came to write ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' at the urging of his agent, [[Donald Carroll]]. Crisp wanted to call it ''I Reign in Hell'', a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven\"), but Carroll insisted on ''The Naked Civil Servant'', an insistence that later gave him pause when he offered the manuscript to [[Tom Maschler]] of Jonathan Cape on the same day that [[Desmond Morris]] delivered ''[[The Naked Ape]]''. The book was published in 1968 to generally good reviews. Subsequently, Crisp was approached by the documentary-maker [[Denis Mitchell (filmmaker)|Denis Mitchell]] to be the subject of a short film in which he was expected to talk about his life, voice his opinions and sit around in his flat filing his nails.\n\n===Fame===\n[[File:QuentinCrisp(Q&A)RossBennettLewisPHOTO.png|thumb|right|Quentin Crisp during a Q&A session for his book and the film ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'']]\nIn 1975, the television version of ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' was broadcast on British and US television, making both actor [[John Hurt]] and Crisp himself into stars. This success launched Crisp in a new direction: that of performer and tutor. He devised a one-man show and began touring the country with it. The first half of the show was an entertaining monologue loosely based on his memoirs, while the second half was a question-and-answer session with Crisp picking the audience's written questions at random and answering them in an amusing manner.\n\nWhen his autobiography was reprinted in 1975, following the success of the television version of ''The Naked Civil Servant'', ''[[Gay News]]'' commented that the book should have been published posthumously (Crisp said that this was their polite way of telling him to drop dead). Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said he had met Crisp in 1974, and alleged that he was not sympathetic to the [[Gay Liberation]] movement of the time. Tatchell said Crisp asked him: \"What do you want liberation from? What is there to be proud of? I don't believe in rights for homosexuals.\"<ref name=\"Tatchell\">Peter Tatchell [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-tatchell-quentin-crisp-was-no-gay-hero-1852122.html \"Quentin Crisp was no gay hero\"], ''The Independent'' 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nBy now, Crisp was a theatre-filling [[raconteur]]: his one-man show sold out the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London in 1978. He then took the show to New York. His first stay in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] coincided with a fire, a robbery, and the death of [[Nancy Spungen]]. Crisp decided to move to New York permanently and set about making arrangements. In 1981, he arrived with few possessions and found a small apartment on East 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n[[File:Quentin Crisp's Signature.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The title page of Crisp's 1981 book, How to Become a Virgin. Mr. Crisp's handwritten dedication for a fan appears beneath the title, and reads: \"To Graham from Quentin Crisp\". The dedication is written in a large, round hand with a circle dotting each I. |Quentin Crisp's handwriting and signature, from a dedication on the title page of ''How To Become A Virgin'' (1981)]]\n\nAs he had done in London, Crisp allowed his telephone number to be listed in the [[telephone directory]] and saw it as his duty to converse with anyone who called him. For the first twenty or so years of owning his own telephone, he habitually answered calls with the phrase: \"Yes, Lord?\" (\"Just in case,\" he once said.) Later on, he changed it to \"Oh yes?\", in a querulous tone of voice. His openness to strangers extended to accepting dinner invitations from almost anyone. Whilst he expected the host would pay for dinner, Crisp did his best to \"sing for his supper\" by regaling his host with wonderful stories and yarns, much as he did in his theatrical performances. Dinner with him was said to be one of the best shows in New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHe continued to perform his one-man show, published books on the importance of contemporary manners as a means of social inclusiveness (as opposed to etiquette, which he claimed is socially exclusive), and supported himself by accepting social invitations, and writing film reviews and columns for UK and US magazines and newspapers. He said that provided one could exist on peanuts and champagne, one could quite easily live by going to every [[cocktail party]], [[premiere]] and first night to which one was invited.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Crisp 1982.jpg|thumb |alt=In this sepia-toned photograph, a straight-faced Quentin Crisp gestures from an ornate, high-backed chair. A large, red handkerchief flops from his jacket pocket. |Quentin Crisp in a performance of his one-person show, ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'', in [[Birmingham]], 1982]]\nCrisp also acted on television and in films. He made his debut as a film actor in the [[Royal College of Art]]'s low-budget production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1976). Crisp played [[Polonius]] in the 65-minute adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, supported by [[Helen Mirren]], who doubled as [[Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]. He subsequently appeared in the 1985 film ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'', which brought him into contact with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who played the lead role of Baron [[Frankenstein]]. Crisp also appeared on the television show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' in the 1987 episode \"First Light\", and as the narrator of director [[Richard Kwietniowski]]'s short film ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol (film)|Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1988), based on the [[The Ballad of Reading Gaol|poem]] by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Four years later, he was cast in a lead role, and got top billing, in the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[Topsy and Bunker: The Cat Killers]]'', playing the door-man of a flea-bag hotel in a run-down neighbourhood, quite like the one he dwelled in. According to director [[Thomas Massengale]], Crisp was a delight to work with.\n\nThe 1990s would prove to be his most prolific decade as an actor, as more and more directors offered him roles. In 1992, he was persuaded by [[Sally Potter]] to play [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''. Although he found the role taxing, he won acclaim for a dignified and touching performance. Crisp next had an uncredited cameo in the 1993 AIDS drama ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]].'' Crisp accepted some other small bit parts and cameos, such as a pageant judge in 1995's ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. Crisp's last role was in an independent film, ''American Mod'' (1999), while his last full-feature film was ''HomoHeights'' (also released as ''Happy Heights'', 1996). He was chosen by [[Channel 4]] to deliver the first ''[[Alternative Christmas message|Alternative Christmas Speech]]'', a counterpoint to the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Christmas speech]], in 1993.\n\n===Last years===\nCrisp remained fiercely independent and unpredictable into old age. He caused controversy and confusion in the gay community by jokingly calling AIDS \"a fad\", and homosexuality \"a terrible disease\".<ref name=\"Tatchell\" /> He was continually in demand from journalists requiring a sound-bite, and throughout the 1990s his commentary was sought on any number of topics.\n\nCrisp was a stern critic of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and her attempts to gain public sympathy following her divorce from [[Prince Charles]]. He stated: \"I always thought Diana was such trash and got what she deserved. She was Lady Diana before she was Princess Diana so she knew the racket. She knew that royal marriages have nothing to do with love. You marry a man and you stand beside him on public occasions and you wave and for that you never have a financial worry until the day you die.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Fountain |first=Tim |authorlink= |title=Resident Alien: Quentin Crisp Explains It All |year=1999 |publisher=Nick Hern Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1 85459 657 8 |page=20}}</ref> Following [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in 1997]], he commented that it was perhaps her \"fast and shallow\" lifestyle that led to her demise: \"She could have been Queen of England \u2013 and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behaviour! Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.\"<ref>''Atlanta Southern Voice'', 1 July 1999</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he was among the many people interviewed for ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', a historical documentary addressing how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In his third volume of memoirs, ''Resident Alien'', published in the same year, Crisp stated that he was close to the end of his life, though he continued to make public appearances, and in June of that year he was one of the guest entertainers at the second [[Pride Scotia#1996|Pride Scotland]] festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1997, Crisp was crowned king of the [[Beaux-Arts Ball]] run by the Beaux Arts Society. He presided alongside Queen Audrey Kargere, Prince George Bettinger and Princess Annette Hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192849/http://beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |archivedate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, he celebrated his ninetieth birthday performing the opening night of his one-man show, ''An Evening with Quentin Crisp'', at The Intar Theatre on Forty-Second Street in New York City (produced by [[John Glines]] of [[The Glines]] organisation).\n\nAt the age of ninety, Crisp came to the realisation that he was a [[trans woman]] rather than a gay man. In ''The Last Word'', published posthumously, Crisp said, \"The only thing in my life I have wanted and didn't get was to be a woman. It will be my life's biggest regret. If the operation had been available and cheap when I was young, say when I was twenty-five or twenty-six, I would have jumped at the chance. My life would have been much simpler as a result\".<ref name=pink>Crisp, Quentin. The Last Word. MB Books LLC, 2018 https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/21/quentin-crisp-reflects-on-trans-identity-in-exclusive-final-autobiography/</ref>\n\n===Death===\nCrisp died of a heart attack in November 1999, nearly one month before his 91st birthday, in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] in [[Manchester]], on the eve of a nationwide revival of his one-man show. A humorous pact he had made with [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] to live to be a century old, with a decade off for good behaviour, proved [[prophecy|prophetic]]. He was cremated with a minimum of ceremony as he had requested, and his ashes were flown back to Phillip Ward in New York.\n\nHe bequeathed his rights in three specific books to his respective collaborators Phillip Ward (for Crisp's final book ''The Last Word'' (and the book ''And One More Thing'') \u2013 formerly titled ''Dusty Answers''), Guy Kettelhack (for ''The Wit and Wisdom of Quentin Crisp'') and John Hofsess (for ''Manners from Heaven''). He then bequeathed all future UK-only income (but not the [[copyright]]s, which belong to Stedman Mays, Mary Tahan and Phillip Ward, and are managed by Ward) from his remaining literary estate (including ''The Naked Civil Servant'') to the two men he considered to have had the greatest influence on his career: Richard Gollner, his long-time agent, and Donald Carroll, a former agent he has worked with.\n\n===Posthumous works===\nIn the two years before his death (1997\u20131999), Crisp had been compiling a work that was to initially be titled ''The Dusty Answers'' with Phillip Ward. Crisp and Ward developed material for this book through many hours of recorded interviews, which was necessary because Crisp had lost the use of his left hand and was unable to use a typewriter or computer. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished for eighteen years after Crisp's death, because Ward found it emotionally difficult to transcribe Crisp's words. A chance meeting with Laurence Watts, who interviewed Ward for ''[[Pink News]]'', led to a partnership that would see them co-edit Crisp's remaining work. \n \nOn 21 November 2017, MB Books published ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'' by Crisp, edited by Ward and Watts. Whereas ''The Naked Civil Servant'' made Crisp famous and ''How To Become A Virgin'' detailed that fame, and his move to and life in New York, ''The Last Word'' was written as a goodbye to the world, with Crisp knowing the end was near. In it he recounts several previously untold stories from his life, walks the reader through his journey from obscurity, and reflects on his philosophy. He also describes the realisation that he was a trans woman and not a gay man.<ref name=pink/>\n \nFinally, on 1 January 2019, MB Books published ''And One More Thing'' by Crisp, a companion book to ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'', again edited by Ward and Watts. This book contains material that the editors believed did not fit into ''The Last Word''. In ''And One More Thing'', Crisp primarily shares his views on other people, their lives and their opinions, from [[Flapper|flapper girls]] to [[Monica Lewinsky]], and from the [[British Royal Family]] to [[Walt Disney]]. Also included is the script for Quentin's Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 1993, the script of his one-man show ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'' and his collected poetry.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Ella Guru, Quentin Crisp.jpg|thumb |alt=This colorful portrait focuses on Crisp's face (under his trademark [[fedora]]), but the viewer can still glimpse a stylish shirt collar.

He had jokingly remarked \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.\" In late 1986, Sting visited Crisp in his apartment and was told over dinner \u2013 and the next three days \u2013 what life had been like for a homosexual man in the largely homophobic Great Britain of the 1920s to the 1960s. Sting was both shocked and fascinated and decided to write the song. It includes the lines:\n\n:It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\n:Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\nSting says, \"Well, it's partly about me and partly about Quentin. Again, I was looking for a metaphor. Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.crisperanto.org/recordings/sting.html MR. STING ON ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK], THE QUENTIN CRISP ARCHIVES: ''Crisperanto.org''. Retrieved on 4 February 2014.</ref>\n\nCrisp was the subject of a photographic portrait by [[Herb Ritts]] and was also chronicled in [[Andy Warhol]]'s diaries.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', singer [[Boy George]] discusses how he had felt an affinity towards Crisp during his childhood, as they faced similar problems as young homosexual people living in homophobic surroundings.\n\nCrisp was the subject of the play ''Resident Alien'', by Tim Fountain, which starred his friend [[Bette Bourne]] in 1999. The play opened at the [[Bush Theatre]] in London and transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 2001 where it won two [[Obie Awards|Obies]] (for performance and design). It went on to win a Herald Angel (Best actor) at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] in 2002; subsequent productions have been seen across the US and Australia. A film of the same name was released by [[David Whitten|Greycat Films]] in 1990.\n\nThe song \"The Ballad of Jack Eric Williams (and Other Three-Named Composers)\" from [[William Finn]]'s song-cycle [[Elegies (musical)|''Elegies'']] refers to Crisp, whilst the 1981 [[Synth-pop|synthpop]] song \"No G.D.M\" by German [[Electropop|electro]] band [[Gina X Performance]] is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2009, a television sequel to ''The Naked Civil Servant'' was broadcast. Entitled ''[[An Englishman in New York (film)|An Englishman in New York]]'', the production documented Crisp's later years in Manhattan. Thirty-four years after his first award-winning performance as Crisp, [[John Hurt]] returned to play him again. Other co-stars included [[Denis O'Hare]] as Phillip Steele (an amalgam character based on Crisp's friends Phillip Ward and Tom Steele), [[Jonathan Tucker]] as artist [[Patrick Angus]], [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Connie Clausen]]. The production was filmed in New York in August 2008 and completed in London in October 2008. The film was directed by British director [[Richard Laxton]], written by Brian Fillis, produced by Amanda Jenks and made its premiere at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] (the Berlin International Film Festival) in early February 2009, before being shown on television later that year.\n\nThat same year, Crisp's great-nephew, academic and film-maker Adrian Goycoolea, premiered a short documentary, ''Uncle Denis?'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisperanto.org/news/UncleDenis.html|title=CRISPERANTO.ORG: The Quentin Crisp Archives ...

The film uses interviews with family and previously unseen home movie footage. In collaboration with Crisperanto (The Quentin Crisp Archives) curator Philip Ward, Goycoolea also created an installation entitled 'Personal Effects' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|title=MIX NYC - The 23rd NY Queer Experimental Film Festival|website=www.mixnyc.org|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174744/http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the 2010 [[MIX NYC]], [[New York City]], which recreated Crisp's New York apartment using his personal effects and included home video footage.\n\nIn 2013, with curator Ward, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in Manhattan staged a three-month retrospective on Crisp, entitled ''Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp''.

Ambel was part of the [[Comte de Provence]] but was liberated in the year 973, then was part of [[County of Forcalquier|Forcalquier]] in 1054, then [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 1209.

Peter had, by concession from the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], high, middle, and low jurisdiction rights over Ambel. The lordship was transmitted through four generations of the Ambel family until the death of Raymond III around 1445. His eldest son Stephen had died ten years earlier and Raymond left only daughters; the [[Salic law]] did not apply to dauphinoise land  so the eldest, Burguette, became Lady Ambel and her husband, Raymond de la Villette was Lord \"of his wife's head\" until his death.

Ardradus, son of Bysardon, had a son Eldrade (781-844?) who became a monk and gave up all his rights to [[Novalesa Abbey]] in [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]].\n\nThe [[Saracens]] destroyed everything in the early years of the 10th century. Ambel was part of the [[Comte de Provence]] but was liberated in the year 973, then was part of [[County of Forcalquier|Forcalquier]] in 1054, then [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 1209. When creating the [[Castellany]] in 1250, Ambel was part of [[Corps]].<ref name=\"Gueydan1\">Jean Gueydan, ''The Lords of Beaumont'', ed.

Peter had, by concession from the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], high, middle, and low jurisdiction rights over Ambel. The lordship was transmitted through four generations of the Ambel family until the death of Raymond III around 1445. His eldest son Stephen had died ten years earlier and Raymond left only daughters; the [[Salic law]] did not apply to dauphinoise land  so the eldest, Burguette, became Lady Ambel and her husband, Raymond de la Villette was Lord \"of his wife's head\" until his death.
