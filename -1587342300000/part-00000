After [[World War II]], [[emigration restrictions]] were imposed by countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]], which consisted of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state]]s in Central and Eastern Europe. Legal [[emigration]] was in most cases only possible in order to reunite families or to allow members of minority ethnic groups to return to their homelands.\n\nEastern Bloc governments argued that strict limits to emigration were necessary to prevent a [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection#\"Brain drain\"|brain drain]]. The United States and Western European governments argued that they represented a violation of human rights. Despite the restrictions, [[defection]]s to the West occurred.\n\nAfter [[East Germany]] tightened its zonal occupation border with [[West Germany]], the city sector border between [[East Berlin]] and [[West Berlin]] became a loophole through which defection could occur. This was closed with the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August 1961. Thereafter, emigration from the [[Eastern Bloc]] was effectively limited to illegal defections, ethnic emigration under bilateral agreements, and a small number of other cases.\n\n==Background ==\n===Creation of the Eastern Bloc===\n{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}\n[[File:EasternBlocAfter.svg|right|thumb|300px|Map of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in Central Europe]]\n[[Bolsheviks]] took power in Russia following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].  During the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, coinciding with the [[Red Army]]'s entry into [[Minsk]] in 1919, Belarus was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]]. After more conflict, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was declared in 1920.  With the defeat of [[Ukraine]] in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], after the March 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] following the [[Polish-Soviet War]], central and eastern Ukraine were annexed into the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1922, the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Ukraine SSR]],  [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|officially merged]] as republics creating the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], or [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring the final stages of World War II, the [[Soviet Union]] began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by directly annexing several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were originally effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].\n\nThese included Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|three different SSRs]]),<ref name=\"stalinswars43\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}</ref> [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),<ref name=\"wettig20\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}</ref><ref name=\"senn\">Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}</ref> [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),<ref name=\"wettig20\"/><ref name=\"senn\"/> [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),<ref name=\"wettig20\"/><ref name=\"senn\"/> part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]], and later merged into the [[Russian SFSR]])<ref name=\"ckpipe\">Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York : Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}</ref> and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).<ref name=\"stalinswars55\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}</ref><ref name=\"shirer794\">{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}</ref> By 1945, these additional annexed countries totaled approximately 465,000 additional square kilometers (180,000 square miles), or slightly more than the area of West Germany, East Germany and Austria combined.<ref name=\"graubard150\">{{Harvnb|Graubard|1991|p=150}}</ref>\n\nOther states were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],<ref name=\"granville\">Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}</ref> the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370\u201371}}</ref> the [[People's Republic of Romania]], the [[People's Republic of Albania]],<ref name=\"cook17\">{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}</ref> and later [[East Germany]] from the Soviet zone of German occupation.<ref name=\"wettig96\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96\u2013100}}</ref>  The [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] was also considered part of the Bloc,<ref name=\"crampton216\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=216\u20137}}</ref><ref>''Eastern bloc'', ''The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition.

1986]]\n{{Further|Eastern Bloc|Eastern Bloc information dissemination|Eastern Bloc politics|Eastern Bloc economies}}\nThroughout the Eastern Bloc, both in the Soviet Union and the rest of the Bloc, the Russian SFSR was given prominence, and referred to as the ''naibolee vydaju\u0161\u010dajasja nacija'' (the most prominent nation) and the   ''rukovodja\u0161\u010dij narod'' (the leading people).<ref name=\"graubard150\"/> The Soviets promoted the reverence of Russian actions and characteristics, and the construction of Soviet Communist structural hierarchies in the other countries of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"graubard150\"/>\n\nThe defining characteristic of communism implemented in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.<ref name=\"hardt11\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}</ref>  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed \"[[bourgeois democracy]]\" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.<ref name=\"hardt12\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}</ref> The Soviets mandated expropriation and  ''estatization'' of private property.<ref name=\"roht83\">{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet-style \"replica regimes\" that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced the Soviet [[command economy]], but also adopted the brutal methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.<ref name=\"roht83\"/>  Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc saw even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the bases underlying Communist power therein.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}</ref> The suppression of dissidence and opposition was a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power within the Eastern Bloc, though the degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and time throughout the Bloc.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>\n\nIn addition, media in the Eastern Bloc served as an organ of the state, completely reliant on, and subservient to, the ruling Communist parties, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the ruling Communist party.<ref name=\"oneil15\">{{Citation|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick|title=Post-communism and the Media in Eastern Europe|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0-7146-4765-9|pages=15\u201325}}</ref> Furthermore, the Eastern Bloc experienced economic mis-development by central planners resulting in those countries following a path of [[Extensive growth|extensive]] rather than intensive development, and lagged far behind their western European counterparts in per capita Gross Domestic Product.<ref name=\"hardt15\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|pp=15\u201317}}</ref>  Empty shelves in shops even in East Germany

restrictions in the USSR===\n[[File:Soviet Exit Visa Forever.jpg|right|thumb|Rare Soviet \"type 2\" visa for permanent emigration]]\n{{Further|Soviet Border Troops|Refusenik|Passport system in the Soviet Union}}\nAlthough the first program of the Bolshevik movement in Russia included a demand for the \"abolition of passports\",<ref name=\"dowty67\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=67}}</ref> just two months after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the new regime instituted passport controls and forbade the exit of belligerent nationals.<ref name=\"dowty68\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=68}}</ref>  The reasoning was partly that emigration was conflated with opposition to the socialist state and also the fear that emigration would inflate opposition armies.<ref name=\"dowty68\"/>  The 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] obligated Russia to allow emigration of non-Russians who wanted German citizenship, but the regime attempted to reduce this flow by allowing it during only one month.<ref name=\"dowty68\"/>  Beginning in 1919, travel abroad required the approval of the [[NKVD]], with the additional consent of the Special Department of the [[Cheka]] added in 1920.<ref name=\"dowty68\"/>  In 1922, after the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]], both the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Russian SFSR]] issued general rules for travel that foreclosed virtually all departures, making legal emigration all but impossible.<ref name=\"dowty69\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=69}}</ref>  However, the Soviet Union could not control its borders until a system of border guards was created through a special corps of the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie]] (GPU), such that by 1928, even illegal departure was all but impossible.<ref name=\"dowty69\"/>\n\nIn 1929, even more strict controls were introduced, decreeing that any Soviet official serving abroad who went over \"to the camp of the enemies of the working class and the peasants\" and refused to return would be executed within twenty-four hours of being apprehended.<ref name=\"dowty70\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=70}}</ref>  In 1932, as Stalin's first [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] forced collectivization, to allocate scarce housing and weed out \"nonproductive\" elements, [[Passport system in the Soviet Union|internal passport controls were introduced]].<ref name=\"dowty70\"/> When combined with individual city [[Propiska in the Soviet Union|Propiska]] (\"place of residence\") permits, and internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the [[101st kilometre]], these rules greatly restricted mobility within even small areas.<ref name=\"dowty70\"/>  When the Soviet Constitution of 1936 was promulgated, virtually no legal emigration took place, except for very limited family reunification and some forced deportations.<ref name=\"dowty70\"/>  Very small numbers snuck into [[Romania]], [[Persia]], and [[Manchuria]], but the bulk of the population remained essentially captive.<ref name=\"dowty71\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=71}}</ref> ''[[Moskovskaya Pravda]]'' later described the decision to emigrate as \"unnatural and like burying someone alive.\"<ref name=\"dowty74\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=74}}</ref>  Those wishing to leave were viewed not just as deserters, but traitors.<ref name=\"dowty74\"/>\n\nThe mobilization of labor in the Soviet Union was not feasible if emigration remained an option with the relative low standard of living that existed at that time.<ref name=\"dowty73\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=73}}</ref>  Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later stated \"We were scared, really scared.  We were afraid the thaw might unleash a flood, which we wouldn't be able to control and which could drown us.  How could it drown us?  It could have overflowed the banks of the Soviet riverbed and formed a tidal wave that which would have washed away all the barriers and retaining walls of our society.\"<ref name=\"dowty74\"/>\n\nIn addition, emigration restrictions were used to keep secrecy about life in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"laqueur23\"/>  Starting in 1935, [[Joseph Stalin]] had already effectively sealed off outside access to the Soviet Socialist Republics ( and until his death in 1953 ), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.<ref name=\"laqueur22\">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}</ref> During this period, and until the late 1970s, 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents that were permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, while their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations, and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.<ref name=\"laqueur22\"/>  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.<ref name=\"laqueur23\">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}</ref> For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrested or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.<ref name=\"laqueur23\"/>\n\n===Fleeing and expelled ethnic Germans in the Eastern Bloc===\n[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sudeten Germans]] expelled after World War II]]\n{{Main|Expulsion of Germans after World War II|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)}}\nAt the end of, and following World War II, at least twelve million ethnic German [[Volksdeutsche]] or [[Reichsdeutsche]] fled or were expelled,<ref name=Weber2>J\u00fcrgen Weber, Germany, 1945\u20131990: A Parallel History, Central European University Press, 2004, p.2, {{ISBN|963-9241-70-9}}</ref><ref name=Kacowicz100/><ref name=Schuck156>Peter H.

Emigration increased following liberalizations passed in 1986.<ref name=marshall/>{{rp|9}} For example, the flow of ethnic Germans from the Eastern Bloc dramatically increased from 42,786 per year in 1986 to 202,673 in 1988.<ref name=marshall/>{{rp|9}} The Soviet Union was facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology.  Subsidies to foreign client states further strained the moribund Soviet economy.\n\nThe first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). Though glasnost advocated openness and political criticism, at the time, it was only permitted in accordance with the political views of the ruling powers. The general public in the [[Eastern bloc]] were still threatened by [[secret police]] and political repression.\n\nBelieving Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, orthodox Communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]'s [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]'s [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]], and [[Socialist Republic of Romania]]\u2019s [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm Romania \u2013 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe], ''U.S. Library of Congress''</ref> \"When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too,\" declared one East German politburo member.<ref name=\"Steele\">Steele, Jonathan.

Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, but major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1988.\n\nIn August 1989, the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] [[Removal of Hungary's border fence|removed its physical border restrictions]] with Austria. The next month, more than 13,000 East German tourists in Hungary escaped to Austria, while Hungary prevented a larger number of East Germans from crossing the border, returning them to Budapest.  The [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany]] ({{lang-de|Montagsdemonstrationen}}) began, with [[East Germany|East German]] protesters demanding rights such as the freedom to travel to foreign countries and to elect a [[democratic government]].  With regard to East Germans demanding emigration rights in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]],  West German Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] negotiated an agreement that allowed them to travel to the West, in trains that had to pass first through East Germany.  When the trains passed [[Dresden]] central station in early October, police forces had to stop people from trying to jump on the trains.\n\nBy 9 October 1989, just after the celebrations for the 40th anniversary of East Germany thousands of protesters gathered, what had begun as a few hundred gatherers at the Nikolai Church in [[East Berlin]] chanting \"Wir sind das Volk!\" (\"We are the people!\"). Although some demonstrators were arrested, the threat of large-scale intervention by security forces never materialized, with [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] leader Helmut Hackenberg and others not receiving precise orders for such action from a surprised East Berlin.  These were followed by even larger protests exceeding 300,000 the next week. East German leader [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]] remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive. Faced with ongoing and increasing civil unrest, the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) deposed Honecker in mid-October, and replaced him with [[Egon Krenz]].\n\nA wave of refugees left East Germany for the West through Czechoslovakia, which was tolerated by the new Krenz government and in agreement with the Czechoslovak government. In order to ease the complications, the Krenz-led Politburo had decided on 9 November to allow East Germans to travel directly to West Berlin the next day. However the [[G\u00fcnter Schabowski|government spokesman]] misstated the news and stated that East Germans could leave for the West effective immediately. As rumors spread, before the regulations were to go effect, on the night of 9 November, tens of thousands of Eastern Berliners flooded [[Checkpoint Charlie]] and other checkpoints along the wall, crossing into West Berlin.  The surprised and overwhelmed border guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors, but it became clear that there was no one among the East German authorities who would dare to take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so there was no way for the vastly outnumbered soldiers to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Therefore, the border checkpoints were opened, although it is disputed [[Harald J\u00e4ger|who was the first to issue the order]].\n\nIn the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], following the suppression of a student protest in [[Prague]], increasing protests swelled to an estimated half-million Czechs and Slovaks demanding freedoms. A two-hour [[general strike]], involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was held on 27 November 1989. [[Barbed wire]] and other obstructions were removed from the border with [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]] in early December. The next day, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] announced that it would relinquish power and dismantle the [[one-party state]]. On 10 December, President [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned, in what was called the [[Velvet Revolution]].\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], on 10 November 1989 \u2014 the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall \u2014 Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo and replaced with [[Petar Mladenov]]. In February 1990 the Party voluntarily gave up its claim on power and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the moderate wing of the Communist Party, renamed the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]].\n\nUnlike other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] had never undergone even a limited [[de-Stalinization]]. In November 1989, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu|Ceau\u015fescu]], then aged 71, was re-elected for another five years as leader of the Romanian Communist Party, signaling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe. As Ceau\u015fescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, on 16 December 1989, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian-speaking Calvinist minister, [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]], for sermons offending the regime.\n\nRioting followed the arrest. Returning from Iran, Ceau\u015fescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest. However, to his shock, the crowd booed as he spoke. Mass protests followed, with about 100,000 protesters occupying [[Opera Square (Bucharest)|Operei Square]] chanting anti-government protests: \"Noi suntem poporul!\" (\"We are the people!\"), \"Armata e cu noi!\" (\"The army is on our side!\"), \"Nu v\u0103 fie fric\u0103, Ceau\u015fescu pic\u0103!\" (\"Have no fear, Ceau\u015fescu will fall\").  The Romanian military changed sides, turning on  Ceau\u015fescu, who was executed after a brief trial three days later.\n\nIn the [[Albania|People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\n\nTechnically the Berlin Wall remained guarded for some time after 9 November though at a decreasing intensity. On 13 June 1990, the official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military began in Bernauer Stra\u00dfe. On 1 July, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that. That month, the final obstacle to German reunification was removed when West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Soviet Empire]]\n*[[Soviet occupations]]\n*[[Post-Soviet states]]\n*[[Iron Curtain]]\n*[[Western world]]\n*[[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n*[[List of Soviet and Eastern Bloc defectors]]\n*[[North Korean defectors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{Citation|last1=Black|first1=Cyril E.|last2=English|first2=Robert D.|last3=Helmreich|first3=Jonathan E.|last4=McAdams|first4=James A.|title=Rebirth: A Political History of Europe since World War II|publisher=Westview Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8133-3664-3}}\n*{{Citation|last=B\u00f6cker|first=Anita|title=Regulation of Migration: International Experiences|publisher=Het Spinhuis|year=1998|isbn=90-5589-095-2}}\n*{{Citation|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2001|isbn=0-8153-4057-5}}\n*{{Citation|last=Crampton|first=R.

After [[World War II]], [[emigration restrictions]] were imposed by countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]], which consisted of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state]]s in Central and Eastern Europe. Legal [[emigration]] was in most cases only possible in order to reunite families or to allow members of minority ethnic groups to return to their homelands.\n\nEastern Bloc governments argued that strict limits to emigration were necessary to prevent a [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection#\"Brain drain\"|brain drain]]. The United States and Western European governments argued that they represented a violation of human rights. Despite the restrictions, [[defection]]s to the West occurred.\n\nAfter [[East Germany]] tightened its zonal occupation border with [[West Germany]], the city sector border between [[East Berlin]] and [[West Berlin]] became a loophole through which defection could occur. This was closed with the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August 1961. Thereafter, emigration from the [[Eastern Bloc]] was effectively limited to illegal defections, ethnic emigration under bilateral agreements, and a small number of other cases.\n\n==Background ==\n===Creation of the Eastern Bloc===\n{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}\n[[File:EasternBlocAfter.svg|right|thumb|300px|Map of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries in Central Europe]]\n[[Bolsheviks]] took power in Russia following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].  During the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, coinciding with the [[Red Army]]'s entry into [[Minsk]] in 1919, Belarus was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]]. After more conflict, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was declared in 1920.  With the defeat of [[Ukraine]] in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], after the March 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] following the [[Polish-Soviet War]], central and eastern Ukraine were annexed into the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1922, the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Ukraine SSR]],  [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|officially merged]] as republics creating the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], or [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring the final stages of World War II, the [[Soviet Union]] began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by directly annexing several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were originally effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].\n\nThese included Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|three different SSRs]]),<ref name=\"stalinswars43\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}</ref> [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),<ref name=\"wettig20\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}</ref><ref name=\"senn\">Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}</ref> [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),<ref name=\"wettig20\"/><ref name=\"senn\"/> [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),<ref name=\"wettig20\"/><ref name=\"senn\"/> part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]], and later merged into the [[Russian SFSR]])<ref name=\"ckpipe\">Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York : Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}</ref> and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).<ref name=\"stalinswars55\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}</ref><ref name=\"shirer794\">{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}</ref> By 1945, these additional annexed countries totaled approximately 465,000 additional square kilometers (180,000 square miles), or slightly more than the area of West Germany, East Germany and Austria combined.<ref name=\"graubard150\">{{Harvnb|Graubard|1991|p=150}}</ref>\n\nOther states were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],<ref name=\"granville\">Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}</ref> the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370\u201371}}</ref> the [[People's Republic of Romania]], the [[People's Republic of Albania]],<ref name=\"cook17\">{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}</ref> and later [[East Germany]] from the Soviet zone of German occupation.<ref name=\"wettig96\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96\u2013100}}</ref>  The [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] was also considered part of the Bloc,<ref name=\"crampton216\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=216\u20137}}</ref><ref>''Eastern bloc'', ''The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition.

months after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the new regime instituted passport controls and forbade the exit of belligerent nationals.<ref name=\"dowty68\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=68}}</ref>  The reasoning was partly that emigration was conflated with opposition to the socialist state and also the fear that emigration would inflate opposition armies.<ref name=\"dowty68\"/>  The 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] obligated Russia to allow emigration of non-Russians who wanted German citizenship, but the regime attempted to reduce this flow by allowing it during only one month.<ref

 In 1922, after the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]], both the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Russian SFSR]] issued general rules for travel that foreclosed virtually all departures, making legal emigration all but impossible.<ref name=\"dowty69\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=69}}</ref>  However, the Soviet Union could not control its borders until a system of border guards was created through a

controls were introduced, decreeing that any Soviet official serving abroad who went over \"to the camp of the enemies of the working class and the peasants\" and refused to return would be executed within twenty-four hours of being apprehended.<ref name=\"dowty70\">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=70}}</ref>  In 1932, as Stalin's first [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five

except for very limited family reunification and some forced deportations.<ref name=\"dowty70\"/>  Very small numbers snuck into [[Romania]], [[Persia]], and [[Manchuria]], but the bulk of the

Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, but major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1988.\n\nIn August 1989, the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] [[Removal of Hungary's border fence|removed its physical border restrictions]] with Austria. The next month, more than 13,000 East German tourists in Hungary escaped to Austria, while Hungary prevented a larger number of East Germans from crossing the border, returning them to Budapest.  The [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany]] ({{lang-de|Montagsdemonstrationen}}) began, with [[East Germany|East German]] protesters demanding rights such as the freedom to travel to foreign countries and to elect a [[democratic government]].  With regard to East Germans demanding emigration rights in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]],  West German Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] negotiated an agreement that allowed them to travel to the West, in trains that had to pass first through East Germany.  When the trains passed [[Dresden]] central station in early October, police forces had to stop people from trying to jump on the trains.\n\nBy 9 October 1989, just after the celebrations for the 40th anniversary of East Germany thousands of protesters gathered, what had begun as a few hundred gatherers at the Nikolai Church in [[East Berlin]] chanting \"Wir sind das Volk!\" (\"We are the people!\"). Although some demonstrators were arrested, the threat of large-scale intervention by security forces never materialized, with [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] leader Helmut Hackenberg and others not receiving precise orders for such action from a surprised East Berlin.  These were followed by even larger protests exceeding 300,000 the next week. East German leader [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]] remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive. Faced with ongoing and increasing civil unrest, the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) deposed Honecker in mid-October, and replaced him with [[Egon Krenz]].\n\nA wave of refugees left East Germany for the West through Czechoslovakia, which was tolerated by the new Krenz government and in agreement with the Czechoslovak government. In order to ease the complications, the Krenz-led Politburo had decided on 9 November to allow East Germans to travel directly to West Berlin the next day. However the [[G\u00fcnter Schabowski|government spokesman]] misstated the news and stated that East Germans could leave for the West effective immediately. As rumors spread, before the regulations were to go effect, on the night of 9 November, tens of thousands of Eastern Berliners flooded [[Checkpoint Charlie]] and other checkpoints along the wall, crossing into West Berlin.  The surprised and overwhelmed border guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors, but it became clear that there was no one among the East German authorities who would dare to take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so there was no way for the vastly outnumbered soldiers to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Therefore, the border checkpoints were opened, although it is disputed [[Harald J\u00e4ger|who was the first to issue the order]].\n\nIn the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], following the suppression of a student protest in [[Prague]], increasing protests swelled to an estimated half-million Czechs and Slovaks demanding freedoms. A two-hour [[general strike]], involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was held on 27 November 1989. [[Barbed wire]] and other obstructions were removed from the border with [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]] in early December. The next day, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] announced that it would relinquish power and dismantle the [[one-party state]]. On 10 December, President [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned, in what was called the [[Velvet Revolution]].\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], on 10 November 1989 \u2014 the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall \u2014 Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo and replaced with [[Petar Mladenov]]. In February 1990 the Party voluntarily gave up its claim on power and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the moderate wing of the Communist Party, renamed the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]].\n\nUnlike other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] had never undergone even a limited [[de-Stalinization]]. In November 1989, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu|Ceau\u015fescu]], then aged 71, was re-elected for another five years as leader of the Romanian Communist Party, signaling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe. As Ceau\u015fescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, on 16 December 1989, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian-speaking Calvinist minister, [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s]], for sermons offending the regime.\n\nRioting followed the arrest. Returning from Iran, Ceau\u015fescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest. However, to his shock, the crowd booed as he spoke. Mass protests followed, with about 100,000 protesters occupying [[Opera Square (Bucharest)|Operei Square]] chanting anti-government protests: \"Noi suntem poporul!\" (\"We are the people!\"), \"Armata e cu noi!\" (\"The army is on our side!\"), \"Nu v\u0103 fie fric\u0103, Ceau\u015fescu pic\u0103!\" (\"Have no fear, Ceau\u015fescu will fall\").  The Romanian military changed sides, turning on  Ceau\u015fescu, who was executed after a brief trial three days later.\n\nIn the [[Albania|People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\n\nTechnically the Berlin Wall remained guarded for some time after 9 November though at a decreasing intensity. On 13 June 1990, the official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military began in Bernauer Stra\u00dfe. On 1 July, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that. That month, the final obstacle to German reunification was removed when West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Soviet Empire]]\n*[[Soviet occupations]]\n*[[Post-Soviet states]]\n*[[Iron Curtain]]\n*[[Western world]]\n*[[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n*[[List of Soviet and Eastern Bloc defectors]]\n*[[North Korean defectors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{Citation|last1=Black|first1=Cyril E.|last2=English|first2=Robert D.|last3=Helmreich|first3=Jonathan E.|last4=McAdams|first4=James A.|title=Rebirth: A Political History of Europe since World War II|publisher=Westview Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8133-3664-3}}\n*{{Citation|last=B\u00f6cker|first=Anita|title=Regulation of Migration: International Experiences|publisher=Het Spinhuis|year=1998|isbn=90-5589-095-2}}\n*{{Citation|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2001|isbn=0-8153-4057-5}}\n*{{Citation|last=Crampton|first=R.

The club are nicknamed the ''Rossobl\u00f9'' due to the red-and-blue striped shirts which they wear, which are also the official colours of the city.\n\nBologna were founding members of [[Serie A]] in 1929. During its history, the club has won the Italian league championship seven times, making them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league.\nThey have participated in 73 Serie A championships out of 88, currently ninth in the ranking of the highest number of appearances of the formations in the highest Italian category.\n\nBologna currently plays in [[Serie A]], the highest level of the Italian football pyramid.\n\nSince [[1927]] the team has been competing in its internal competitions in the [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], born as Stadio del Littoriale and called, from the postwar period until 1983, Stadio Comunale. The stadium can host more than 38,000 spectators.\n\n==History==\n'''Bologna Football Club''''s formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in [[association football|football]] at university in [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]]. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.\n[[File:Bologna1912.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Bologna squad from the 1912 season.]]\n\nThe club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club's sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, [[nobleman]] Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti [[cashier]], while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.\n\nOn 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against [[Virtus Bologna|Virtus]], who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9\u20131. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.\n[[File:Bologna since 1930.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The progress of Bologna in the Italian football league structure since the first season of a unified Serie A (1929/30).]]\n\nTheir formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named ''Group Veneto-Emiliano''. They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for World War I.\n\n===Champions: 1920s and 1930s===\nAfter the [[World War I|first war]], Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919\u201320, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2\u20131 to [[U.S. Pro Vercelli Calcio|Pro Vercelli]]. They would equal this again in 1923\u201324, coming runner up to eventual national champions [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nBologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924\u201325, beating [[Genoa CFC]] after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928\u201329 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.\n[[File:Bologna Associazione Giuoco del Calcio 1936-37.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|1936\u201337 Italian champion Bologna.]]\n\nThe ''[[Scudetto]]'' was won by Bologna four more times before World War II, these were achieved in; 1935\u201336, [[1936\u201337 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1936\u201337]], [[1938\u201339 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1938\u201339]] and [[1940\u201341 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1940\u201341]].\n\n===Post-World War II===\nAfter [[World War II]], the club was less successful. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, until they took the league title back in 1963\u201364. To date this remains their last [[Serie A]] championship, bringing the club's total to seven. This qualified Bologna to the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] (today UEFA Champions League), but they were eliminated in the preliminary round against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].\n[[File:Bologna Football Club 1963-64.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The last Bologna side to win the ''scudetto'', in the 1963\u201364 season.]]\n\nIt was not all doom and gloom for the club, however; in the 1970s, they won the [[Italian Cup]] twice, the second of which was disputed against [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. The game was tense and finished 1\u20131 before going to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], where Bologna won 4\u20133.\n\n===Climbing down and back up the Leagues===\nBeginning in the 1981\u201382 season, the club began to slide. First, they were relegated from Serie A after battling it out for survival with [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. They were relegated twice in succession and slid into [[Serie C1]]. They won their way out of C1 the next year, and returned to Serie A for the 1988\u201389 season after four years of fighting it out in [[Serie B]].\n\nThey did not remain long, however, being relegated in 1991 and returning to Serie C1 in 1993. The club returned to Serie A for 1996. Two years later, Bologna tasted a slice of success on the European stage, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] and playing in the [[UEFA Cup]]. The club remained in Serie A until the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] campaign, losing to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in the playoffs.\n\n====Serie B====\nDespite losing some key players, Bologna expected to be challenging strongly for promotion from [[Serie B]] in the [[2005\u201306 Serie B|2005\u201306 campaign]]. Despite its ambition, however, Bologna had a poor start to the season, causing the sacking of experienced coach [[Renzo Ulivieri]], replaced by former [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] defender [[Andrea Mandorlini]].\n\nDuring this time, the team was sold by Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara to Alfredo Cazzola, a local entrepreneur. Mandorlini, however, was not either able to bring Bologna up the Serie B table, and was fired on 5 March 2006; Ulivieri was then appointed back as team coach, after having been sacked a few months before. Bologna ended the 2005\u201306 Serie B campaign in eighth place. In the [[2006\u201307 Serie B|2006\u201307 season]], Bologna ended with the seventh place: there were several clashes between chairman Cazzola and head coach Ulivieri, who was ultimately fired on 14 April 2007 and replaced by caretaker and former assistant coach [[Luca Cecconi]]. For the [[2007\u201308 Serie B|2007\u201308 season]], Bologna was led by [[Daniele Arrigoni]], who helped the ''rossobl\u00f9'' achieve automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B.\n\n====Serie A====\nDuring the summer of 2008, a club takeover was agreed between Cazzola and an American-based consortium; this was, however, cancelled in the end, following disagreements between the parties, and the club was successively sold to a local group led by new chairman Francesca Menarini, who thus became the second female chairman in the whole Serie A.

The club are nicknamed the ''Rossobl\u00f9'' due to the red-and-blue striped shirts which they wear, which are also the official colours of the city.\n\nBologna were founding members of [[Serie A]] in 1929. During its history, the club has won the Italian league championship seven times, making them the sixth most successful team in the history of the league.\nThey have participated in 73 Serie A championships out of 88, currently ninth in the ranking of the highest number of appearances of the formations in the highest Italian category.\n\nBologna currently plays in [[Serie A]], the highest level of the Italian football pyramid.\n\nSince [[1927]] the team has been competing in its internal competitions in the [[Stadio Renato Dall'Ara]], born as Stadio del Littoriale and called, from the postwar period until 1983, Stadio Comunale. The stadium can host more than 38,000 spectators.\n\n==History==\n'''Bologna Football Club''''s formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in [[association football|football]] at university in [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]]. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.\n[[File:Bologna1912.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Bologna squad from the 1912 season.]]\n\nThe club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club's sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, [[nobleman]] Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti [[cashier]], while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.\n\nOn 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against [[Virtus Bologna|Virtus]], who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9\u20131. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.\n[[File:Bologna since 1930.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The progress of Bologna in the Italian football league structure since the first season of a unified Serie A (1929/30).]]\n\nTheir formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named ''Group Veneto-Emiliano''. They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for World War I.\n\n===Champions: 1920s and 1930s===\nAfter the [[World War I|first war]], Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919\u201320, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2\u20131 to [[U.S. Pro Vercelli Calcio|Pro Vercelli]]. They would equal this again in 1923\u201324, coming runner up to eventual national champions [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nBologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924\u201325, beating [[Genoa CFC]] after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928\u201329 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.\n[[File:Bologna Associazione Giuoco del Calcio 1936-37.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|1936\u201337 Italian champion Bologna.]]\n\nThe ''[[Scudetto]]'' was won by Bologna four more times before World War II, these were achieved in; [[1935\u201336 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1935\u201336]], [[1936\u201337 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1936\u201337]], [[1938\u201339 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1938\u201339]] and [[1940\u201341 Bologna F.C. 1909 season|1940\u201341]].\n\n===Post-World War II===\nAfter [[World War II]], the club was less successful. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, until they took the league title back in 1963\u201364. To date this remains their last [[Serie A]] championship, bringing the club's total to seven. This qualified Bologna to the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] (today UEFA Champions League), but they were eliminated in the preliminary round against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].\n[[File:Bologna Football Club 1963-64.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The last Bologna side to win the ''scudetto'', in the 1963\u201364 season.]]\n\nIt was not all doom and gloom for the club, however; in the 1970s, they won the [[Italian Cup]] twice, the second of which was disputed against [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. The game was tense and finished 1\u20131 before going to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], where Bologna won 4\u20133.\n\n===Climbing down and back up the Leagues===\nBeginning in the 1981\u201382 season, the club began to slide. First, they were relegated from Serie A after battling it out for survival with [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. They were relegated twice in succession and slid into [[Serie C1]]. They won their way out of C1 the next year, and returned to Serie A for the 1988\u201389 season after four years of fighting it out in [[Serie B]].\n\nThey did not remain long, however, being relegated in 1991 and returning to Serie C1 in 1993. The club returned to Serie A for 1996. Two years later, Bologna tasted a slice of success on the European stage, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] and playing in the [[UEFA Cup]]. The club remained in Serie A until the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] campaign, losing to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in the playoffs.\n\n====Serie B====\nDespite losing some key players, Bologna expected to be challenging strongly for promotion from [[Serie B]] in the [[2005\u201306 Serie B|2005\u201306 campaign]]. Despite its ambition, however, Bologna had a poor start to the season, causing the sacking of experienced coach [[Renzo Ulivieri]], replaced by former [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] defender [[Andrea Mandorlini]].\n\nDuring this time, the team was sold by Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara to Alfredo Cazzola, a local entrepreneur. Mandorlini, however, was not either able to bring Bologna up the Serie B table, and was fired on 5 March 2006; Ulivieri was then appointed back as team coach, after having been sacked a few months before. Bologna ended the 2005\u201306 Serie B campaign in eighth place. In the [[2006\u201307 Serie B|2006\u201307 season]], Bologna ended with the seventh place: there were several clashes between chairman Cazzola and head coach Ulivieri, who was ultimately fired on 14 April 2007 and replaced by caretaker and former assistant coach [[Luca Cecconi]]. For the [[2007\u201308 Serie B|2007\u201308 season]], Bologna was led by [[Daniele Arrigoni]], who helped the ''rossobl\u00f9'' achieve automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B.\n\n====Serie A====\nDuring the summer of 2008, a club takeover was agreed between Cazzola and an American-based consortium; this was, however, cancelled in the end, following disagreements between the parties, and the club was successively sold to a local group led by new chairman Francesca Menarini, who thus became the second female chairman in the whole Serie A.

It means \"rectangle\" or \"square.\" But different interpretations are given to the second character ''cheng'':<ref name=Hart01/>\n\n#The earliest extant commentary, by [[Liu Hui]], dated 263 CE defines ''cheng'' as \"measures,\" citing the non-mathematical term ''kecheng'', which means \"collecting taxes according to tax rates.\" Liu then defines ''fangcheng'' as a \"rectangle of measures.\" The term ''kecheng'', however, is not a mathematical term and it appears nowhere else in the Nine Chapters.  Outside of mathematics, ''kecheng'' is a term most commonly used for collecting taxes. \n#Li Ji's \"Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Arts: Pronunciations and Meanings\" also glosses ''cheng'' as \"measure,\" again using a nonmathematical term, ''kel\u00fc'', commonly used for taxation. This is how Li Ji defines ''fangcheng'': \"''Fang'' means [on the] left and right. ''Cheng'' means terms of a ratio. Terms of a ratio [on the] left and right, combining together numerous objects, therefore [it] is called a \"rectangular array\".\" \n#[[Yang Hui]]'s \"Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Arts with Detailed Explanations\" defines ''cheng'' as a general term for measuring weight, height, and length. Detailed Explanations states:  What is called \"rectangular\" (''fang'') is the shape of the numbers; \"measure\" (''cheng'') is the general term for [all forms of] measurement, also a method for equating weights, lengths, and volumes, especially referring to measuring clearly and distinctly the greater and lesser.\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, in Chinese mathematical literature the term ''fangcheng'' has been used to denote an \"equation.\" However, as already been noted, the traditional meaning of the term is very different from \"equation.\"\n\n==Contents of the chapter titled ''Fangcheng''==\n\nThe eighth chapter titled ''Fangcheng'' of the ''Nine Chapters'' book contains 18 problems. (There are a total of 288 problems in the whole book.) Each of these 18 problems reduces to a problem of solving a system of simultaneous linear equations. Except for one problem, namely Problem 13, all the problems are determinate in the sense that the number of unknowns is same as the number of equations.  There are problems involving 2, 3, 4 and 5 unknowns. The table below shows how many unknowns are there in the various problems:\n\n<center>\n'''Table showing the number of unknowns and number of equations <br> in the various problems in Chapter 8 of ''Nine Chapters'' '''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"Text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

The procedure has been referred to as ''fangcheng shu'', which means \"''fangcheng'' procedure.\" The remaining problems all give the instruction \"follow the ''fangcheng''\" procedure sometimes followed by the instruction to use the \"procedure for positive and negative numbers\".\n\n===On Problem 3===\nThere is also a special procedure, called \"procedure for positive and negative numbers\" (''zheng fu shu'') for handling negative numbers. This procedure is explained as part of the method for solving Problem 3.\n\n===On Problem 13===\nIn the collection of these 18 problems Problem 13 is very special. In it there are 6 unknowns but only 5 equations and so Problem 13 is indeterminate and does not have a unique solution.  This is the earliest known reference to a system of linear equations in which the number of unknowns exceeds the number of equations. As per a suggestion of Jean-Claude Martzloff, a historian of Chinese mathematics, Roger Hart has named this problem \"the well problem.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|author=Christine Andrews-Larson|title=Roots of Linear Algebra: An Historical Exploration of Linear Systems|journal=PRIMUS|date=2015|volume=25|issue=6|pages=507\u2013528|doi=10.1080/10511970.2015.1027975}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kangshen Shen|author2=John N.

Outside of mathematics, ''kecheng'' is a term most commonly used for collecting taxes. \n#Li Ji's \"Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Arts: Pronunciations and Meanings\" also glosses ''cheng'' as \"measure,\" again using a nonmathematical term, ''kel\u00fc'', commonly used for taxation. This is how Li Ji defines ''fangcheng'': \"''Fang'' means [on the] left and right. ''Cheng'' means terms of a ratio. Terms of a ratio [on the] left and right, combining together numerous objects, therefore [it] is called a \"rectangular array\".\" \n#[[Yang Hui]]'s \"Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Arts with Detailed Explanations\" defines ''cheng'' as a general term for measuring weight, height, and length. Detailed Explanations states:  What is called \"rectangular\" (''fang'') is the shape of the numbers; \"measure\" (''cheng'') is the general term for [all forms of] measurement, also a method for equating weights, lengths, and volumes, especially referring to measuring clearly and distinctly the greater and lesser.\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, in Chinese mathematical literature the term ''fangcheng'' has been used to denote an \"equation.\" However, as already been noted, the traditional meaning of the term is very different from \"equation.\"\n\n==Contents of the chapter titled ''Fangcheng''==\n\nThe eighth chapter titled ''Fangcheng'' of the ''Nine Chapters'' book contains 18 problems. (There are a total of 288 problems in the whole book.) Each of these 18 problems reduces to a problem of solving a system of simultaneous linear equations. Except for one problem, namely Problem 13, all the problems are determinate in the sense that the number of unknowns is same as the number of equations.  There are problems involving 2, 3, 4 and 5 unknowns. The table below shows how many unknowns are there in the various problems:\n\n<center>\n'''Table showing the number of unknowns and number of equations <br> in the various problems in Chapter 8 of ''Nine Chapters'' '''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"Text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

The procedure has been referred to as ''fangcheng shu'', which means \"''fangcheng'' procedure.\" The remaining problems all give the instruction \"follow the ''fangcheng''\" procedure sometimes followed by the instruction to use the \"procedure for positive and negative numbers\".\n\n===On Problem 3===\nThere is also a special procedure, called \"procedure for positive and negative numbers\" (''zheng fu shu'') for handling negative numbers. This procedure is explained as part of the method for solving Problem 3.\n\n===On Problem 13=== \nIn the collection of these 18 problems Problem 13 is very special. In it there are 6 unknowns but only 5 equations and so Problem 13 is indeterminate and does not have a unique solution.  This is the earliest known reference to a system of linear equations in which the number of unknowns exceeds the number of equations. As per a suggestion of Jean-Claude Martzloff, a historian of Chinese mathematics, Roger Hart has named this problem \"the well problem.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|author=Christine Andrews-Larson|title=Roots of Linear Algebra: An Historical Exploration of Linear Systems|journal=PRIMUS|date=2015|volume=25|issue=6|pages=507\u2013528|doi=10.1080/10511970.2015.1027975}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kangshen Shen|author2=John N.
