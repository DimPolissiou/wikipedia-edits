Chapala was the third [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]]. It developed as a [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|depression]] on 28&nbsp;October off western India, and strengthened a day later into a cyclonic storm. Chapala then [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] amid favorable conditions. On 30&nbsp;October, the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD){{refn|The [[India Meteorological Department]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the northern Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Tropical Cyclones |page=47 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/cyclone-awareness/terminology/faq.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} estimated that Chapala attained peak three-minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained winds]] of 215&nbsp;km/h (130&nbsp;mph).

After peak intensity, Chapala skirted the Yemeni island of [[Socotra]] on 1&nbsp;November, becoming the first hurricane-force storm there since 1922. High winds and heavy rainfall resulted in an island-wide power outage, and severe damage was compounded by [[Cyclone Megh]], which struck Yemen a week later. \n\nWhile Chapala encountered less favorable conditions after leaving Socotra, it maintained much of its intensity; upon entering the [[Gulf of Aden]] on 2&nbsp;November, it became the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. Chapala brushed the northern coast of Somalia, killing tens of thousands of animals and wrecking 350&nbsp;houses. Ahead of the cyclone's final [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], widespread evacuations occurred across southeastern Yemen, including in areas controlled by [[al-Qaeda]], amid the country's [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|ongoing civil war]]. Early on 3&nbsp;November, the storm made landfall near [[Mukalla]], Yemen, as a [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|very severe cyclonic storm]] and the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. Chapala weakened into a remnant low the next day over land. Several years' worth of heavy rainfall inundated coastal areas, damaging roads and hundreds of homes. Eight people died in Yemen, a low total credited to the evacuations, and another 65 were injured. After cyclones Chapala and Megh, several countries, non-government organizations, and agencies within the [[United Nations]] provided monetary and material assistance to Yemen. The country faced food and fuel shortages, and residual storm effects contributed to an outbreak of locusts and [[dengue fever]], the latter of which killed seven people.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Chapala 2015 track.png|alt=Map plotting the track and the intensity of the storm, according to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]}}\nThe [[monsoon trough]] spawned a fragmented area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, southwest of [[India]] on 25&nbsp;October, 2015.

Chapala was the third [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]]. It developed as a [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|depression]] on 28&nbsp;October off western India, and strengthened a day later into a cyclonic storm. Chapala then [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] amid favorable conditions. On 30&nbsp;October, the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD){{refn|The [[India Meteorological Department]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the northern Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Tropical Cyclones |page=47 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/cyclone-awareness/terminology/faq.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} estimated that Chapala attained peak three-minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained winds]] of 215&nbsp;km/h (130&nbsp;mph).

After peak intensity, Chapala skirted the Yemeni island of [[Socotra]] on 1&nbsp;November, becoming the first hurricane-force storm there since 1922. High winds and heavy rainfall resulted in an island-wide power outage, and severe damage was compounded by [[Cyclone Megh]], which struck Yemen a week later. \n\nWhile Chapala encountered less favorable conditions after leaving Socotra, it maintained much of its intensity; upon entering the [[Gulf of Aden]] on 2&nbsp;November, it became the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. Chapala brushed the northern coast of Somalia, killing tens of thousands of animals and wrecking 350&nbsp;houses. Ahead of the cyclone's final [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], widespread evacuations occurred across southeastern Yemen, including in areas controlled by [[al-Qaeda]], amid the country's [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|ongoing civil war]]. Early on 3&nbsp;November, the storm made landfall near [[Mukalla]], Yemen, as a [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|very severe cyclonic storm]] and the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. Chapala weakened into a remnant low the next day over land. Several years' worth of heavy rainfall inundated coastal areas, damaging roads and hundreds of homes. Eight people died in Yemen, a low total credited to the evacuations, and another 65 were injured. After cyclones Chapala and Megh, several countries, non-government organizations, and agencies within the [[United Nations]] provided monetary and material assistance to Yemen. The country faced food and fuel shortages, and residual storm effects contributed to an outbreak of locusts and [[dengue fever]], the latter of which killed seven people.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Chapala 2015 track.png|alt=Map plotting the track and the intensity of the storm, according to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]}}\nThe [[monsoon trough]] spawned a fragmented area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, southwest of [[India]] on 25&nbsp;October, 2015.

For example, the English-language phrase \"The cat chases the ball\" conveys the fact that the cat is acting on the ball ''analytically'' via word order. This can be contrasted to [[synthetic language]]s, which rely heavily on inflections to convey word relationships (e.g., the phrases \"The cat chase''s'' the ball\" and \"The cat chase''d'' the ball\" convey different time frames via changing the form of the word ''chase''). Most languages are not purely analytic, but many rely primarily on analytic syntax.\n\nTypically, analytic languages have a low [[morpheme]]-per-[[word]] ratio, especially with respect to [[Morpheme#Inflectional_morphemes|inflectional morpheme]]s. A grammatical construction can similarly be ''analytic'' if it uses [[bound morphemes|unbound morphemes]], which are separate words, or [[word order]]. Analytic languages rely more heavily on the use of definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|articles]], which tend to be less prominently used or absent in strongly synthetic languages; stricter word order; various [[preposition]]s, [[postposition]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]],  and [[modifier (linguistics)|modifiers]]; and [[context (language use)|context]].\n\n==Background==\nThe term ''analytic'' is commonly used in [[synthetic language#Synthetic and analytic languages|a relative rather than an absolute sense]].
