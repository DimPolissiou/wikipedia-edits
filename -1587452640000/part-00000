He also held the title [[Baron Abergavenny]]. He was born in [[Sutton Valence]], the son of [[Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], and [[Agnes Mortimer, Countess of Pembroke|Agnes Mortimer]]. His father died when John Hastings was only a year old, and he became a ward of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] whilst remaining in his mother's care. The King arranged for John to marry Edward's daughter [[Margaret, Countess of Pembroke|Margaret]] in 1359, which drew John into the [[royal family]]. However, Margaret died two years later. John Hastings inherited his father's earldom, subsidiary titles and estates in 1368. The same year he made a second marriage, to Anne, daughter of [[Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny|Walter, Lord Mauny]]. The following year Pembroke commenced the career in royal service that was to consume the rest of his life. The [[Hundred Years' War]] had recently reignited in France, and in 1369 Pembroke journeyed to [[Aquitaine]].\n\nThere he took part in a sequence of raids, sieges, and counter-measures against the French, with both notable successes and failures. The latter were compounded by his apparent inability to work alongside the famed soldier [[Sir John Chandos]], who, although head of the King's forces there, was far below Pembroke in rank. He was, however, far above Pembroke in ability, and his subsequent death led to even more problems for Pembroke in France. A couple of years later, the earl was summoned to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] and returned to England. There, perhaps exasperated by the political failures of the king's ecclesiastical ministers, he was responsible for forcing them from power and being replaced by laymen. Pembroke was soon to return to France again, for what was to be the last time. In 1372 he set off with a small fleet, intending to raise a new army once in Aquitaine. However, his arrival had been anticipated by the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] navy (whose kingdom was then allied to France). Pembroke, outnumbered and outgunned, was forced to fight at the [[Battle of La Rochelle]], where he went down to a crushing defeat. Captured and taken to Castile, he was imprisoned in harsh conditions. It took a further three years for a large [[ransom]] to be negotiated, but in 1375, he was finally released. Returning to England through France, he was taken ill near Paris and died before reaching home. He was about 28 years old; his wife survived him, as did a son, born in 1372, whom Pembroke had never seen.{{Refn|The [[antiquarian]] [[William Dugdale]] relates the curse that had supposedly been on those that held the earldom of Pembroke ever since [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke]] had supported the execution of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas, Earl of Lancaster]] in 1322. It was said, says Dugdale, that \"none of the succeeding Earls of ''Pembroke'' ever Saw his father, nor any Father of them took delight in seeing his Child.\"{{sfn|Dugdale|1675|p=18 n.7}}|group=note}} Also named  [[John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|John]], he would eventually inherit the earldom. Pembroke was buried in [[Hereford]] in spring 1375.\n\n== Background and youth ==\n[[File:Sutton_Valence_Castle.jpg|left|thumb|Sutton Valence Castle]]\nJohn Hastings was born on 29 August 1347 at [[Sutton Valence Castle]], [[Kent]] and [[Baptism|baptised]] that day in the local church, St Mary the Virgin. He was the only son and [[heir]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} of [[Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke]] by his wife Agnes, who was [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]]'s third daughter.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Laurence Hastings died exactly a year after his sons' birth,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and John remained in the care of his mother,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} whilst becoming a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the King.{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=37}} In December that year his mother was [[grant (law)|grant]]ed 100 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] a year for his maintenance and upkeep.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}  His mother soon remarried, but her second husband (one John Haklyt) was himself dead by 1357.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} The [[wardship]] of Laurence's estates was divided between his wife Agnes, his mother (John's grandmother, Julian de Leybourne, who later married the [[William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]]), and Sir John Grey of [[Ruthin]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} John himself, in what was to be a gradual process, began receiving grants of [[manor]]s held by his father in 1362 and 1363. The following year, 1364, he received the wardship  of all his father's lands in England and Wales,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} and was appointed [[Legal guardian|keeper]] of all his grandmother's [[dower]] lands. Hastings [[Proof of age|proved his age]] on 12 September 1368, made his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King and pledged his [[fealty]], and in return he was granted [[seisin]] of all his English inheritance. The following month, he entered into those estates his father had held in [[Ireland]] and Wales. Like his father, as well as being Earl of Pembroke, he also styled himself Lord of [[Wexford]] and [[Baron Bergavenny|Abergavenny]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} He soon became a [[favourite]] of the King.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=26}}\n\n=== Marriages ===\n\nPembroke married twice. The first was [[Arranged marriage|arranged]] by King Edward III, and took place on 19 May 1359 in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to [[Margaret, Countess of Pembroke|Margaret]] (1347\u20141361), [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]'s twelve-year-old fourth daughter. She died around 1 October 1361,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} probably of [[plague (disease)|plague]].{{sfn|Prestwich|1980|p=283}} and was buried in [[Abingdon Abbey]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} The marriage was never [[Solemnization|solemnized]]{{sfn|Ormrod|2013|p=414}} and they had no children.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} This was an important match for the King;{{sfn|Waugh|1991|p=123}} the royal connection meant that, while his wife lived, Pembroke was referred to as the King's son in official records,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} as his marriage had brought him directly into the royal family.{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=110}}\n\nHe then married, in July 1368, [[Anne Manny, 2nd Baroness Manny|Anne Mauny]] (24 July 1355{{snd}}3 April 1384). She was the daughter of the famed soldier [[Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny|Walter, Lord Mauny]]{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and [[Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret]], daughter of [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas, Earl of Norfolk]], and later Duchess of Norfolk in her own right. Anne gave birth to a son by Hastings, who was known as John of Reading.{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=390\u201394}} Since his second wife was actually related to his first (they were cousins), a [[Papal dispensation]] was sought for this marriage, and received from the [[Simon Langham|Archbishop of Canterbury]] on 1 July 1368. In return, the Pope requested that the earl donate 1,000 [[gold florin]]s to the repair of [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul's]], [[Rome]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|ppp=390\u201394}} When his father-in-law died, Pembroke sent two of his [[knight]]s to take possession of all of Mauny's estates in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] for himself.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Pembroke was twenty-one at his second marriage, whilst his bride was only thirteen; Pembroke left her in England while he carved out a career for himself in France on royal service.{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\n\n== Military career ==\n[[File:Bourdeilles,_ch\u00e2teau.JPG|thumb|Bourdeilles Castle; captured by Pembroke soon after his arrival in France.]]\nMuch, if not most, of John Hastings' life was devoted to royal service, and this begun in October 1364 when he was in attendance on King Edward III at [[Dover]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Five years later he [[entail]]ed  and [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] a chunk of [[Earl of Pembroke|his earldom]], with the [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] going to the King;{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=109}} these were granted to his feoffees who granted them back to him for five years.{{sfn|Holmes|1957|p=54}} His first [[active service]] came in the same year, when he accompanied the King's son, the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Earl of Cambridge]] to [[Aquitaine]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|ppp=390\u201394}} with a force of 400 [[men-at-arms]], to reinforce the Black Prince's campaign which had suffered severe setbacks following his intervention in the [[Crown of Castile#Ascension of the Trast\u00e1mara dynasty|war of Castilian succession]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} They landed at [[St Malo]]{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\u2014apparently escaping the notice of a local French commander{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}}\u2014and began the long march south, aiming to join with Prince Edward in [[Angoul\u00eame]], whom they reached in late April 1369. They arrived at a period of military setbacks for the English, and [[Archambaud V of P\u00e9rigord|Archambaud]], [[Count of P\u00e9rigord]], was attempting to join forces with the [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]]; the earls of Pembroke and Cambridge were tasked immediately to destroy as much of Archambaud's lands as possible. This they excelled at, burning property and putting inhabitants to the sword.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}} After this [[chevauch\u00e9e]] into [[P\u00e9rigord]], Pembroke's force successfully captured [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bourdeilles|Bourdeilles castle]] after an eleven-week siege{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\u2013 mainly, in fact, due to the fact that the garrison made a mistimed [[sortie]] and allowed the English army entry.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}} [[Knighting|Knighted]] soon after by the Earl of Cambridge himself, {{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}} he continued to campaign in both [[Anjou]] and [[Poitou]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} involving much [[raid (military)|raid]]ing, some of it alongside [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} By June Pembroke was raising a large army to relieve pressure on the north [[March (territory)|march]] of Poitou; he and Cambridge were joined by [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]] around this time. They arrived in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] at the end of June 1369,{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=29}} and captured [[Roche-sur-Yon]]{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} as a result of the French captain betraying the town to the English.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} This was one of the \"most significant enclaves\" the French held inside English France, and it belonged to \"no less a person\" that the Duke of Anjou himself.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=30}} Following the taking of Roche-sur-Yon Pembroke led a successful campaign into the [[Loire Valley]]. Although he failed on the first attempt to capture [[Saumur]], he took and held both of the main bridges across the [[River Loire]] between Saumur and [[Nantes]].  Already greatly fortified, Pembroke strengthened and garrisoned them. This campaign greatly diminished the ability of the French to attack through the western march of Poitou.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nBy this time, tensions had started appearing among the English generals, particularly between Pembroke and Chandos. This was based on their vastly different social status; as [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption]] put it, Pembroke \"may have had the grander name but his inexperience showed.\"{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} Although Chandos had by now been appointed [[Seneschal of Anjou]], Pembroke\u2014with what a biographer terms \"aristocratic arrogance\"\u2014refused to serve under Chandos,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} who was, [[Richard Barber]] reminds us, only a banneret.{{sfn|Barber|2004}} It is possible that Pembroke was acting under the advice of his council, but either way, their armies were kept separate from each other on account of this.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=745}} As a result, that October (or, says Sumption, December){{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} he invaded Anjou with just his own force of 300 [[lancer]]s{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} on a [[Arson|fire-raising]] raid to [[Puirenon]]. Pembroke spent long enough there to attract attention; he was [[ambush]]ed by [[Louis de Sancerre]] or [[Jean IV de Bueil|Jean de Bueil]] (both commanded the French forces to the east of the Loire) and about 600 men: \"Pembroke's men were still struggling to form lines across the village street when the French horsemen charged into them.\" About 100 of Pembroke's men were killed or captured, and he left behind a quantity of supplies, horses and [[materiel]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} Not only was he unable to fight the attacking force off, but, having escaped to a house at the edge of the village, Pembroke was forced to call upon Chandos for his assistance{{sfn|Jack|2004}} {{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} \"In revenge,\" says [[George Edward Cokayne|Cokayne]] in his [[The Complete Peerage|''Complete Peerage'']], he attacked the town again, before being despatched to relieve [[Belleperche Abbey|Belleperche]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} in early 1370, where he raised the French siege.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} At the same, Pembroke's own agents had recruited 300 men in England to join his force, and they were soon due to sail.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=69}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The earl of Pembroke and some knights had no other remedy but to retire, as quickly as they could, into an unembattled house, which belonged to the Knights Templars, without a moat, and only enclosed with a stone wall.

The earl of Pembroke lost all his plate.{{sfn|Froissart|1808|p=12}}\n| source = [[Jean Froissart]], in his ''Chronicle'', on the rout of the Earl of Pembroke in 1369.\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n| bgcolor = A5EDFC\n}}\n\nPembroke's embarrassment, says [[historian]] R. I. Jack, \"did nothing to abate the ill feeling between the two leaders\" and \"was a serious blow to Edward III's attempts to stabilize Aquitaine.\"{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Not only had the escapade damaged the English cause in the region, but it led directly to Chandos' failure later in the year to recapture [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Abbey]] at [[Saint-Savin, Vienne]], where Chandos' met an untimely death.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} This was a major loss for the English, as neither of the remaining English captains in France, including Pembroke, had the personal skill or qualities that Chandos had had.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} The  A contemporary [[chronicle]]r, [[Thomas Walsingham]], reported the French King, [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], when he heard of Chandos' death, said that no-one was now \"left able to make peace between England and France.\"{{sfn|Walsingham|1864|p=312}}\n\nIn early 1370 Pembroke was nominated for the [[Order of the Garter]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} and his Order [[Robe]]s were ordered for him, according to government accounts, on 12 March.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} This timing allowed him to attend the order's annual feast in April. He took the [[Garter stall plate|stall]] of the deceased [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|Thomas, Earl of Warwick]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} The same year he accompanied the Black Prince\u2014who was by now suffering from the illness that was to kill him\u2014in a major campaign against [[Limoges]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Before commencing the attack, Pembroke accompanied the Prince (by now so ill that he could not stand), being conveyed on a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] \u2013 to [[Cognac, France|Cognac]], where the Prince's younger brother, [[John of Gaunt|John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]] was due to arrive in September 1370.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=81}} Notably, one of Gaunt's closest advisors was Walter, Baron Manny, Pembroke's father-in-law. Mauny had already been directing much of the English campaign from London, and was \"no doubt frustrated to find himself dictating strategy to Pembroke from Westminster;\"{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} and when Gaunt eventually arrived, Pembroke's father-in-law arrived with him.{{sfn|Sumption|2004}} Limoges was captured after a five-day siege in which the English successfully [[Tunnel warfare#Medieval warfare|mined]] the city's walls. Following its capture in October 1370, the town was sacked and many inhabitants were [[Massacre of Limoges|killed]].;{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=82\u20133}} Pembroke appears to have taken full part in these events, dishing out harsh treatment to the occupants.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} He may even have engaged the captains of the town's [[garrison]] in [[personal combat]].{{sfn|Seward|2003|p=112}}\n\n=== England, France, and defeat at La Rochelle ===\nFollowing this, in January 1371 the Prince returned to England, while Pembroke remained in France and continued to prosecute the war, now alongside Gaunt. Together they besieged Montpaon from January to February 1371, after which, Pembroke himself was recalled to London in order for him to attend the coming parliament to which he had been summoned on 8 January earlier that year.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} By this time, Pembroke dominated the [[Court (royal)|court]];{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=37}} although he was unable to persuade the King to assist him in Pembroke's dispute with [[Reginald Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Lord Grey of Ruthyn]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=112}}At this parliament,  which sat from February to March 1371,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Pembroke was appointed a [[Trier of fact|trier of petitions]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} His business at this parliament was not purely administrative; Pembroke appears to have been the main leader of an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] parliamentary faction which politically attacked the king's clerical ministers.{{sfn|Thomson|1983|p=143}} At least, so he was portrayed in some contemporary chronicles.{{sfn|Prestwich|1980|p=285}} His actions have been described as radical.{{sfn|McKisack|1991|p=291}} As a result of this assault, [[William of Wykeham]] and [[Thomas Brantingham]] (the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]] and [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]], respectively) were forced to resign, with their positions taken by [[laymen]].{{sfn|Thomson|1983|p=143}} Sumption suggests that the immediate cause for Pembroke's attack was his recent experiences at the [[front line]], in \"frustrating and underfunded campaigns\" whilst, at home, as the writer of a contemporary French [[tract (literature)|tract]] colourfully put it, \"the clergy reposed peacefully beneath shady canopies elegantly scoffing fat delicacies\"!{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=100\u20131}}\n\n==== Feud with Lord Grey of Ruthin ====\nWhile Pembroke was on campaign, Grey received word that the earl had died in France, and proceeded to enter Pembroke's [[Northamptonshire]] estate. This enraged Pembroke on his return to England in early 1371, and he petitioned the King at [[Marlborough Castle]] that September. Indeed, he probably complained to anyone who would listen; certainly [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer|Lord Latimer]]'s [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] <nowiki/>later testified that his master also discussed the event with Pembroke. Although, as Jack has since said, \"Latimer could find nothing{{Quote box\n| quote = Grey, on the strength of these rumours, entered the Hastings chace at Yardley Hastings in Northamptonshire and hunted there.

Medieval beds were not only matrimonial, but familial... apprentices, students and soldiers would customarily sleep together and travellers might well be expected to share a bed at an inn.\"{{sfn|Classen|2012|p=3}}|group=note}} Pembroke told Sr William that Grey \"would not have as much of his inheritance as he thinks he will have\" and that he saw Grey as being \"joyful\" at Pembroke's death.{{Sfn|Jack|1965|p=8}}\n\n=== Defeat at La Rochelle ===\nThe plan appears to have been for Pembroke to land at [[La Rochelle]], giving succour to Poitou and [[Saintonge]],{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=414}} and then, having strengthened Aquitaine, to have marched northwards, cross the Loire, and join up with King, in simultaneous campaigns.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=121}} Unknown to the English, however, Charles V's information from London was good enough that he knew of Pembroke' pending invasion of Aquitaine only a short time after Edward III's [[King's Council|Great Council]] had decided upon it.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=129}} [[File:Bataille navale devant La Rochelle XIVeme siecle.jpg|thumb|The Battle of La Rochelle as depicted in a [[Miniature art|miniature]] some time after 1380; note the English ships are deliberately illustrated as being lower than the Castilian.]]Pembroke though, was much delayed; although he was in [[Plymouth]] by May, his feet could not be available until June, due to a pressing shortage of ships.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=135}} Indeed, in light of the fact that the government was aware of the strength of the enemy's naval forces in the area Pembroke would be sailing to, says Sumption, the earl's own fleet was extremely vulnerable. Perhaps Pembroke expected only  to encounter [[Piracy|pirates]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=138}} But since it was known that both the French and Castilian fleets were at sea, this was still too small. Worse, since some of them had been hired from merchants, and others were individually so small that they could not be fortified.{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} Pembroke's ships reached La Rochelle on the afternoon of 22 June. Attempting to enter the harbour (the town was still held by the English), Pembroke encountered a much larger force of twelve large [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] [[galley]]s,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and eight [[carrack]]s.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=139}} They had been lying in wait for the English force ever since the latter's battle plans had become known weeks earlier,{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=193}} a French fleet under [[Owen of Wales]] was intended to join them, but arrived too late to take part.{{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=662}} Battle was joined. Before hand, the earl knighted some of his own [[squire]]s on his [[flagship]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=193}} Pembroke was not averse to fighting; as a contemporary said, the earl and his army was \"marvellously pleased... for they did not think much of the Spanish and thought to beat them easily.\"{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The knights of England and Poitou that day shewed excellent proofs of chivalry and prowess.

Pembroke found his fleet caught between the enemy and the [[sandbanks]] (located off what later became [[La Pallice]]); further, the Castilian ships possessed [[arbalest]]s, which caused great destruction to wooden decks.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=193}} Pembroke was unable to replicate the victories of earlier years (for example, at [[Battle of Winchelsea|Winchelsea]] and [[Battle of N\u00e1jera|N\u00e1jera]]) due to his lack of archers, which would otherwise allowed him to lay down a [[Suppressive fire|suppressing fire]] on the enemy crews. Likewise, Castilian command of the air meant that English soldiers were unable to [[Naval boarding|board]] Castilian ships.{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} The battle lasted two days. The fighting broke off as night fell on the 22nd; Pembroke had lost two ships, and was now surrounded by the Castilian fleet over night. Fighting recommenced the next morning. Pembroke found his flagship attacked by four of the enemy galleys, who used [[grappling hook]]s to attach themselves to the English ship, and later managed to douse the decks of some ships with oil which could then be ignited by [[fire arrow]]s.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} Fire, said, Sherborne, played a vital role in the Castilian triumph.{{sfn|Sherborne|1994|p=43}} Around this point\u2014with horses running wild and kicking holes in the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} and his men throwing themselves overboard to avoid the flames\u2014Pembroke surrendered,{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} much of his fleet burned or captured. Many of his retinue were killed, and those that survived were also captured. This number included Pembroke himself, as well as the [[Guichard d'Angle|Earl of Huntingdon]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and of course, the \u00a312,000 in silver, which was discovered untouched.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} Historians have since been universally critical of Pembroke's actions at La Rochelle. The Victorian [[antiquarian]] J. H. Ramsay described Pembroke's defeat as worst ever inflicted on the English navy,{{sfn|Ramsay|1913|pp=22\u201323}} [[E. F. Jacob]], that it was a disastrous blow,{{sfn|Jacob|1947|pp=17\u201318}} and [[Anthony Steel (historian)|Anthony Steel]] said that it lost England control of the [[English Channel|Channel]] for several years.{{sfn|Steel|1962|p=19}}\n\n=== Capture, imprisonment and ransom ===\n[[File:090920_1148_6243_SLL_Curiel_Castillo_T91.jpg|left|thumb|[[Castle of Curiel de Duero|Curiel Castle]], 2009, where Pembroke was held for the early years of his imprisonment.]]\n\nFollowing his capture, Pembroke was taken to Castile,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} along with about 160 of his men, 70 of them knights{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} (\"with golden spurs\"){{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=62 n}} and was paraded through [[Burgos]].{{sfn|Russell|1955|p=194}} There he was confined to prison, where he appears to have been treated poorly.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} The Spanish, according to custom, transported prisoners \"bound with chains or cords, like dogs in leash,\"{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} or, as reportedly at [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], in [[Leg irons|irons]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Their treatment appalled even the Castilian's French allies: the French chronicler [[Jean Froissart]] wrote, of the Castilians, that \"they know no finer courtesy, just like the Germans.\"{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=141}}\n\nWhile in prison, he received the news as to his wife's pregnancy. A fellow prisoner, [[John Trailly|Sir John Trailly]], later reported to the 1407 inquiry of Pembroke's reaction. He was not, Trailly said, happy at the news as one might expect; rather, he was moved to anger, as now he had a son, if that son died without heirs, Pembroke's careful planning against Grey might be undone.{{Sfn|Jack|1965|p=9}}{{Refn|His fears, far from being unfounded, came true: Pembroke's son died early and without issue, and this enabled Grey's son to claim the inheritance as heir-general.{{sfn|Jack|1965|p=9}}|group=note}} A few months later, possibly after negotiation with the King of France,{{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=63}} King [[Henry II of Castile]] agreed to sell his right to Pembroke's ransom to the [[Constable of France]], [[Bertrand du Guesclin]],{{sfn|Jack|2004}} for 120,000 [[French franc|francs]]. To do so, du Guesclin had to sell his Spanish lordship of [[Soria]]{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} and [[Molina de Arag\u00f3n|Molina]] (which he had previously captured from Spain),{{sfn|Jack|2004}} back to the King.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Pembroke's agreement with du Guesclin laid down that he would pay him 50,000 francs immediately, and the remainder within six weeks of Pembroke's arrival back in England. Pembroke's imprisonment was to continue for another three years, however, as\u2014despite Pembroke's supposed close connections at court and with the King{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\u2014there was little progress made in arranging for Pembroke's ransom, until early 1375.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Meanwhile, Pembroke's own circumstances were especially harsh. He was lodged at [[Curiel de Duero|Curiel Castle]] in conditions bad enough to break his health.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=141\u20132}}\n\nThe first instalment was eventually lodged in a short-term [[Moneylender|moneylending]] account{{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=165}} for du Guesclin with a [[Flemish people|Fleming]] in [[Bruges]], by which time Pembroke was ill. He was taken by du Guesclin to Paris{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}\u2014\"in short stages as kindly and gently as could be\"{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=142}}\u2014but the earl's increasing illness forced du Guesclin to make for [[Calais]] with all speed, as he had promised to facilitate the earl's return to England by [[Easter]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}\n\n== Death and succession ==\n\nPembroke died in [[Picardy]] (at either [[Arras]] or [[Moreuil]]) on 16 April 1375, following his release from prison.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Despite a contemporary rumour that he had been [[Death by poisoning|poisoned]] by the Castilians, more likely causes were the dire conditions of (at least the early years) his imprisonment{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and sickness and fatigue brought on by his hard years of confinement. Cockayne notes that, because Pembroke died in France, and the balance of his ransom was to be paid to du Guesclin after the earl had returned to England, du Guesclin never received the balance of the ransom.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}{{Refn|Although the French King did grant him 50,000 francs towards compensation.{{sfn|Jack|1965|p=9 n.2}}|group=note}}\n\nPembroke was buried in the choir of the Friars Preachers, in [[Hereford]],{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=80\u201398}} some time after 28 April 1375; the King sent offerings for the earl's funeral. Pembroke had written two wills. The first was on 5 May 1372, which was superseded by another on 26 March 1374.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} The first one declared that the earl  wanted all his debts paid \"by the hands of my executors and by the hands of the feoffees of my manors.\"{{sfn|Bean|1968|p=143}} The second will, [[Probate|proved]] in November 1376, made no mention of any feoffees, but did provide instructions for his funeral, particularly for his [[tomb]].

Pembroke's recent biographer has noted a certain immaturity of character\u2014particularly in his relationship with John Chandos\u2014whilst also noting that the biggest defeat of his career does not necessarily indicate lack of leadership or judgement on his part. The truth, R. I.

He also held the title [[Baron Abergavenny]]. He was born in [[Sutton Valence]], the son of [[Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], and [[Agnes Mortimer, Countess of Pembroke|Agnes Mortimer]]. His father died when John Hastings was only a year old, and he became a ward of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] whilst remaining in his mother's care. The King arranged for John to marry Edward's daughter [[Margaret, Countess of Pembroke|Margaret]] in 1359, which drew John into the [[royal family]]. However, Margaret died two years later. John Hastings inherited his father's earldom, subsidiary titles and estates in 1368. The same year he made a second marriage, to Anne, daughter of [[Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny|Walter, Lord Mauny]]. The following year Pembroke commenced the career in royal service that was to consume the rest of his life. The [[Hundred Years' War]] had recently reignited in France, and in 1369 Pembroke journeyed to [[Aquitaine]].\n\nThere he took part in a sequence of raids, sieges, and counter-measures against the French, with both notable successes and failures. The latter were compounded by his apparent inability to work alongside the famed soldier [[Sir John Chandos]], who, although head of the King's forces there, was far below Pembroke in rank. He was, however, far above Pembroke in ability, and his subsequent death led to even more problems for Pembroke in France. A couple of years later, the earl was summoned to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] and returned to England. There, perhaps exasperated by the political failures of the king's ecclesiastical ministers, he was responsible for forcing them from power and being replaced by laymen. Pembroke was soon to return to France again, for what was to be the last time. In 1372 he set off with a small fleet, intending to raise a new army once in Aquitaine. However, his arrival had been anticipated by the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] navy (whose kingdom was then allied to France). Pembroke, outnumbered and outgunned, was forced to fight at the [[Battle of La Rochelle]], where he went down to a crushing defeat. Captured and taken to Castile, he was imprisoned in harsh conditions. It took a further three years for a large [[ransom]] to be negotiated, but in 1375, he was finally released. Returning to England through France, he was taken ill near Paris and died before reaching home. He was about 28 years old; his wife survived him, as did a son, born in 1372, whom Pembroke had never seen.{{Refn|The [[antiquarian]] [[William Dugdale]] relates the curse that had supposedly been on those that held the earldom of Pembroke ever since [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke]] had supported the execution of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas, Earl of Lancaster]] in 1322. It was said, says Dugdale, that \"none of the succeeding Earls of ''Pembroke'' ever Saw his father, nor any Father of them took delight in seeing his Child.\"{{sfn|Dugdale|1675|p=18 n.7}}|group=note}} Also named  [[John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|John]], he would eventually inherit the earldom. Pembroke was buried in [[Hereford]] in spring 1375.\n\n== Background and youth ==\n[[File:Sutton_Valence_Castle.jpg|left|thumb|Sutton Valence Castle]]\nJohn Hastings was born on 29 August 1347 at [[Sutton Valence Castle]], [[Kent]] and [[Baptism|baptised]] that day in the local church, St Mary the Virgin. He was the only son and [[heir]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} of [[Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke]] by his wife Agnes, who was [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]]'s third daughter.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Laurence Hastings died exactly a year after his sons' birth,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and John remained in the care of his mother,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} whilst becoming a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the King.{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=37}} In December that year his mother was [[grant (law)|grant]]ed 100 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] a year for his maintenance and upkeep.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}  His mother soon remarried, but her second husband (one John Haklyt) was himself dead by 1357.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} The [[wardship]] of Laurence's estates was divided between his wife Agnes, his mother (John's grandmother, Julian de Leybourne, who later married the [[William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]]), and Sir John Grey of [[Ruthin]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} John himself, in what was to be a gradual process, began receiving grants of [[manor]]s held by his father in 1362 and 1363. The following year, 1364, he received the wardship  of all his father's lands in England and Wales,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} and was appointed [[Legal guardian|keeper]] of all his grandmother's [[dower]] lands. Hastings [[Proof of age|proved his age]] on 12 September 1368, made his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King and pledged his [[fealty]], and in return he was granted [[seisin]] of all his English inheritance. The following month, he entered into those estates his father had held in [[Ireland]] and Wales. Like his father, as well as being Earl of Pembroke, he also styled himself Lord of [[Wexford]] and [[Baron Bergavenny|Abergavenny]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} He soon became a [[favourite]] of the King.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=26}}\n\n=== Marriages ===\n\nPembroke married twice. The first was [[Arranged marriage|arranged]] by King Edward III, and took place on 19 May 1359 in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to [[Margaret, Countess of Pembroke|Margaret]] (1347\u20141361), [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]'s twelve-year-old fourth daughter. She died around 1 October 1361,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} probably of [[plague (disease)|plague]].{{sfn|Prestwich|1980|p=283}} and was buried in [[Abingdon Abbey]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} The marriage was never [[Solemnization|solemnized]]{{sfn|Ormrod|2013|p=414}} and they had no children.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} This was an important match for the King;{{sfn|Waugh|1991|p=123}} the royal connection meant that, while his wife lived, Pembroke was referred to as the King's son in official records,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} as his marriage had brought him directly into the royal family.{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=110}}\n\nHe then married, in July 1368, [[Anne Manny, 2nd Baroness Manny|Anne Mauny]] (24 July 1355{{snd}}3 April 1384). She was the daughter of the famed soldier [[Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny|Walter, Lord Mauny]]{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and [[Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret]], daughter of [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas, Earl of Norfolk]], and later Duchess of Norfolk in her own right. Anne gave birth to a son by Hastings, who was known as John of Reading.{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=390\u201394}} Since his second wife was actually related to his first (they were cousins), a [[Papal dispensation]] was sought for this marriage, and received from the [[Simon Langham|Archbishop of Canterbury]] on 1 July 1368. In return, the Pope requested that the earl donate 1,000 [[gold florin]]s to the repair of [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul's]], [[Rome]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|ppp=390\u201394}} When his father-in-law died, Pembroke sent two of his [[knight]]s to take possession of all of Mauny's estates in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] for himself.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Pembroke was twenty-one at his second marriage, whilst his bride was only thirteen; Pembroke left her in England while he carved out a career for himself in France on royal service.{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\n\n== Military career ==\n[[File:Bourdeilles,_ch\u00e2teau.JPG|thumb|Bourdeilles Castle; captured by Pembroke soon after his arrival in France.]]\nMuch, if not most, of John Hastings' life was devoted to royal service, and this begun in October 1364 when he was in attendance on King Edward III at [[Dover]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} Five years later he [[entail]]ed  and [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] a chunk of [[Earl of Pembroke|his earldom]], with the [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] going to the King;{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=109}} these were granted to his feoffees who granted them back to him for five years.{{sfn|Holmes|1957|p=54}} His first [[active service]] came in the same year, when he accompanied the King's son, the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Earl of Cambridge]] to [[Aquitaine]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|ppp=390\u201394}} with a force of 400 [[men-at-arms]], to reinforce the Black Prince's campaign which had suffered severe setbacks following his intervention in the [[Crown of Castile#Ascension of the Trast\u00e1mara dynasty|war of Castilian succession]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} They landed at [[St Malo]]{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\u2014apparently escaping the notice of a local French commander{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}}\u2014and began the long march south, aiming to join with Prince Edward in [[Angoul\u00eame]], whom they reached in late April 1369. They arrived at a period of military setbacks for the English, and [[Archambaud V of P\u00e9rigord|Archambaud]], [[Count of P\u00e9rigord]], was attempting to join forces with the [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]]; the earls of Pembroke and Cambridge were tasked immediately to destroy as much of Archambaud's lands as possible. This they excelled at, burning property and putting inhabitants to the sword.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}} After this [[chevauch\u00e9e]] into [[P\u00e9rigord]], Pembroke's force successfully captured [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bourdeilles|Bourdeilles castle]] after an eleven-week siege{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\u2013 mainly, in fact, due to the fact that the garrison made a mistimed [[sortie]] and allowed the English army entry.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}} [[Knighting|Knighted]] soon after by the Earl of Cambridge himself, {{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=27}} he continued to campaign in both [[Anjou]] and [[Poitou]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} involving much [[raid (military)|raid]]ing, some of it alongside [[Edward the Black Prince|Edward, Prince of Wales]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} By June Pembroke was raising a large army to relieve pressure on the north [[March (territory)|march]] of Poitou; he and Cambridge were joined by [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]] around this time. They arrived in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] at the end of June 1369,{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=29}} and captured [[Roche-sur-Yon]]{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} as a result of the French captain betraying the town to the English.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} This was one of the \"most significant enclaves\" the French held inside English France, and it belonged to \"no less a person\" that the Duke of Anjou himself.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=30}} Following the taking of Roche-sur-Yon Pembroke led a successful campaign into the [[Loire Valley]]. Although he failed on the first attempt to capture [[Saumur]], he took and held both of the main bridges across the [[River Loire]] between Saumur and [[Nantes]].  Already greatly fortified, Pembroke strengthened and garrisoned them. This campaign greatly diminished the ability of the French to attack through the western march of Poitou.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=31\u201332}}\n\nBy this time, tensions had started appearing among the English generals, particularly between Pembroke and Chandos. This was based on their vastly different social status; as [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption]] put it, Pembroke \"may have had the grander name but his inexperience showed.\"{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} Although Chandos had by now been appointed [[Seneschal of Anjou]], Pembroke\u2014with what a biographer terms \"aristocratic arrogance\"\u2014refused to serve under Chandos,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} who was, [[Richard Barber]] reminds us, only a banneret.{{sfn|Barber|2004}} It is possible that Pembroke was acting under the advice of his council, but either way, their armies were kept separate from each other on account of this.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=745}} As a result, that October (or, says Sumption, December){{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} he invaded Anjou with just his own force of 300 [[lancer]]s{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} on a [[Arson|fire-raising]] raid to [[Puirenon]]. Pembroke spent long enough there to attract attention; he was [[ambush]]ed by [[Louis de Sancerre]] or [[Jean IV de Bueil|Jean de Bueil]] (both commanded the French forces to the east of the Loire) and about 600 men: \"Pembroke's men were still struggling to form lines across the village street when the French horsemen charged into them.\" About 100 of Pembroke's men were killed or captured, and he left behind a quantity of supplies, horses and [[materiel]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} Not only was he unable to fight the attacking force off, but, having escaped to a house at the edge of the village, Pembroke was forced to call upon Chandos for his assistance{{sfn|Jack|2004}} {{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=47}} \"In revenge,\" says [[George Edward Cokayne|Cokayne]] in his [[The Complete Peerage|''Complete Peerage'']], he attacked the town again, before being despatched to relieve [[Belleperche Abbey|Belleperche]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} in early 1370, where he raised the French siege.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} At the same, Pembroke's own agents had recruited 300 men in England to join his force, and they were soon due to sail.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=69}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The earl of Pembroke and some knights had no other remedy but to retire, as quickly as they could, into an unembattled house, which belonged to the Knights Templars, without a moat, and only enclosed with a stone wall. All who could get there in time shut themselves in: the greater part of the others were slain or made prisoners, and their arms and their horses taken. The earl of Pembroke lost all his plate.{{sfn|Froissart|1808|p=12}}\n| source = [[Jean Froissart]], in his ''Chronicle'', on the rout of the Earl of Pembroke in 1369.\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n| bgcolor = A5EDFC\n}}\n\nPembroke's embarrassment, says [[historian]] R. I. Jack, \"did nothing to abate the ill feeling between the two leaders\" and \"was a serious blow to Edward III's attempts to stabilize Aquitaine.\"{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Not only had the escapade damaged the English cause in the region, but it led directly to Chandos' failure later in the year to recapture [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Abbey]] at [[Saint-Savin, Vienne]], where Chandos' met an untimely death.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} This was a major loss for the English, as neither of the remaining English captains in France, including Pembroke, had the personal skill or qualities that Chandos had had.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} The  A contemporary [[chronicle]]r, [[Thomas Walsingham]], reported the French King, [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], when he heard of Chandos' death, said that no-one was now \"left able to make peace between England and France.\"{{sfn|Walsingham|1864|p=312}}\n\nIn early 1370 Pembroke was nominated for the [[Order of the Garter]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} and his Order [[Robe]]s were ordered for him, according to government accounts, on 12 March.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} This timing allowed him to attend the order's annual feast in April. He took the [[Garter stall plate|stall]] of the deceased [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|Thomas, Earl of Warwick]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} The same year he accompanied the Black Prince\u2014who was by now suffering from the illness that was to kill him\u2014in a major campaign against [[Limoges]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Before commencing the attack, Pembroke accompanied the Prince (by now so ill that he could not stand), being conveyed on a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] \u2013 to [[Cognac, France|Cognac]], where the Prince's younger brother, [[John of Gaunt|John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]] was due to arrive in September 1370.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=81}} Notably, one of Gaunt's closest advisors was Walter, Baron Manny, Pembroke's father-in-law. Mauny had already been directing much of the English campaign from London, and was \"no doubt frustrated to find himself dictating strategy to Pembroke from Westminster;\"{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} and when Gaunt eventually arrived, Pembroke's father-in-law arrived with him.{{sfn|Sumption|2004}} Limoges was captured after a five-day siege in which the English successfully [[Tunnel warfare#Medieval warfare|mined]] the city's walls. Following its capture in October 1370, the town was sacked and many inhabitants were [[Massacre of Limoges|killed]].;{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=82\u20133}} Pembroke appears to have taken full part in these events, dishing out harsh treatment to the occupants.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} He may even have engaged the captains of the town's [[garrison]] in [[personal combat]].{{sfn|Seward|2003|p=112}}\n\n=== England, France, and defeat at La Rochelle ===\nFollowing this, in January 1371 the Prince returned to England, while Pembroke remained in France and continued to prosecute the war, now alongside Gaunt. Together they besieged Montpaon from January to February 1371, after which, Pembroke himself was recalled to London in order for him to attend the coming parliament to which he had been summoned on 8 January earlier that year.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} By this time, Pembroke dominated the [[Court (royal)|court]];{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=37}} although he was unable to persuade the King to assist him in Pembroke's dispute with [[Reginald Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Lord Grey of Ruthyn]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2000|p=112}}At this parliament,  which sat from February to March 1371,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Pembroke was appointed a [[Trier of fact|trier of petitions]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} His business at this parliament was not purely administrative; Pembroke appears to have been the main leader of an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] parliamentary faction which politically attacked the king's clerical ministers.{{sfn|Thomson|1983|p=143}} At least, so he was portrayed in some contemporary chronicles.{{sfn|Prestwich|1980|p=285}} His actions have been described as radical.{{sfn|McKisack|1991|p=291}} As a result of this assault, [[William of Wykeham]] and [[Thomas Brantingham]] (the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]] and [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]], respectively) were forced to resign, with their positions taken by [[laymen]].{{sfn|Thomson|1983|p=143}} Sumption suggests that the immediate cause for Pembroke's attack was his recent experiences at the [[front line]], in \"frustrating and underfunded campaigns\" whilst, at home, as the writer of a contemporary French [[tract (literature)|tract]] colourfully put it, \"the clergy reposed peacefully beneath shady canopies elegantly scoffing fat delicacies\"!{{sfn|Sumption|2012|pp=100\u20131}}\n\n==== Feud with Lord Grey of Ruthin ====\nWhile Pembroke was on campaign, Grey received word that the earl had died in France, and proceeded to enter Pembroke's [[Northamptonshire]] estate. This enraged Pembroke on his return to England in early 1371, and he petitioned the King at [[Marlborough Castle]] that September.

To avoid Grey inheriting a penny in the event of Pembroke's death, the earl received the King's permission to make a further enfeoffment{{sfn|Given-Wilson|1997|pp=146\u201347}} following the one in 1369.{{sfn|Holmes|1957|p=54}} This specified that \u2013 after his debts had been paid{{sfn|Bean|1968|p=144}} \u2013 of much of his land in favour of a cousin, [[William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny|William Beauchamp]]. Beauchamp was not only his friend but in Pembroke's eyes a worthy successor to his title. [[Chris Given-Wilson]] has commented on this episode that \"few men acted in such an extreme fashion ... simply out of personal dislike.\"{{sfn|Given-Wilson|1997|pp=146\u201347}} However the situation never arose since he had a male heir born to him soon after.{{sfn|Bean|1968|p=144 n.4}}{{Refn|Yet the dispute had implications that echoed for the next sixty years or more, as up until 1436, the Lord Greys of Ruthin did indeed repeatedly claim to be [[heir-general]] of childless Earls of Pembroke. Although the Hastings line died out in 1389, the Greys' claim was then itself disputed by other families with dynastic links to the earls.{{sfn|Jack|1965|p=1}}|group=note}} Beauchamp was a younger son of [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick|Thomas, Earl of Warwick]], who had died of plague in 1369, and so was a cousin to Pembroke; they were on good terms, clearly.{{Refn|Pembroke and William Beauchamp were matrilineal cousins: Their mothers were both daughters of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]].{{sfn|Davies|2004}}{{sfn|Tuck|2004}}|group=note}} Thus began the process which did eventually result in Ruthin's disinheritance.  Much of the Hastings estates had been enfeoffed in 1369 and returned to him; now, in April 1372, he [[Quitclaim deed|quitclaimed]] them back to the feoffees again.{{Sfn|Jack|1965|p=8}} They were instructed that, if Pembroke died abroad, the Hastings estates were to go to the King and everything else to Beauchamp. Even if Beauchamp was not available, Ruthin was still out of the succession: the relatively-distantly related Sir William Clinton.{{Sfn|Jack|1965|p=8}}\n\n==== Return to France ====\nPembroke soon returned to France and the war. It is possible that he was personally requested to lead the campaign. He was, after all, the nearest thing to a member of the royal family, as well as the fact that to the Gascons at least, his previous efforts there had been looked on favourably.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=120}} By this time the government too viewed Pembroke as a \"military prodigy in the style of the 1330s.\"{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} On 5 March 1372 he [[indenture]]d with the King to serve in Aquitaine, to which end he was appointed [[Lieutenant of Aquitaine]].{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=80\u201398}} [[Mark Ormrod (historian)|Mark Ormrod]] has described the campaign as a minor one.{{sfn|Ormrod|2013|p=511}} This is because was accompanied only by his personal [[retinue]] of 160, in a fleet of \"little more than a dozen small vessels protected by three larger ships with towers.\"{{sfn|Jack|2004}} His appointment was on 20 April, and he sailed to the [[Bay of Biscay]] in June{{sfn|Jack|2004}} with a fleet of reinforcements.{{sfn|Prestwich|1980|p=184}} Not only did he carry with him extra troops but also, intending to raise a larger force once in Aquitaine, he took [[\u00a3]]12,000 in [[silver coin]] to pay for it.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Pembroke was instructed to recruit 500 knights, 1,500 esquires, and 1,000 archers.{{sfn|Sherborne|1994|p=41}} He was sailing, however, with an overly-small fleet{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} (that was \"gravely inadequate\" commented [[James Sherborne]]){{sfn|Sherborne|1994|p=42}} and which was, tactically, being despatched prematurely.{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}}\n\n===== Disinheritance of Lord Grey of Ruthin=====\nTraveling with Pembroke to France this time was William Beauchamp, and the later legal dockets indicate that whilst on campaign they continued to discuss Reginald Grey's disinheritance. We are told that, on one occasion when they shared a bed (\"''gisantz ensemble en un lit''\"),{{Refn|Not to be read in a modern sense of the phrase. As Constance Classen explained in 2012, \"Not even at night did individuals necessarily retreat to their own private space. Medieval beds were not only matrimonial, but familial... apprentices, students and soldiers would customarily sleep together and travellers might well be expected to share a bed at an inn.\"{{sfn|Classen|2012|p=3}}|group=note}} Pembroke told Sr William that Grey \"would not have as much of his inheritance as he thinks he will have\" and that he saw Grey as being \"joyful\" at Pembroke's death.{{Sfn|Jack|1965|p=8}}\n\n=== Defeat at La Rochelle ===\nThe plan appears to have been for Pembroke to land at [[La Rochelle]], giving succour to Poitou and [[Saintonge]],{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=414}} and then, having strengthened Aquitaine, to have marched northwards, cross the Loire, and join up with King, in simultaneous campaigns.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=121}} Unknown to the English, however, Charles V's information from London was good enough that he knew of Pembroke' pending invasion of Aquitaine only a short time after Edward III's [[King's Council|Great Council]] had decided upon it.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=129}} [[File:Bataille navale devant La Rochelle XIVeme siecle.jpg|thumb|The Battle of La Rochelle as depicted in a [[Miniature art|miniature]] some time after 1380; note the English ships are deliberately illustrated as being lower than the Castilian.]]Pembroke though, was much delayed; although he was in [[Plymouth]] by May, his feet could not be available until June, due to a pressing shortage of ships.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=135}} Indeed, in light of the fact that the government was aware of the strength of the enemy's naval forces in the area Pembroke would be sailing to, says Sumption, the earl's own fleet was extremely vulnerable. Perhaps Pembroke expected only  to encounter [[Piracy|pirates]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=138}} But since it was known that both the French and Castilian fleets were at sea, this was still too small. Worse, since some of them had been hired from merchants, and others were individually so small that they could not be fortified.{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} Pembroke's ships reached La Rochelle on the afternoon of 22 June. Attempting to enter the harbour (the town was still held by the English), Pembroke encountered a much larger force of twelve large [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] [[galley]]s,{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and eight [[carrack]]s.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=139}} They had been lying in wait for the English force ever since the latter's battle plans had become known weeks earlier,{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=193}} a French fleet under [[Owen of Wales]] was intended to join them, but arrived to late to take part.{{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=662}} Battle was joined. Before hand, the earl knighted some of his own [[squire]]s on his [[flagship]].{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=193}} Pembroke was not averse to fighting; as a contemporary said, the earl and his army was \"marvellously pleased... for they did not think much of the Spanish and thought to beat them easily.\"{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The knights of England and Poitou that day shewed excellent proofs of chivalry and prowess.

Pembroke found his fleet caught between the enemy and the [[sandbanks]] (located off what later became [[La Pallice]]); further, the Castilian ships possessed [[arbalest]]s, which caused great destruction to wooden decks.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=193}} Pembroke was unable to replicate the victories of earlier years (for example, at [[Battle of Winchelsea|Winchelsea]] and [[Battle of N\u00e1jera|N\u00e1jera]]) due to his lack of archers, which would otherwise allowed him to lay down a [[Suppressive fire|suppressing fire]] on the enemy crews. Likewise, Castilian command of the air meant that English soldiers were unable to [[Naval boarding|board]] Castilian ships.{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} The battle lasted two days. The fighting broke off as night fell on the 22nd; Pembroke had lost two ships, and was now surrounded by the Castilian fleet over night. Fighting recommenced the next morning. Pembroke found his flagship attacked by four of the enemy galleys, who used [[grappling hook]]s to attach themselves to the English ship, and later managed to douse the decks of some ships with oil which could then be ignited by [[fire arrow]]s.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} Fire, said, Sherborne, played a vital role in the Castilian triumph.{{sfn|Sherborne|1994|p=43}} Around this point\u2014with horses running wild and kicking holes in the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s{{sfn|Cushway|2011|pp=191\u2013207}} and his men throwing themselves overboard to avoid the flames\u2014Pembroke surrendered,{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} much of his fleet burned or captured. Many of his retinue were killed, and those that survived were also captured. This number included Pembroke himself, as well as the [[Guichard d'Angle|Earl of Huntingdon]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}{{sfn|Jack|2004}} and of course, the \u00a312,000 in silver, which was discovered untouched.{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} Historians have since been universally critical of Pembroke's actions at La Rochelle. The Victorian [[antiquarian]] J. H. Ramsay described Pembroke's defeat as worst ever inflicted on the English navy,{{sfn|Ramsay|1913|pp=22\u201323}} [[E. F. Jacob]], that it was a disastrous blow,{{sfn|Jacob|1947|pp=17\u201318}} and [[Anthony Steel (historian)|Anthony Steel]] said that it lost England control of the [[English Channel|Channel]] for several years.{{sfn|Steel|1962|p=19}}\n\n=== Capture, imprisonment and ransom ===\n[[File:090920_1148_6243_SLL_Curiel_Castillo_T91.jpg|left|thumb|[[Castle of Curiel de Duero|Curiel Castle]], 2009, where Pembroke was held for the early years of his imprisonment.]]\n\nFollowing his capture, Pembroke was taken to Castile,{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} along with about 160 of his men, 70 of them knights{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=140}} (\"with golden spurs\"){{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=62 n}} and was paraded through [[Burgos]].{{sfn|Russell|1955|p=194}} There he was confined to prison, where he appears to have been treated poorly.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} The Spanish, according to custom, transported prisoners \"bound with chains or cords, like dogs in leash,\"{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}} or, as reportedly at [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], in [[Leg irons|irons]].{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Their treatment appalled even the Castilian's French allies: the French chronicler [[Jean Froissart]] wrote, of the Castilians, that \"they know no finer courtesy, just like the Germans.\"{{sfn|Sumption|2012|p=141}}\n\nWhile in prison, he received the news as to his wife's pregnancy. A fellow prisoner, [[John Trailly|Sir John Trailly]], later reported to the 1407 inquiry of Pembroke's reaction. He was not, Trailly said, happy at the news as one might expect; rather, he was moved to anger, as now he had a son, if that son died without heirs, Pembroke's careful planning against Grey might be undone.{{Sfn|Jack|1965|p=9}}{{Refn|His fears, far from being unfounded, came true: Pembroke's son died early and without issue, and this enabled Grey's son to claim the inheritance as heir-general.{{sfn|Jack|1965|p=9}}|group=note}} A few months later, possibly after negotiation with the King of France,{{sfn|Amb\u00fchl|2013|p=63}} King [[Henry II of Castile]] agreed to sell his right to Pembroke's ransom to the [[Constable of France]], [[Bertrand du Guesclin]],{{sfn|Jack|2004}} for 120,000 [[French franc|francs]].

Pembroke's imprisonment was to continue for another three years, however, as\u2014despite Pembroke's supposed close connections at court and with the King{{sfn|Jack|2004}}\u2014there was little progress made in arranging for Pembroke's ransom, until early 1375.{{sfn|Jack|2004}} Meanwhile, Pembroke's own circumstances were especially harsh.

Cockayne notes that, because Pembroke died in France, and the balance of his ransom was to be paid to du Guesclin after the earl had returned to England, du Guesclin never received the balance of the ransom.{{sfn|Cokayne|1945|pp=390\u201394}}{{Refn|Although the French King did grant him 50,000 francs towards compensation.{{sfn|Jack|1965|p=9 n.2}}|group=note}}\n\nPembroke was buried in the choir of the Friars Preachers, in [[Hereford]],{{sfn|Hasted|1798|pp=80\u201398}} some time after 28 April 1375; the King sent offerings for the earl's funeral.

In 1815, he successfully commanded {{USS|Java|1815|2}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Second Barbary War]]. So seminal was his career that he was lionized in the press (being the subject of scores of books and articles).<ref name=\"biblio\">[[#Paullin|Paullin, 1918]], See ''Bibliography''</ref> He has been frequently memorialized, and many places, ships and persons have been named in his honor.\n\n'''[[Matthew Calbraith Perry]]'''{{#tag:ref|Perry's middle name is often misspelled as '''G'''albraith instead of '''C'''albraith|group=\"Note\"}} (April 10, 1794 \u2013 March 4, 1858) was a [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] of the [[United States Navy]] who commanded ships in several wars, including the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848). He played a leading role in the [[Bakumatsu|opening of Japan]] to the West with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854.\n\nPerry was interested in the education of naval officers, and assisted in the development of an apprentice system that helped establish the curriculum at the [[United States Naval Academy]].

Then he moved into the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]] mansion with Alan.

Jason meets Robin again on a bridge and they begin a friendship which turns into a romantic relationship. Robin encouraged Jason to develop relationships with Lila, Emily, and Monica, and he stood by Robin at the Nurses Ball, where she shares with Port Charles for the first time that she is HIV positive. Robin leaves for college at Yale University, and Jason asks her friend [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) for a job. His loyalty and hard work impress Sonny. Jason becomes Sonny's personal enforcer in his [[organized crime|mob business]].<ref name=\"Q Curse\" /> Robin returns in 1997 and was with Jason when he was shot for the first time by the Tin Man. Jason was operated on and saved. Robin begged Jason to leave his dangerous life behind. When Jason refused Robin begged Sonny to fire Jason. Initially hesitant, Sonny finally relented. Jason was infuriated when Sonny told him he was fired, and knew Robin was to blame. He and Robin broke up, and Robin made plans to leave town again. Jason met Robin on the bridge, and they said a last goodbye.\n\nTo help [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Benson]] (then [[Sarah Joy Brown]]), Jason pretends to be the father of her baby. Carly develops [[postpartum depression]] after giving birth to her son, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]], and leaves town. Robin returns to Port Charles and Jason confesses that the child is A.J.'s. Jason and Michael bond with Robin during Carly's absence. [[Tony Jones (General Hospital)|Dr. Tony Jones]] ([[Brad Maule]]) kidnaps Michael and Robin. Jason eventually rescues them both. At trial, Carly shoots Tony in a moment of temporary insanity and is remanded to a mental facility. In Carly's absence, Jason and Robin reunite. After Robin is almost killed in an explosion, Jason leaves the mob. Carly is released from the hospital, which puts a strain on Jason and Robin's relationship. Robin tells A.J. that he is Michael's father, and Jason temporarily loses custody of Michael. A.J. and Carly marry, and a judge awards joint custody to Jason, A.J. and Carly. Jason fears his hatred of A.J. will hurt Michael and signs away all rights; however, he remains an integral part of Michael's life. Jason comforts [[Elizabeth Webber]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) over the supposed death of her boyfriend, [[Lucky Spencer]] ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]). Carly misunderstands their relationship, and sleeps with Sonny. Jason is unable to deal with the betrayal of Sonny and Carly, and leaves town. Jason and Elizabeth are later romantically drawn to each other, but a relationship is never established.\n\n===2000s===\nJason marries Brenda to avoid testifying against each other in a murder trial. They are cleared of the charges, and later get divorced. Soon after, Jason ends up falling in love with Sonny's sister, [[Courtney Matthews]] ([[Alicia Leigh Willis]]), and they begin a relationship, despite Sonny's disapproval. Courtney and Jason marry, but a miscarriage and the stress of the mob life tear them apart, and they annul their marriage. When Jason discovers that Sonny's mistress, [[Sam McCall]] ([[Kelly Monaco]]), is pregnant, he pretends to be the father of Sam's baby so Sonny will stay with his wife, Carly. The two bonded as the pregnancy advanced, and Sam wanted Jason to be a part of her baby's life. Sadly, Sonny and Sam's daughter is stillborn, but Jason helped Sam cope with the loss, and the two eventually fall in love and got engaged. When all three of Sonny's children are kidnapped, Jason and Sam rescue them from A.J., who is killed soon after. Jason takes a drug to remember A.J.'s killer, but later causes memory loss. Sam convinces Jason to go on an experimental drug that Robin finds, to help him regain his memory. The drug works but causes a brain aneurysm. They moved back to Hawaii where they plan to spend the last days of Jason's life. Jason later changes his mind, and has an operation that saves his life.\n\nWhen Sam is shot and almost dies, Sam's mother [[Alexis Davis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]) guilts Jason into breaking up with Sam for the Summer of 2006. Jason later changes his mind, and tries to reconcile with her, but witnesses Sam sleeping with [[Ric Lansing]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). Jason goes home and Elizabeth shows up. They sleep together, and Elizabeth ends up pregnant. Elizabeth claims Lucky is the father, but later tells Jason the truth during the [[Jerry Jacks#The Hostage Crisis|Metro Court hostage crisis]]. Elizabeth gives birth to a son, [[Jacob Martin Spencer]]. Sam finds out about Jake's paternity, and she and Jason began a 2-year break up. Jake's paternity is revealed to Lucky, but they agree to let Lucky be the father. Jason and Elizabeth start dating and get engaged, but when Michael is shot and left in a coma, Jason breaks up with Elizabeth. Jason ends up taking over Sonny's business after Sonny decides to leave the mob since it's too dangerous to his family. Sonny tries to rejoin the mob, but Jason prevents him access. Sonny tries to regain his power by marrying [[Claudia Zacchara]] ([[Sarah Joy Brown]]), daughter of rival mob boss [[Anthony Zacchara]] ([[Bruce Weitz]]).\n\nWhen Jason's friend and trusted associate [[Damian Spinelli]] ([[Bradford Anderson]]) is set up and arrested for his illegal activities, Jason is forced to agree to a deal to gain Spinelli's freedom by getting Anthony arrested. The feds renege on their promise, and make Jason get Sonny arrested too, which Jason refuses. Spinelli is freed when Sam helps Jason destroy the evidence against him. Jason and Sonny reconcile, and Jason gives the business back. Michael wakes up from his year-long coma, and Jason suspects that Claudia is responsible for Michael's shooting. When Michael and [[Kristina Davis]] ([[Lexi Ainsworth]]) run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason track the siblings, but encounter [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]). Jason is shot and left to die by Jerry. Sam rescues Jason, and cares for him; the two reconnect. Jason and Sam find Michael and Kristina, and bring them back to Port Charles. He and Sam start dating again as lovers for the first time in 2 years. Jason and Sam find the proof they need to confirm Claudia's involvement in Michael's shooting. They hand it over to Sonny, who confronts Claudia. Cornered, Claudia takes a pregnant Carly hostage, and escapes. Michael ends up finding them before Jason & Sam can, and kills Claudia to protect Carly and his baby sister, [[Josslyn Jacks]]. To protect Michael, Jason covers up the crime and makes it look like Claudia disappeared.\n\n===2010s===\nJason is stalked by obsessed artist [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] ([[James Franco]]), who exposes Claudia's murder and gets Michael sent to prison. Jason makes a deal to go to prison to protect Michael, but they are both eventually released. After Jake dies in an accident, a grief-stricken Jason realizes how much he wants a family, and proposes to Sam; they get engaged, and marry soon after. During their honeymoon in Hawaii, Sam and Jason are drugged by Franco. He locks Jason in a room, and forces him to watch as he apparently rapes Sam. After returning to Port Charles, Jason kills Franco, but Sam finds out she's pregnant. A paternity test establishes Jason as the father. However, Sam is led to believe that Franco is Jason's fraternal twin brother. Another DNA test shows that Franco is the father, and Jason has a hard time accepting the news, separating the couple. Jason eventually tries to make amends with Sam the same night she gives birth to a baby boy, but they are led to believe her son died, and mourn the baby's death. Unknown to either, Sam's son was actually switched by [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] ([[Robin Mattson]]) and [[Todd Manning]] ([[Roger Howarth]]) with the stillborn [[Victor Lord III]]. It's also revealed that Jason is the baby's father because Heather switched the paternity test. The baby's \"death\" causes Jason and Sam's marriage to deteriorate, and they agree to divorce. Jason eventually figures out that the baby that died wasn't Sam's. He and Sam are eventually reunited with their son, whom they name [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Edward Morgan]]. That night, Jason is shot by [[Cesar Faison]] ([[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]]), who kicks him into the water; Jason is presumed dead. Not long after he disappears, Sam finds out Jason is Danny's biological father.\n\nAlmost two years later, Jason was revealed to be alive, being held captive by [[Victor Cassadine]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]). Victor gets Robin to revive Jason, then has him locked up to use his abilities. Jason manages to escape, only to be hit by a car. He is brought to General Hospital, and has multiple reconstructive surgeries to his face. Jason ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) wakes up with amnesia, and is tended to by Elizabeth. He believes his name to be Jake. [[Helena Cassadine]] ([[Constance Towers]]) uses \"Jake\" through mind control to carry out her sinister plans. In the meantime, he and Elizabeth grow closer. When Jason is caught for his crimes, they find a chip inside his head that Helena uses to control him. Jason undergoes surgery to remove the chip, but still can't remember his real identity. Soon after, [[Hayden Barnes]] ([[Rebecca Budig]]) arrives, claiming to be \"Jake's\" wife, but she is exposed as a fraud. Elizabeth learns \"Jake\"'s identity, but keeps it a secret to pursue a relationship with Jason. Elizabeth and Jason's son, Jake, is found alive and being held captive by Helena. He is rescued, and returned to Elizabeth & Jason. \"Jake\" proposes to Elizabeth, and she accepts. He asks Sam for help to figure out his real identity. Spinelli and Carly figure out \"Jake\" is actually Jason. \"Jake\" finds out his true identity on his wedding day. Jason still can't remember his past, and decides to divorce Sam so he can marry Elizabeth. Sam figures out that Elizabeth knew who Jason was, and tells him. Heartbroken over her deception, Jason breaks up with Elizabeth.\n\nWhile dealing with Jake's anger over his father leaving, Jason grows closer to Sam, and the two slowly start to rebuild their relationship. When Jake is almost hit by a car and Jason saves Sam from an explosion, the two eventually agree to start over. Sam asks Jason for a divorce, though, hoping to not pressure Jason into remembering their past. Jason reluctantly agrees. Soon after, Jason is in an accident, and ends up saving [[Dante Falconeri]]'s ([[Dominic Zamprogna]]) life. While trying to rescue Dante, he starts having visions of Robin, Carly, Helena, Sam, and Sonny. Jason's memory finally returns, and he reconnects with his family and friends; despite reconnecting with Sonny, Jason decides not to go back into the mob for the sake of his family. Jason goes on the run with Sam when he is accused of murder. They find the evidence to clear Jason's name, and return to Port Charles. After returning, Sam found out that she was pregnant, and Jason was ecstatic; he proposed to Sam, and they remarried soon after. Jason investigated the car bombing that killed [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]), Sonny and Carly's son, in an attempt to clear Sonny's name. He teams up with [[Curtis Ashford]] ([[Donnell Turner]]), and they figure out the culprit was [[Olivia St. John]] ([[Tonja Walker]]), who was trying to kill [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]). Jason ends up rescuing Sam after Olivia kidnaps her. Sam goes into labor, and Jason is forced to deliver their daughter, [[Children of General Hospital#Scout Cain|Emily Scout Morgan]].\n\nJason tries to help Sonny leave the mob, but ends up getting shot in an ambush. He goes into a coma for several weeks. At the same time, a man known as \"Patient 6\" (Burton) is seen in Russia with Jason's original face. Patient 6 makes his way back to Port Charles, just as Jason wakes up. Patient 6 claims to be Jason, and is eventually believed to be the real Jason by many. Franco, proven to not be Jason's twin brother, reveals that Jason did have a twin brother named Andrew, but they do not know where he is. It's revealed that [[Andre Maddox]] ([[Anthony Montgomery]]) used Jason and Andrew as part of a memory-mapping experiment, putting Jason's memories into Andrew, making them both believe they're Jason. Andre reveals that Patient 6 is Jason, and the \"other Jason\" is his twin brother, [[Drew Cain]]. Jason decides to find Faison, in hopes of figuring out why he and Drew were abducted. Meanwhile, he and Sam file for divorce, as she decides to stay with Drew.  On January 22, 2018, Jason was fighting for Sam, in order to stop the wedding, but it was too late when she married Drew.  In March 2018, during an earthquake that started shaking, Jason and Sam hide safely.  Then in the aftermath of the quake, Jason and Sam developed feelings for each other.  By March 23, 2018, she told her husband, Drew that she had feelings and love for Jason, her ex-husband, that had her break up with Drew, who moved out of her penthouse.\n\n==Reception==\nBurton's portrayal of Jason Morgan earned him two [[Soap Opera Digest Awards]] for Outstanding Younger Lead Actor in 1997 and 1998.<ref name=\"1997 Awards\">{{cite news|title='General Hospital' wins Soap Opera awards|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qo4NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BHADAAAAIBAJ&dq=13th%20soap%20opera%20digest%20awards&pg=6877%2C175987|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 1, 1997}}</ref><ref name=\"1998 Awards\">{{cite news|title='General Hospital' tops in soap opera awards|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_tNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dG8DAAAAIBAJ&dq=14th%20soap%20opera%20digest%20awards&pg=6703%2C3292551|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 3, 1998|agency=Associated Press|author-link = Associated Press}}</ref> He was nominated for the 1997 [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series]] and won the 1998 [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]].

Following Jason's split from the Quartermaines, except for his sister Emily and grandmother [[Lila Quartermaine|Lila Morgan Quartermaine]] ([[Anna Lee]]), and a change of his surname to ''Morgan,'' he would become the right-hand man for mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]).<ref name=\"BurtonTVGuide\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/General-Hospital-Steve-Burton-1036302.aspx|title=General Hospital's Steve Burton on Jason's Life or Death Surgery|magazine=TV Guide|author=Michael Logan|date=2011-08-11|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> At the time, Burton was considering leaving the show and joked that a producer noted that he played every scene, the same way, as if someone was about to die.

The death of his father Alan and a shooting that left Michael in a year-long coma opened his eyes to what the Quartermaines suffered after his own accident. For that point on, Jason was shown to be more open to a relationship with his mother Monica, and eventually his grandfather [[Edward Quartermaine]] ([[John Ingle]]). The extent of the thaw with his family could also be seen through Jason's decision to name his son, [[Children of General Hospital#Danny Morgan|Daniel Edward]], after his grandfather.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1980s===\nJason was conceived out of his father, [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]]'s ([[Stuart Damon]]), affair with [[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Susan Moore|Susan Moore]] (Gail Ramsey).

J. Quartermaine|A.J.]]. Jason lived with his mother and [[Scott Baldwin]] ([[Kin Shriner]]) up until her death, upon which he lived with Susan's aunt, [[List of General Hospital characters#G|Alice Grant]] (Lieux Dressler). Then he moved into the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]] mansion with Alan. Alan's wife, [[Monica Quartermaine|Monica]] ([[Leslie Charleson]]), initially rejected Jason, but eventually grew to love him and later adopted him.

Jason has relationships with [[Karen Wexler]] (Cari Shayne), [[Brenda Barrett]] ([[Vanessa Marcil]]), [[Robin Scorpio]] ([[Kimberly McCullough]]) and [[Keesha Ward]] ([[Senait Ashenafi]]). Jason supports Monica through her health crisis with [[breast cancer]] and adores his adoptive sister, [[Emily Quartermaine]] (then [[Amber Tamblyn]]). In December 1995, an intoxicated A.J. runs his car into a tree. Jason, who was attempting to stop A.J. from driving, is in the passenger seat and hits his head on a large boulder after being ejected from the car.

His personality drastically changes.<ref name=\"Q Curse\" /> Jason eventually turns his back on his family, and changes his surname to Morgan,<ref name=\"Q Curse\" /> Lila's maiden name. Jason meets Robin again on a bridge and they begin a friendship which turns into a romantic relationship. Robin encouraged Jason to develop relationships with Lila, Emily, and Monica, and he stood by Robin at the Nurses Ball, where she shares with Port Charles for the first time that she is HIV positive. Robin leaves for college at Yale University, and Jason asks her friend [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) for a job. His loyalty and hard work impress Sonny. Jason becomes Sonny's personal enforcer in his [[organized crime|mob business]].<ref name=\"Q Curse\" /> Robin returns in 1997 and was with Jason when he was shot for the first time by the Tin Man. Jason was operated on and saved. Robin begged Jason to leave his dangerous life behind. When Jason refused Robin begged Sonny to fire Jason. Initially hesitant, Sonny finally relented. Jason was infuriated when Sonny told him he was fired, and knew Robin was to blame. He and Robin broke up, and Robin made plans to leave town again. Jason met Robin on the bridge, and they said a last goodbye.\n\nTo help [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Benson]] (then [[Sarah Joy Brown]]), Jason pretends to be the father of her baby. Carly develops [[postpartum depression]] after giving birth to her son, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]], and leaves town. Robin returns to Port Charles and Jason confesses that the child is A.J.'s. Jason and Michael bond with Robin during Carly's absence. [[Tony Jones (General Hospital)|Dr. Tony Jones]] ([[Brad Maule]]) kidnaps Michael and Robin. Jason eventually rescues them both. At trial, Carly shoots Tony in a moment of temporary insanity and is remanded to a mental facility. In Carly's absence, Jason and Robin reunite. After Robin is almost killed in an explosion, Jason leaves the mob. Carly is released from the hospital, which puts a strain on Jason and Robin's relationship. Robin tells A.J. that he is Michael's father, and Jason temporarily loses custody of Michael. A.J. and Carly marry, and a judge awards joint custody to Jason, A.J. and Carly. Jason fears his hatred of A.J. will hurt Michael and signs away all rights; however, he remains an integral part of Michael's life. Jason comforts [[Elizabeth Webber]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) over the supposed death of her boyfriend, [[Lucky Spencer]] ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]). Carly misunderstands their relationship, and sleeps with Sonny. Jason is unable to deal with the betrayal of Sonny and Carly, and leaves town. Jason and Elizabeth are later romantically drawn to each other, but a relationship is never established.\n\n===2000s===\nJason marries Brenda to avoid testifying against each other in a murder trial. They are cleared of the charges, and later get divorced. Soon after, Jason ends up falling in love with Sonny's sister, [[Courtney Matthews]] ([[Alicia Leigh Willis]]), and they begin a relationship, despite Sonny's disapproval. Courtney and Jason marry, but a miscarriage and the stress of the mob life tear them apart, and they annul their marriage. When Jason discovers that Sonny's mistress, [[Sam McCall]] ([[Kelly Monaco]]), is pregnant, he pretends to be the father of Sam's baby so Sonny will stay with his wife, Carly. The two bonded as the pregnancy advanced, and Sam wanted Jason to be a part of her baby's life. Sadly, Sonny and Sam's daughter is stillborn, but Jason helped Sam cope with the loss, and the two eventually fall in love and got engaged. When all three of Sonny's children are kidnapped, Jason and Sam rescue them from A.J., who is killed soon after. Jason takes a drug to remember A.J.'s killer, but later causes memory loss. Sam convinces Jason to go on an experimental drug that Robin finds, to help him regain his memory. The drug works but causes a brain aneurysm. They moved back to Hawaii where they plan to spend the last days of Jason's life. Jason later changes his mind, and has an operation that saves his life.\n\nWhen Sam is shot and almost dies, Sam's mother [[Alexis Davis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]) guilts Jason into breaking up with Sam for the Summer of 2006. Jason later changes his mind, and tries to reconcile with her, but witnesses Sam sleeping with [[Ric Lansing]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). Jason goes home and Elizabeth shows up. They sleep together, and Elizabeth ends up pregnant. Elizabeth claims Lucky is the father, but later tells Jason the truth during the [[Jerry Jacks#The Hostage Crisis|Metro Court hostage crisis]]. Elizabeth gives birth to a son, [[Jacob Martin Spencer]]. Sam finds out about Jake's paternity, and she and Jason began a 2-year break up. Jake's paternity is revealed to Lucky, but they agree to let Lucky be the father. Jason and Elizabeth start dating and get engaged, but when Michael is shot and left in a coma, Jason breaks up with Elizabeth. Jason ends up taking over Sonny's business after Sonny decides to leave the mob since it's too dangerous to his family. Sonny tries to rejoin the mob, but Jason prevents him access. Sonny tries to regain his power by marrying [[Claudia Zacchara]] ([[Sarah Joy Brown]]), daughter of rival mob boss [[Anthony Zacchara]] ([[Bruce Weitz]]).\n\nWhen Jason's friend and trusted associate [[Damian Spinelli]] ([[Bradford Anderson]]) is set up and arrested for his illegal activities, Jason is forced to agree to a deal to gain Spinelli's freedom by getting Anthony arrested. The feds renege on their promise, and make Jason get Sonny arrested too, which Jason refuses. Spinelli is freed when Sam helps Jason destroy the evidence against him. Jason and Sonny reconcile, and Jason gives the business back. Michael wakes up from his year-long coma, and Jason suspects that Claudia is responsible for Michael's shooting. When Michael and [[Kristina Davis]] ([[Lexi Ainsworth]]) run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason track the siblings, but encounter [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]). Jason is shot and left to die by Jerry. Sam rescues Jason, and cares for him; the two reconnect. Jason and Sam find Michael and Kristina, and bring them back to Port Charles. He and Sam start dating again as lovers for the first time in 2 years. Jason and Sam find the proof they need to confirm Claudia's involvement in Michael's shooting. They hand it over to Sonny, who confronts Claudia. Cornered, Claudia takes a pregnant Carly hostage, and escapes. Michael ends up finding them before Jason & Sam can, and kills Claudia to protect Carly and his baby sister, [[Josslyn Jacks]]. To protect Michael, Jason covers up the crime and makes it look like Claudia disappeared.\n\n===2010s===\nJason is stalked by obsessed artist [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] ([[James Franco]]), who exposes Claudia's murder and gets Michael sent to prison. Jason makes a deal to go to prison to protect Michael, but they are both eventually released. After Jake dies in an accident, a grief-stricken Jason realizes how much he wants a family, and proposes to Sam; they get engaged, and marry soon after. During their honeymoon in Hawaii, Sam and Jason are drugged by Franco. He locks Jason in a room, and forces him to watch as he apparently rapes Sam. After returning to Port Charles, Jason kills Franco, but Sam finds out she's pregnant. A paternity test establishes Jason as the father. However, Sam is led to believe that Franco is Jason's fraternal twin brother. Another DNA test shows that Franco is the father, and Jason has a hard time accepting the news, separating the couple. Jason eventually tries to make amends with Sam the same night she gives birth to a baby boy, but they are led to believe her son died, and mourn the baby's death. Unknown to either, Sam's son was actually switched by [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] ([[Robin Mattson]]) and [[Todd Manning]] ([[Roger Howarth]]) with the stillborn [[Victor Lord III]]. It's also revealed that Jason is the baby's father because Heather switched the paternity test. The baby's \"death\" causes Jason and Sam's marriage to deteriorate, and they agree to divorce. Jason eventually figures out that the baby that died wasn't Sam's. He and Sam are eventually reunited with their son, whom they name [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Edward Morgan]]. That night, Jason is shot by [[Cesar Faison]] ([[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]]), who kicks him into the water; Jason is presumed dead. Not long after he disappears, Sam finds out Jason is Danny's biological father.\n\nAlmost two years later, Jason was revealed to be alive, being held captive by [[Victor Cassadine]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]). Victor gets Robin to revive Jason, then has him locked up to use his abilities. Jason manages to escape, only to be hit by a car. He is brought to General Hospital, and has multiple reconstructive surgeries to his face. Jason ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) wakes up with amnesia, and is tended to by Elizabeth. He believes his name to be Jake. [[Helena Cassadine]] ([[Constance Towers]]) uses \"Jake\" through mind control to carry out her sinister plans. In the meantime, he and Elizabeth grow closer. When Jason is caught for his crimes, they find a chip inside his head that Helena uses to control him. Jason undergoes surgery to remove the chip, but still can't remember his real identity. Soon after, [[Hayden Barnes]] ([[Rebecca Budig]]) arrives, claiming to be \"Jake's\" wife, but she is exposed as a fraud. Elizabeth learns \"Jake\"'s identity, but keeps it a secret to pursue a relationship with Jason. Elizabeth and Jason's son, Jake, is found alive and being held captive by Helena. He is rescued, and returned to Elizabeth & Jason. \"Jake\" proposes to Elizabeth, and she accepts. He asks Sam for help to figure out his real identity. Spinelli and Carly figure out \"Jake\" is actually Jason. \"Jake\" finds out his true identity on his wedding day. Jason still can't remember his past, and decides to divorce Sam so he can marry Elizabeth. Sam figures out that Elizabeth knew who Jason was, and tells him. Heartbroken over her deception, Jason breaks up with Elizabeth.\n\nWhile dealing with Jake's anger over his father leaving, Jason grows closer to Sam, and the two slowly start to rebuild their relationship. When Jake is almost hit by a car and Jason saves Sam from an explosion, the two eventually agree to start over. Sam asks Jason for a divorce, though, hoping to not pressure Jason into remembering their past. Jason reluctantly agrees. Soon after, Jason is in an accident, and ends up saving [[Dante Falconeri]]'s ([[Dominic Zamprogna]]) life. While trying to rescue Dante, he starts having visions of Robin, Carly, Helena, Sam, and Sonny. Jason's memory finally returns, and he reconnects with his family and friends; despite reconnecting with Sonny, Jason decides not to go back into the mob for the sake of his family. Jason goes on the run with Sam when he is accused of murder. They find the evidence to clear Jason's name, and return to Port Charles. After returning, Sam found out that she was pregnant, and Jason was ecstatic; he proposed to Sam, and they remarried soon after. Jason investigated the car bombing that killed [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]), Sonny and Carly's son, in an attempt to clear Sonny's name. He teams up with [[Curtis Ashford]] ([[Donnell Turner]]), and they figure out the culprit was [[Olivia St. John]] ([[Tonja Walker]]), who was trying to kill [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]). Jason ends up rescuing Sam after Olivia kidnaps her. Sam goes into labor, and Jason is forced to deliver their daughter, [[Children of General Hospital#Scout Cain|Emily Scout Morgan]].\n\nJason tries to help Sonny leave the mob, but ends up getting shot in an ambush. He goes into a coma for several weeks. At the same time, a man known as \"Patient 6\" (Burton) is seen in Russia with Jason's original face. Patient 6 makes his way back to Port Charles, just as Jason wakes up. Patient 6 claims to be Jason, and is eventually believed to be the real Jason by many. Franco, proven to not be Jason's twin brother, reveals that Jason did have a twin brother named Andrew, but they do not know where he is. It's revealed that [[Andre Maddox]] ([[Anthony Montgomery]]) used Jason and Andrew as part of a memory-mapping experiment, putting Jason's memories into Andrew, making them both believe they're Jason. Andre reveals that Patient 6 is Jason, and the \"other Jason\" is his twin brother, [[Drew Cain]]. Jason decides to find Faison, in hopes of figuring out why he and Drew were abducted. Meanwhile, he and Sam file for divorce, as she decides to stay with Drew.  On January 22, 2018, Jason was fighting for Sam, in order to stop the wedding, but it was to late when she married Drew.  In March 2018, during an earthquake that started shaking, Jason and Sam hide safely.  Then in the aftermath of the quake, Jason and Sam developed feelings for each other.  By March 23, 2018, she told her husband, Drew that she had feelings and love for Jason, her ex-husband, that had her break up with Drew, who moved out of her penthouse.\n\n==Reception==\nBurton's portrayal of Jason Morgan earned him two [[Soap Opera Digest Awards]] for Outstanding Younger Lead Actor in 1997 and 1998.<ref name=\"1997 Awards\">{{cite news|title='General Hospital' wins Soap Opera awards|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qo4NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BHADAAAAIBAJ&dq=13th%20soap%20opera%20digest%20awards&pg=6877%2C175987|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 1, 1997}}</ref><ref name=\"1998 Awards\">{{cite news|title='General Hospital' tops in soap opera awards|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_tNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dG8DAAAAIBAJ&dq=14th%20soap%20opera%20digest%20awards&pg=6703%2C3292551|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 3, 1998|agency=Associated Press|author-link = Associated Press}}</ref> He was nominated for the 1997 [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series]] and won the 1998 [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]].
