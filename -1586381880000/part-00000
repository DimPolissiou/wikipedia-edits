In around 635 AD, the Irish missionary [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] founded the Lindisfarne monastery on \"a small outcrop of land\" on Lindisfarne.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 7\">Backhouse 1981, 7.</ref> King [[Oswald of Northumbria]] sent Aidan from [[Iona]] to preach to and baptise the pagan [[Anglo-Saxons]], following the conversion to Christianity of the Northumbrian monarchy in 627. By the time of Aidan's death in 651, the Christian faith was becoming well-established in the area.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 8\">Backhouse 1981, 8.</ref> The Lindisfarne gospel book is associated with the Cult of St. Cuthbert. Cuthbert was an ascetic member of a monastic community in Lindisfarne, before his death in 687. The book was made as part of the preparations to translate Cuthbert\u2019s relics to a shrine in 698. Lindisfarne has a reputation as the probable place of genesis according to the Lindisfarne Gospels. Around 705 an anonymous monk of Lindisfarne wrote the ''Life of St Cuthbert''. His bishop, Eadfrith, swiftly commissioned the most famous scholar of the age, Bede, to help shape the cult to a new purpose.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & the Scribe|last=Brown|first=Michelle|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=London, The British Library|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, about 250 years after the production of the book, Aldred, a priest of the monastery at [[Chester-le-Street]], added an [[Old English]] translation between the lines of the Latin text. In his [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] he recorded the names of the four men who produced the Lindisfarne Gospels:<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 7\"/> [[Eadfrith]], [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], was credited with writing the manuscript; Ethelwald, Bishop of the Lindisfarne islanders, was credited with binding it; [[Billfrith]], an [[anchorite]], was credited with ornamenting the manuscript; and finally Aldred lists himself as the person who glossed it in Anglo-Saxon (Old English).<ref>Backhouse 1981, 12.</ref> \n\nSome scholars have argued that Eadfrith and Ethelwald did not produce the manuscript but commissioned someone else to do so.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 13.</ref> However, Janet Backhouse argues for the validity of the statement by pointing out that \"there is no reason to doubt [Aldred's] statement\" because he was \"recording a well established tradition\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 7\"/> Eadfrith and Ethelwald were both bishops at the monastery of Lindisfarne where the manuscript was produced. As Alan Thacker notes, the Lindisfarne Gospels are \"undoubtedly the work of a single hand\", and Eadfrith remains regarded as \"the scribe and painter of the Lindisfarne Gospels\".<ref>Thacker 2004.</ref>\n\n===Commission===\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels is a Christian manuscript, containing the four [[gospel]]s recounting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The manuscript was used for ceremonial purposes to promote and celebrate the Christian religion and the word of God.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because the body of Cuthbert was buried there, Lindisfarne became an important pilgrimage destination in the 7th and 8th centuries, and the Lindisfarne Gospels would have contributed to the cult of St Cuthbert.<ref name=\":0\" />  The gospels used techniques reminiscent of elite metalwork to impress a [[Northumbria]]n audience, most of whom could not read, and certainly not understand the Latin text.\n\nAccording to Aldred's colophon, the Lindisfarne Gospels were made in honour of God and Saint [[Cuthbert]], a Bishop of the Lindisfarne monastery who was becoming \"Northern England's most popular Saint\".<ref>Backhouse 1981, 7; Chilvers 2004.</ref> Scholars think that the manuscript was written sometime between Cuthbert's death in 687 and Eadfrith's death in 721.<ref name=\":0\">BBC Tyne 2012</ref> There is a significant amount of information known about Cuthbert thanks to two accounts of his life that were written shortly after his death, the first by an anonymous monk from Lindisfarne, and the second by [[Bede]], a famous monk, historian, and theologian.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 8\"/>\n\nCuthbert entered into the monastery of [[Old Melrose|Melrose]], now in lowland Scotland but then in [[Northumbria]], in the late 7th century, and after being ordained a priest he began to travel throughout Northumbria, \"rapidly acquiring a reputation for holiness and for the possession of miraculous powers\".<ref>Backhouse 1981, 8\u20139.</ref> The [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664 pitted the Hiberno-Celtic church against the Roman church regarding the calculation of the date of Easter. The dispute was adjudged by King [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in favour of the Roman church, but many of the leading monks at Lindisfarne then returned to Iona and Ireland, leaving only a residue of monks affiliated to the Roman church at Lindisfarne. Due to increasingly slack religious practice in Lindisfarne, Cuthbert was sent to Lindisfarne to reform the religious community.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 9\">Backhouse 1981, 9.</ref> In Lindisfarne Cuthbert began to adopt a solitary lifestyle, eventually moving to [[Inner Farne]] Island, where he built a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]].<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 9\"/> Cuthbert agreed to become bishop at the request of King [[Ecgfrith]] in 684, but within about two years he returned to his hermitage in Farne as he felt death approaching.

The colours are derived from animal, vegetable and mineral sources.<ref name=\"Backhouse 2004\">Backhouse 2004.</ref> While some colours were obtained from local sources, others were imported from the Mediterranean, and rare pigments such as [[lapis lazuli]] would have come from the Himalayas.<ref name=\"Backhouse 2004\"/> Gold is used in only a couple of small details.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/> The medium used to bind the colours was primarily egg white, with fish glue perhaps used in a few places.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/> Backhouse emphasizes that \"all Eadfrith's colours are applied with great skill and accuracy, but ... we have no means of knowing exactly what implements he used\". Professor Brown added that Eadfrith \" knew about lapis lazuli [a semi-precious stone with a blue tint] from the Himalayas but could not get hold of it, so made his own\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/>\n\nThe pages were arranged into [[Gathering (bookbinding)|gatherings]] of eight. Once the sheets had been folded together, the highest numbered page was carefully marked out by pricking with a stylus or a small knife.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 28\"/> Holes were pricked through each gathering of eight leaves, and then individual pages were separately ruled for writing with a sharp, dry, and discreet point.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 28\"/>\n\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are impeccably designed, and as Backhouse points out, vellum would have been too expensive for \"practice runs\" for the pages, and so preliminary designs may have been done on [[wax tablet]]s (hollowed-out wood or bone with a layer of wax).<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 31\">Backhouse 1981, 31.</ref> These would have been an inexpensive medium for a first draft; once a sketch had been transferred to the manuscript, the wax could be remelted and a new design or outline inscribed.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 31\"/>\n\n==History==\nDue to Viking raids, the monastic community left Lindisfarne around 875, taking with them Cuthbert's body, relics, and books, including the Lindisfarne Gospels<ref name=\":0\" /> and the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]]. It is estimated that after around seven years the Lindisfarne community settled in the Priory at Chester-le-Street in Durham, where they stayed until 995 (and where Aldred would have done his interlinear translation of the text).<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\">Backhouse, 2004</ref> After Henry VIII ordered the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, the manuscript was separated from the priory.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/> In the early 17th century the Gospels were owned by Sir [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]] (1571\u20131631), and in 1753 they became part of the founding collections of the British Museum.<ref>Chilvers 2004</ref>\n\n===Condition===\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are in remarkable condition and the text is complete and undamaged.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\">Backhouse 1981, 66</ref> However, the original binding of the manuscript was destroyed. In March 1852 a new binding was commissioned by bishop [[Edward Maltby]]; Smith, Nicholson and Co. (silversmiths) made the binding with the intention of recreating motifs in Eadfrith's work.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 90</ref>\n\n==Formal and stylistic elements of the manuscript==\n[[File:Lindisfarne Gospels folio 139r.jpg|thumb|[[Gospel of Luke]]]]\nIn ''The Illuminated Manuscript'', Backhouse states that \"The Lindisfarne Gospels is one of the first and greatest masterpieces of medieval European book painting\".<ref>Backhouse 1979, 10</ref> The Lindisfarne Gospels is described as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon art, a general term for manuscripts produced in the British Isles between 500\u2013900 AD.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>\n\nAs a part of Anglo-Saxon art the manuscript reveals a love of riddles and surprise, shown through the pattern and interlace in the meticulously designed pages. Many of the patterns used for the Lindisfarne Gospels date back before the Christian period.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 47\">Backhouse 1981, 47</ref> There is a strong presence of Celtic, Germanic, and Irish art styles. The spiral style and \u201cknot work\u201d evident in the formation of the designed pages are influenced by Celtic art.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 47\"/>\n\nOne of the most characteristic styles in the manuscript is the [[zoomorphic style]] (adopted from Germanic art) and is revealed through the extensive use of interlaced animal and bird patterns throughout the book.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 47\"/> The birds that appear in the manuscript may also have been from Eadfrith's own observations of wildlife in Lindisfarne.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/> The geometric design motifs are also Germanic influence, and appear throughout the manuscript.\n\nThe [[carpet page]]s (pages of pure decoration) exemplify Eadfrith's use of geometrical ornamentation. Another notable aspect of the Gospels is the tiny drops of red lead, which create backgrounds, outlines, and patterns, but never appear on the carpet pages.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 51\">Backhouse 1981, 51</ref> The red dots appear in early Irish manuscripts, revealing their influence in the design of the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 51\"/> Thacker points out that Eadfrith acquired knowledge from, and was influenced by, other artistic styles, showing that he had \"eclectic taste\".<ref name=\"Thacker 2004\">Thacker 2004</ref> While there are many non-Christian artistic influences in the manuscript, the patterns were used to produce religious motifs and ideas.\n\n===The script===\nEadfrith was a highly trained calligrapher and he used insular [[majuscule]] script in the manuscript.<ref name=\"Thacker 2004\"/>\n\n===Other insular works of art===\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are not an example of \"isolated genius... in an otherwise dark age\":<ref>Backhouse 1981, 62</ref> there were other Gospel books produced in the same time period and geographic area that have similar qualities to the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Lindisfarne monastery not only produced the Lindisfarne gospels, but the Durham Gospels and Echternach Gospels as well. These gospel books were credited to \u201cthe \u2018Durnham-Echternach Calligrapher\u2019, thought to be the oldest member of the Lindisfarne Scriptorium\u201d.<ref>Brown, Michelle P., ''The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & the Scribe.'' London: The British Library, 2003.</ref> The Echternach gospels are might have been made during the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Durham Gospels came after, but in an old-fashioned style.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & the Scribe|last=Brown|first=Michelle|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> The [[Gospels of Saint Chad]] (Lichfield Cathedral, Chapter Library) employ a very similar style to the Lindisfarne Gospels, and it is even speculated that the artist was attempting to emulate Eadfrith's work.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\"/> Surviving pages from the Gospels of Saint Chad also have a cross-carpet page and animal and bird interlace, but the designs do not achieve the same perfection, and are seen as looser and heavier than Eadfrith's.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\"/> The design of the Lindisfarne Gospels has also been related to the [[Tara Brooch]] (National Museum of Ireland, Dublin), displaying animal interlace, curvilinear patterns, and borders of bird interlace, but unfortunately the origin and place{{clarifyme|date=June 2017}} of the brooch are unknown.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\"/> The Durham Gospels ([[Durham Dean and Chapter Library|Durham Cathedral Library]]) are suspected as having been created slightly earlier than the Lindisfarne Gospels, and while they have the bird interlace, the birds are less natural and real than Eadfrith's birds in the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 67</ref> The [[Book of Durrow]] (Trinity College, Dublin) is also thought of as an earlier insular manuscript, as the style of the manuscript is simpler and less developed than that of the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 75</ref> The [[Book of Kells]] (Trinity College, Dublin, MS A. I.6 (58)) employs decorative patterns that are similar to other insular art pieces of the period, but is thought to have been produced much later than the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 41</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 001.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew the Evangelist]]]]\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels is a manuscript that contains the Gospels of the four Evangelists Mark, John, Luke, and Matthew. The Lindisfarne Gospels begins with a [[carpet page]] in the form of a cross and a major initial page, introducing the letter of [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] and [[Pope Damasus I]].<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>  There are sixteen pages of arcaded [[canon tables]], where parallel passages of the four Evangelists are laid out.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 41; Backhouse 2004</ref> A portrait of the appropriate Evangelist, a carpet page and a decorated initial page precedes each Gospel. There is an additional major initial of the Christmas narrative of Matthew.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>\n\n===The Evangelists===\n[[Bede]] explains how each of the four Evangelists was represented by their own symbol: Matthew was the man, representing the human Christ; Mark was the lion, symbolising the triumphant Christ of the Resurrection; Luke was the calf, symbolising the sacrificial victim of the Crucifixion; and John was the eagle, symbolising Christ's second coming.<ref name=\"blboard\">The British Library Board, [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/lindisfarne/overview.html \u201cThe Lindisfarne Gospels Tour.\u201d] Accessed 13 March 2012.</ref> A collective term for the symbols of the four Evangelists is the [[Tetramorph]]s. Each of the four Evangelists is accompanied by their respective symbol in their miniature portraits in the manuscript. In these portraits, Matthew, Mark, and Luke are shown writing, while John looks straight ahead at the reader holding his scroll.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> The Evangelists also represent the dual nature of Christ. Mark and John are shown as young men, symbolising the divine nature of Christ, and Matthew and Luke appear older and bearded, representing Christ's mortal nature.<ref name=\"blboard\"/>\n\n===The decoration of the manuscript===\nA manuscript so richly decorated reveals that the Lindisfarne Gospels not only had a practical ceremonial use, but also attempted to symbolize the Word of God in missionary expeditions.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 33\">Backhouse 1981, 33</ref> Backhouse points out that the clergy was not unaware of the profound impression a book such as the Lindisfarne Gospels made on other congregations.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 33\"/> The opening words of the Gospel (the incipits) are highly decorated, revealing Roman capitals, Greek and Germanic letters, filled with interlaced birds and beasts, representing the splendour of God\u2019s creation.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> On one page alone, there are 10,600 decorative red dots. <ref>Consiglio, Flavia Di. \u201cLindisfarne Gospels: Why Is This Book so Special?\u201d BBC News, BBC, 20 Mar. 2013, www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/21588667.</ref> Different kinds of pigment are used throughout the manuscript. <ref name=\"Backhouse 2004\"/> Red lead and gold were also used for decoration. <ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/> <ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 51\"/>\n\n===The carpet pages===\n[[File:F26v.jpg|thumb|[[Carpet page]], F26v]]\nThe [[carpet page]]s are influenced by early [[Copts|Coptic]] (Christian Egyptian) manuscripts in their resemblance to Islamic prayer rugs, which were probably known during this time in Northumbria.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> Just as the rugs helped worshippers prepare for prayer, the carpet pages can represent the preparation of the reader before the Gospel message.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> Each carpet page contains a different image of a cross (called a cross-carpet page), emphasising the importance of the Christian religion and of ecumenical relationships between churches.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> The pages of ornamentation have motifs familiar from metalwork and jewellery that pair alongside bird and animal decoration<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>\n\n==Campaign to relocate==\nA campaign exists to have the gospels housed in the North East of England.

In around 635 AD, the Irish missionary [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] founded the Lindisfarne monastery on \"a small outcrop of land\" on Lindisfarne.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 7\">Backhouse 1981, 7.</ref> King [[Oswald of Northumbria]] sent Aidan from [[Iona]] to preach to and baptise the pagan [[Anglo-Saxons]], following the conversion to Christianity of the Northumbrian monarchy in 627. By the time of Aidan's death in 651, the Christian faith was becoming well-established in the area.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 8\">Backhouse 1981, 8.</ref> The Lindisfarne gospel book is associated with the Cult of St. Cuthbert. Cuthbert was an ascetic member of a monastic community in Lindisfarne, before his death in 687. The book was made as part of the preparations to translate Cuthbert\u2019s relics to a shrine in 698. Lindisfarne has a reputation as the probable place of genesis according to the Lindisfarne Gospels. Around 705 an anonymous monk of Lindisfarne wrote the ''Life of St Cuthbert''. His bishop, Eadfrith, swiftly commissioned the most famous scholar of the age, Bede, to help shape the cult to a new purpose.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & the Scribe|last=Brown|first=Michelle|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=London, The British Library|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, about 250 years after the production of the book, Aldred, a priest of the monastery at [[Chester-le-Street]], added an [[Old English]] translation between the lines of the Latin text. In his [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] he recorded the names of the four men who produced the Lindisfarne Gospels:<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 7\"/> [[Eadfrith]], [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], was credited with writing the manuscript; Ethelwald, Bishop of the Lindisfarne islanders, was credited with binding it; [[Billfrith]], an [[anchorite]], was credited with ornamenting the manuscript; and finally Aldred lists himself as the person who glossed it in Anglo-Saxon (Old English).<ref>Backhouse 1981, 12.</ref> \n\nSome scholars have argued that Eadfrith and Ethelwald did not produce the manuscript but commissioned someone else to do so.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 13.</ref> However, Janet Backhouse argues for the validity of the statement by pointing out that \"there is no reason to doubt [Aldred's] statement\" because he was \"recording a well established tradition\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 7\"/> Eadfrith and Ethelwald were both bishops at the monastery of Lindisfarne where the manuscript was produced. As Alan Thacker notes, the Lindisfarne Gospels are \"undoubtedly the work of a single hand\", and Eadfrith remains regarded as \"the scribe and painter of the Lindisfarne Gospels\".<ref>Thacker 2004.</ref>\n\n===Commission===\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels is a Christian manuscript, containing the four [[gospel]]s recounting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The manuscript was used for ceremonial purposes to promote and celebrate the Christian religion and the word of God.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because the body of Cuthbert was buried there, Lindisfarne became an important pilgrimage destination in the 7th and 8th centuries, and the Lindisfarne Gospels would have contributed to the cult of St Cuthbert.<ref name=\":0\" />  The gospels used techniques reminiscent of elite metalwork to impress a [[Northumbria]]n audience, most of whom could not read, and certainly not understand the Latin text.\n\nAccording to Aldred's colophon, the Lindisfarne Gospels were made in honour of God and Saint [[Cuthbert]], a Bishop of the Lindisfarne monastery who was becoming \"Northern England's most popular Saint\".<ref>Backhouse 1981, 7; Chilvers 2004.</ref> Scholars think that the manuscript was written sometime between Cuthbert's death in 687 and Eadfrith's death in 721.<ref name=\":0\">BBC Tyne 2012</ref> There is a significant amount of information known about Cuthbert thanks to two accounts of his life that were written shortly after his death, the first by an anonymous monk from Lindisfarne, and the second by [[Bede]], a famous monk, historian, and theologian.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 8\"/>\n\nCuthbert entered into the monastery of [[Old Melrose|Melrose]], now in lowland Scotland but then in [[Northumbria]], in the late 7th century, and after being ordained a priest he began to travel throughout Northumbria, \"rapidly acquiring a reputation for holiness and for the possession of miraculous powers\".<ref>Backhouse 1981, 8\u20139.</ref> The [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664 pitted the Hiberno-Celtic church against the Roman church regarding the calculation of the date of Easter. The dispute was adjudged by King [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in favour of the Roman church, but many of the leading monks at Lindisfarne then returned to Iona and Ireland, leaving only a residue of monks affiliated to the Roman church at Lindisfarne. Due to increasingly slack religious practice in Lindisfarne, Cuthbert was sent to Lindisfarne to reform the religious community.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 9\">Backhouse 1981, 9.</ref> In Lindisfarne Cuthbert began to adopt a solitary lifestyle, eventually moving to [[Inner Farne]] Island, where he built a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]].<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 9\"/> Cuthbert agreed to become bishop at the request of King [[Ecgfrith]] in 684, but within about two years he returned to his hermitage in Farne as he felt death approaching.

The colours are derived from animal, vegetable and mineral sources.<ref name=\"Backhouse 2004\">Backhouse 2004.</ref> While some colours were obtained from local sources, others were imported from the Mediterranean, and rare pigments such as [[lapis lazuli]] would have come from the Himalayas.<ref name=\"Backhouse 2004\"/> Gold is used in only a couple of small details.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/> The medium used to bind the colours was primarily egg white, with fish glue perhaps used in a few places.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/> Backhouse emphasizes that \"all Eadfrith's colours are applied with great skill and accuracy, but ... we have no means of knowing exactly what implements he used\". Professor Brown added that Eadfrith \" knew about lapis lazuli [a semi-precious stone with a blue tint] from the Himalayas but could not get hold of it, so made his own\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/>\n\nThe pages were arranged into [[Gathering (bookbinding)|gatherings]] of eight. Once the sheets had been folded together, the highest numbered page was carefully marked out by pricking with a stylus or a small knife.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 28\"/> Holes were pricked through each gathering of eight leaves, and then individual pages were separately ruled for writing with a sharp, dry, and discreet point.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 28\"/>\n\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are impeccably designed, and as Backhouse points out, vellum would have been too expensive for \"practice runs\" for the pages, and so preliminary designs may have been done on [[wax tablet]]s (hollowed-out wood or bone with a layer of wax).<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 31\">Backhouse 1981, 31.</ref> These would have been an inexpensive medium for a first draft; once a sketch had been transferred to the manuscript, the wax could be remelted and a new design or outline inscribed.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 31\"/>\n\n==History==\nDue to Viking raids, the monastic community left Lindisfarne around 875, taking with them Cuthbert's body, relics, and books, including the Lindisfarne Gospels<ref name=\":0\" /> and the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]]. It is estimated that after around seven years the Lindisfarne community settled in the Priory at Chester-le-Street in Durham, where they stayed until 995 (and where Aldred would have done his interlinear translation of the text).<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\">Backhouse, 2004</ref> After Henry VIII ordered the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, the manuscript was separated from the priory.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/> In the early 17th century the Gospels were owned by Sir [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]] (1571\u20131631), and in 1753 they became part of the founding collections of the British Museum.<ref>Chilvers 2004</ref>\n\n===Condition===\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are in remarkable condition and the text is complete and undamaged.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\">Backhouse 1981, 66</ref> However, the original binding of the manuscript was destroyed. In March 1852 a new binding was commissioned by bishop [[Edward Maltby]]; Smith, Nicholson and Co. (silversmiths) made the binding with the intention of recreating motifs in Eadfrith's work.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 90</ref>\n\n==Formal and stylistic elements of the manuscript==\n[[File:Lindisfarne Gospels folio 139r.jpg|thumb|[[Gospel of Luke]]]]\nIn ''The Illuminated Manuscript'', Backhouse states that \"The Lindisfarne Gospels is one of the first and greatest masterpieces of medieval European book painting\".<ref>Backhouse 1979, 10</ref> The Lindisfarne Gospels is described as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon art, a general term for manuscripts produced in the British Isles between 500\u2013900 AD.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>\n\nAs a part of Anglo-Saxon art the manuscript reveals a love of riddles and surprise, shown through the pattern and interlace in the meticulously designed pages. Many of the patterns used for the Lindisfarne Gospels date back before the Christian period.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 47\">Backhouse 1981, 47</ref> There is a strong presence of Celtic, Germanic, and Irish art styles. The spiral style and \u201cknot work\u201d evident in the formation of the designed pages are influenced by Celtic art.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 47\"/>\n\nOne of the most characteristic styles in the manuscript is the [[zoomorphic style]] (adopted from Germanic art) and is revealed through the extensive use of interlaced animal and bird patterns throughout the book.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 47\"/> The birds that appear in the manuscript may also have been from Eadfrith's own observations of wildlife in Lindisfarne.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/> The geometric design motifs are also Germanic influence, and appear throughout the manuscript.\n\nThe [[carpet page]]s (pages of pure decoration) exemplify Eadfrith's use of geometrical ornamentation. Another notable aspect of the Gospels is the tiny drops of red lead, which create backgrounds, outlines, and patterns, but never appear on the carpet pages.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 51\">Backhouse 1981, 51</ref> The red dots appear in early Irish manuscripts, revealing their influence in the design of the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 51\"/> Thacker points out that Eadfrith acquired knowledge from, and was influenced by, other artistic styles, showing that he had \"eclectic taste\".<ref name=\"Thacker 2004\">Thacker 2004</ref> While there are many non-Christian artistic influences in the manuscript, the patterns were used to produce religious motifs and ideas.\n\n===The script===\nEadfrith was a highly trained calligrapher and he used insular [[majuscule]] script in the manuscript.<ref name=\"Thacker 2004\"/>\n\n===Other insular works of art===\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are not an example of \"isolated genius... in an otherwise dark age\":<ref>Backhouse 1981, 62</ref> there were other Gospel books produced in the same time period and geographic area that have similar qualities to the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Lindisfarne monastery not only produced the Lindisfarne gospels, but the Durham Gospels and Echternach Gospels as well. These gospel books were credited to \u201cthe \u2018Durnham-Echternach Calligrapher\u2019, thought to be the oldest member of the Lindisfarne Scriptorium\u201d.<ref>Brown, Michelle P., ''The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & the Scribe.'' London: The British Library, 2003.</ref> The Echternach gospels are might have been made during the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Durham Gospels came after, but in an old-fashioned style.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & the Scribe|last=Brown|first=Michelle|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> The [[Gospels of Saint Chad]] (Lichfield Cathedral, Chapter Library) employ a very similar style to the Lindisfarne Gospels, and it is even speculated that the artist was attempting to emulate Eadfrith's work.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\"/> Surviving pages from the Gospels of Saint Chad also have a cross-carpet page and animal and bird interlace, but the designs do not achieve the same perfection, and are seen as looser and heavier than Eadfrith's.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\"/> The design of the Lindisfarne Gospels has also been related to the [[Tara Brooch]] (National Museum of Ireland, Dublin), displaying animal interlace, curvilinear patterns, and borders of bird interlace, but unfortunately the origin and place{{clarifyme|date=June 2017}} of the brooch are unknown.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 66\"/> The Durham Gospels ([[Durham Dean and Chapter Library|Durham Cathedral Library]]) are suspected as having been created slightly earlier than the Lindisfarne Gospels, and while they have the bird interlace, the birds are less natural and real than Eadfrith's birds in the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 67</ref> The [[Book of Durrow]] (Trinity College, Dublin) is also thought of as an earlier insular manuscript, as the style of the manuscript is simpler and less developed than that of the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 75</ref> The [[Book of Kells]] (Trinity College, Dublin, MS A. I.6 (58)) employs decorative patterns that are similar to other insular art pieces of the period, but is thought to have been produced much later than the Lindisfarne Gospels.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 41</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 001.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew the Evangelist]]]]\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels is a manuscript that contains the Gospels of the four Evangelists Mark, John, Luke, and Matthew. The Lindisfarne Gospels begins with a [[carpet page]] in the form of a cross and a major initial page, introducing the letter of [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] and [[Pope Damasus I]].<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>  There are sixteen pages of arcaded [[canon tables]], where parallel passages of the four Evangelists are laid out.<ref>Backhouse 1981, 41; Backhouse 2004</ref> A portrait of the appropriate Evangelist, a carpet page and a decorated initial page precedes each Gospel. There is an additional major initial of the Christmas narrative of Matthew.<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>\n\n===The Evangelists===\n[[Bede]] explains how each of the four Evangelists was represented by their own symbol: Matthew was the man, representing the human Christ; Mark was the lion, symbolising the triumphant Christ of the Resurrection; Luke was the calf, symbolising the sacrificial victim of the Crucifixion; and John was the eagle, symbolising Christ's second coming.<ref name=\"blboard\">The British Library Board, [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/lindisfarne/overview.html \u201cThe Lindisfarne Gospels Tour.\u201d] Accessed 13 March 2012.</ref> A collective term for the symbols of the four Evangelists is the [[Tetramorph]]s. Each of the four Evangelists is accompanied by their respective symbol in their miniature portraits in the manuscript. In these portraits, Matthew, Mark, and Luke are shown writing, while John looks straight ahead at the reader holding his scroll.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> The Evangelists also represent the dual nature of Christ. Mark and John are shown as young men, symbolising the divine nature of Christ, and Matthew and Luke appear older and bearded, representing Christ's mortal nature.<ref name=\"blboard\"/>\n\n===The decoration of the manuscript===\nA manuscript so richly decorated reveals that the Lindisfarne Gospels not only had a practical ceremonial use, but also attempted to symbolize the Word of God in missionary expeditions.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 33\">Backhouse 1981, 33</ref> Backhouse points out that the clergy was not unaware of the profound impression a book such as the Lindisfarne Gospels made on other congregations.<ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 33\"/> The opening words of the Gospel (the incipits) are highly decorated, revealing Roman capitals, Greek and Germanic letters, filled with interlaced birds and beasts, representing the splendour of God\u2019s creation.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> On one page alone, there are 10,600 decorative red dots. <ref>Consiglio, Flavia Di. \u201cLindisfarne Gospels: Why Is This Book so Special?\u201d BBC News, BBC, 20 Mar. 2013, www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/21588667.</ref> Different kinds of pigment are used throughout the manuscript. <ref name=\"Backhouse 2004\"/> Red lead and gold were also used for decoration. <ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 32\"/> <ref name=\"Backhouse 1981, 51\"/>\n\n===The carpet pages===\n[[File:F26v.jpg|thumb|[[Carpet page]], F26v]]\nThe carpet pages are influenced by early [[Copts|Coptic]] (Christian Egyptian) manuscripts in their resemblance to Islamic prayer rugs, which were probably known during this time in Northumbria.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> Just as the rugs helped worshippers prepare for prayer, the carpet pages can represent the preparation of the reader before the Gospel message.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> Each carpet page contains a different image of a cross (called a cross-carpet page), emphasising the importance of the Christian religion and of ecumenical relationships between churches.<ref name=\"blboard\"/> The pages of ornamentation have motifs familiar from metalwork and jewellery that pair alongside bird and animal decoration<ref name=\"Backhouse-04\"/>\n\n==Campaign to relocate==\nA campaign exists to have the gospels housed in the North East of England. Supporters include the [[Bishop of Durham]], [[Viz (comics)|Viz]] creator [[Simon Donald]], and the Northumbrian Association.

At the reception ceremony, on 19 April 1909, Kosta Mileti\u0107 flew a spherical balloon called Srbija (''Serbia''). One balloon was provided from Russia. A gas chamber was ordered from the Dillmann company in Berlin, and a field winch from St Petersburg. A hydrogen unit was provided from the Swiss company Oerlikon. The equipment was delivered to Serbia in 1909 and 1910.\n\nThe first competition for cadet airmen in Serbia was opened in May 1911, and in the following year the first class of Serbian pilots started their flying training in France from 21 May to 8 September 1912 and got the rank of pilot. They finished the course in the beginning of the [[First Balkan War]] with aircraft and the [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] that had already been obtained prior to the outbreak of war.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA66|title=Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia: A-L|first=Walter J.|last=Boyne|date=1 January 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576073452|accessdate=18 January 2017|via=Google Books|p=66}}</ref> In the autumn of 1912, Serbia got the aircraft for its armed forces. On 24 December 1912 the head of the military ministry [[Radomir Putnik]] approved the formation of the Aviation Command situated in Ni\u0161; the commander was Major Kosta Mileti\u0107. It comprised: the Aircraft Squadron which counted 12 military aircraft, the Balloon Company, the [[pigeon post]] and the [[Airbase|Base]]. This date is regarded in Serbia as marking the official founding of the air force. This made [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] one of the first 15 states in the world to have an air force.\n\n===Balkan Wars===\n{{see also|Macedonian Struggle}}\n\nThe First Balkan War broke out in October 1912; Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia waged it against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In this war, the Serbian Aviation Command had its first combat experience. In February 1913, the High Command of Serbian Army formed an expeditionary Coastal Airplane Squadron in order to aid the Montenegrin ground force against Ottoman troops who were reinforced at the town of [[Skadar]] near the [[Adriatic]] coast. Air support for this formation was assigned to the newly established \"Coastal Airplane Squad\", the first Serbian air combat unit, with 4 airplanes ([[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] one-seater, Bl\u00e9riot XI two-seater, [[Deperdussin TT]] and [[Farman HF.20]]) and 5 pilots under the command of Major Kosta Mileti\u0107. In mid-March 1913, this combat air unit was relocated near the frontline at a newly built auxiliary airfield in the village of Barbalusi. The first [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance flight]] was made on 20 March (7 March, [[Old Style and New Style dates|oldstyle]]), by Lt. Zivojin Stankovi\u0107 and Sgt. Mihailo Petrovi\u0107. In this combat-reconnaissance flight on his Farman HF. 20 over the Skadar Front on 20 March 1913, Sgt. Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 was killed, thus becoming the first casualty in the history of the Serbian military aviation and the second one in world aviation history. Mihajlo Petrovi\u0107 was the first trained Serbian airplane pilot. He completed his training and exams at the famous Farman pilot school in France and was awarded the international FAI license no. 979 in June 1912. His Serbian pilot's license carries the number 1.<ref name=\"Miletic\"/> The next day, pilots Lt. Zivojin Stankovich and Sgt. [[Miodrag Tomi\u0107|Miodrag Tomich]] successfully completed their first reconnaissance flights, and in the following days, pilots Milos Ilic, Stankovich and Tomich dropped a number of small bombs and conducted reconnaissance flights. A fascinating fact represents that the pilot Tomich and [[Essad Pasha Toptani|Esad Pasha]], the former Turkish commander at the Skadar frontline, would meet in a completely different situation two years later, during the First World War, when pilot Tomich needed help.\n\nAfter Bulgaria attacked at Bregalnica in Serbia, the [[Second Balkan War]] began. The first reconnaissance mission had been performed by Miodrag Tomi\u0107, and after that Tomi\u0107 and Stankovi\u0107 took turns and during a period of a month and a half, as the war with Bulgarians lasted, the two airmen performed 21 reconnaissance missions, of which Tomi\u0107 did 14 flights. During one flight above [[Kriva Palanka]], Tomi\u0107 encountered a Bulgarian plane in the air, but neither one had weapons and they just greeted one another by hand waving.\n\n===World War I===\n{{see also|July crisis}}\n[[File:FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two men seated in a biplane, surrounded by technical personnel|2nd Lt.

The Aeroplane Escadre had only 9 aeroplanes of which 7 were in flying condition. Five planes and three pilots were relocated to the auxiliary airfield at Dabi\u0107a. From that airfield, Captain's \u017divojin Stankovi\u0107 and 2nd Lieutenant Miodrag Tomi\u0107 on 13 August 1914 commenced their first reconnaissance flights in the [[First World War|Great War]]. Tomi\u0107 took off from the airfield at Jevremovac on 27 August, at five o'clock in the afternoon. Above Mishar he encountered an enemy plane and they were quite close to each other. The enemy plane opened fire on Tomi\u0107, who did not expect this, but he avoided it with an appropriate and fast maneuver, so the plane did not sustain any hits. Fire was coming from a Parabellum. It was \u2013 probably \u2013 the first exchange of fire between aircraft in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PxGkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298&lpg=PA298&dq=miodrag%20tomi%C4%87%20serbian%20%20pilot#v=onepage|title=Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914|first=Prit|last=Buttar|date=20 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|isbn=9781782006480|accessdate=18 January 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Because of [[air superiority]] of the [[Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops|''K.u.K.

The French Escadrille held the frontline from Smederevo to Loznica, and the Serbian Escadre from Smederevo to Golubac. After the conquest of Serbia by the [[Central Powers]] in the autumn of 1915 and the great retreat of the Serbian army to the Greek island of [[Corfu]], the [[Salonica Front]] was formed. During the invasion on Serbia in October 1915, [[Manfred von Richthofen]] was commenced its first combat flight as a pilot. Also, in the autumn of 1915, the first [[medevac|medical transport]] of the wounded and sick in world aviation history was realized in Serbia. One of the ill soldiers in that first medical transport was [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik|Milan Stefanik]], a Czechoslovakian pilot-volunteer.<ref>''L'homme-vent'', special issue of ''L'Ami de P\u00e9zenas'', 2010</ref> In June 1916 the reconstituted Serbian army sailed from Corfu and joined the French and British at [[Salonika]]. At the Salonica Front line, with the support of the Allied force, the Serbian Aeroplane Escadre was reorganized. From mid-1916 to 1918 at the Serbian part of the new established frontline, 5 Escadrilles (N521, N522, N523, N524 and N525) were operated, and squadrons were staffed with most of French and Serbian personnel. These air force units were officially known as the ''A\u00e9ronautique de l'Arm\u00e9e Serbe'' or Serbian Army Air Service and were attached to the High Command of Serbian Army which was a part of Allied Macedonian Army or ''Arm\u00e9e de l'Orient''.<ref name=\"Boris Ciglic Autumn 2013\">{{cite book|title=Premier Serbian Fighters|date=Autumn 2013|publisher=[[Cross and Cockade|Cross and Cockade International Vol 44/3]]|isbn=|url=|author=Boris Ciglic}}</ref> It was commanded by a French officer, Major Roger Vitrat.<ref name=\"Boris Ciglic Autumn 2013\"/> In the beginning of 1918 the new reorganisation was started when the 1st Serbian Escadrille was formed on 17 January, and the 2nd Serbian Escadrille on 1 May 1918, staffed with Serbian personnel.\n\n===World War II===\n{{see also|Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force}}\n[[File:Australian War Memorial Collection MED0321.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force|Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] seaplanes operating in the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert, February 1942.]]]]\nThe attacking forces engaged in the [[April War]] (6 to 17 April) were 2373 aircraft strong, including 1212 aircraft from Germany, 647 from Italy and 287 from Hungary, while the Royal Yugoslav Air Force had 494 airplanes, only 269 of a modern type.  Thus the ratio in the beginning of operations was 5:1 in favor of the enemy, and if we count only modern Yugoslav aircraft the ratio climbs to 7:1 in favor of the Axis powers. In spite of huge logistic difficulties and acts of treason (proclamation of the so-called \"[[Independent State of Croatia]]\" on 10 April 1941) the Royal Yugoslav Air Force fulfilled its duties with honor. Yugoslav airmen fought with incomparable courage against an enemy superior both technically and numerically. Especially, the 5th and 6th Fighter Wing pilots showed their bravery. During the war operations (6 to 15 April) a total of 1416 take-offs was made, 993 of which were performed by fighters and 423 by bombers. During this short war 135 flight crew members and 576 ground personnel bravely lost their lives. \nAbout 300 Yugoslav Air Force personnel escaped, first to [[Greece]] then to [[Crete]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyaircorps-376bg.com/yugo_crews.html|title=Members of the Royal Yugoslavian Air Force crews|work=armyaircorps-376bg.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113142700/http://www.armyaircorps-376bg.com/yugo_crews.html|archive-date=13 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> After the [[Battle of Crete]] they went on to the deserts of the [[Near East|Near]] and Middle East, where for a short time they found a safe place.

At the reception ceremony, on 19 April 1909, Kosta Mileti\u0107 flew a spherical balloon called Srbija (''Serbia''). One balloon was provided from Russia. A gas chamber was ordered from the Dillmann company in Berlin, and a field winch from St Petersburg. A hydrogen unit was provided from the Swiss company Oerlikon. The equipment was delivered to Serbia in 1909 and 1910.\n\nThe first competition for cadet airmen in Serbia was opened in May 1911, and in the following year the first class of Serbian pilots started their flying training in France from 21 May to 8 September 1912 and got the rank of pilot. They finished the course in the beginning of the [[First Balkan War]] with aircraft and the [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] that had already been obtained prior to the outbreak of war.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA66|title=Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia: A-L|first=Walter J.|last=Boyne|date=1 January 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576073452|accessdate=18 January 2017|via=Google Books|p=66}}</ref> In the autumn of 1912, Serbia got the aircraft for its armed forces. On 24 December 1912 the head of the military ministry [[Radomir Putnik]] approved the formation of the Aviation Command situated in Ni\u0161; the commander was Major Kosta Mileti\u0107. It comprised: the Aircraft Squadron which counted 12 military aircraft, the Balloon Company, the [[pigeon post]] and the [[Airbase|Base]]. This date is regarded in Serbia as marking the official founding of the air force. This made [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] one of the first 15 states in the world to have an air force.\n\n===Balkan Wars===\n{{see also|Macedonian Struggle}}\n\nThe First Balkan War broke out in October 1912; Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia waged it against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In this war, the Serbian Aviation Command had its first combat experience. In February 1913, the High Command of Serbian Army formed an expeditionary Coastal Airplane Squadron in order to aid the Montenegrin ground force against Ottoman troops who were reinforced at the town of [[Skadar]] near the [[Adriatic]] coast. Air support for this formation was assigned to the newly established \"Coastal Airplane Squad\", the first Serbian air combat unit, with 4 airplanes ([[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] one-seater, Bl\u00e9riot XI two-seater, [[Deperdussin TT]] and [[Farman HF.20]]) and 5 pilots under the command of Major Kosta Mileti\u0107. In mid-March 1913, this combat air unit was relocated near the frontline at a newly built auxiliary airfield in the village of Barbalusi. The first [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance flight]] was made on 20 March (7 March, [[Old Style and New Style dates|oldstyle]]), by Lt. Zivojin Stankovi\u0107 and Sgt. Mihailo Petrovi\u0107. In this combat-reconnaissance flight on his Farman HF. 20 over the Skadar Front on 20 March 1913, Sgt. Mihailo Petrovi\u0107 was killed, thus becoming the first casualty in the history of the Serbian military aviation and the second one in world aviation history. Mihajlo Petrovi\u0107 was the first trained Serbian airplane pilot. He completed his training and exams at the famous Farman pilot school in France and was awarded the international FAI license no. 979 in June 1912. His Serbian pilot's license carries the number 1.<ref name=\"Miletic\"/> The next day, pilots Lt. Zivojin Stankovich and Sgt. [[Miodrag Tomi\u0107|Miodrag Tomich]] successfully completed their first reconnaissance flights, and in the following days, pilots Milos Ilic, Stankovich and Tomich dropped a number of small bombs and conducted reconnaissance flights. A fascinating fact represents that the pilot Tomich and [[Essad Pasha Toptani|Esad Pasha]], the former Turkish commander at the Skadar frontline, would meet in a completely different situation two years later, during the First World War, when pilot Tomich needed help.\n\nAfter Bulgaria attacked at Bregalnica in Serbia, the [[Second Balkan War]] began. The first reconnaissance mission had been performed by Miodrag Tomi\u0107, and after that Tomi\u0107 and Stankovi\u0107 took turns and during a period of a month and a half, as the war with Bulgarians lasted, the two airmen performed 21 reconnaissance missions, of which Tomi\u0107 did 14 flights. During one flight above [[Kriva Palanka]], Tomi\u0107 encountered a Bulgarian plane in the air, but neither one had weapons and they just greeted one another by hand waving.\n\n===World War I===\n{{see also|July crisis}}\n[[File:FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two men seated in a biplane, surrounded by technical personnel|2nd Lt.

The Aeroplane Escadre had only 9 aeroplanes of which 7 were in flying condition. Five planes and three pilots were relocated to the auxiliary airfield at Dabi\u0107a. From that airfield, Captain's \u017divojin Stankovi\u0107 and 2nd Lieutenant Miodrag Tomi\u0107 on 13 August 1914 commenced their first reconnaissance flights in the [[First World War|Great War]]. Tomi\u0107 took off from the airfield at Jevremovac on 27 August, at five o'clock in the afternoon. Above Mishar he encountered an enemy plane and they were quite close to each other. The enemy plane opened fire on Tomi\u0107, who did not expect this, but he avoided it with an appropriate and fast maneuver, so the plane did not sustain any hits. Fire was coming from a Parabellum. It was \u2013 probably \u2013 the first exchange of fire between aircraft in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PxGkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298&lpg=PA298&dq=miodrag%20tomi%C4%87%20serbian%20%20pilot#v=onepage|title=Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914|first=Prit|last=Buttar|date=20 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|isbn=9781782006480|accessdate=18 January 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Because of [[air superiority]] of the [[Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops|''K.u.K. Luftfahrtruppen'']] over the Serbian Front, in March 1915 the French Escadrille arrived (Escadrille MF 99 S) under command of Captain [[Roger Vitrat]] (1885 [[Libourne]] \u2013 1945 [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]]) to aid the weakness of the Serbian Aeroplane Escadre. The French Escadrille held the frontline from Smederevo to Loznica, and the Serbian Escadre from Smederevo to Golubac. After the conquest of Serbia by the [[Central Powers]] in the autumn of 1915 and the great retreat of the Serbian army to the Greek island of [[Corfu]], the [[Salonica Front]] was formed. During the invasion on Serbia in October 1915, [[Manfred von Richthofen]] was commenced its first combat flight as a pilot. Also, in the autumn of 1915, the first [[medevac|medical transport]] of the wounded and sick in world aviation history was realized in Serbia. One of the ill soldiers in that first medical transport was [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik|Milan Stefanik]], a Czechoslovakian pilot-volunteer.<ref>''L'homme-vent'', special issue of ''L'Ami de P\u00e9zenas'', 2010</ref> In June 1916 the reconstituted Serbian army sailed from Corfu and joined the French and British at [[Salonika]]. At the Salonica Front line, with the support of the Allied force, the Serbian Aeroplane Escadre was reorganized. From mid-1916 to 1918 at the Serbian part of the new established frontline, 5 Escadrilles (N521, N522, N523, N524 and N525) were operated, and squadrons were staffed with most of French and Serbian personnel. These air force units were officially known as the ''A\u00e9ronautique de l'Arm\u00e9e Serbe'' or Serbian Army Air Service and were attached to the High Command of Serbian Army which was a part of Allied Macedonian Army or ''Arm\u00e9e de l'Orient''.<ref name=\"Boris Ciglic Autumn 2013\">{{cite book|title=Premier Serbian Fighters|date=Autumn 2013|publisher=[[Cross and Cockade|Cross and Cockade International Vol 44/3]]|isbn=|url=|author=Boris Ciglic}}</ref> It was commanded by a French officer, Major Roger Vitrat.<ref name=\"Boris Ciglic Autumn 2013\"/> In the beginning of 1918 the new reorganisation was started when the 1st Serbian Escadrille was formed on 17 January, and the 2nd Serbian Escadrille on 1 May 1918, staffed with Serbian personnel.\n\n===World War II===\n{{see also|Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force}}\n[[File:Australian War Memorial Collection MED0321.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force|Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] seaplanes operating in the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert, February 1942.]]]]\nThe attacking forces engaged in the [[April War]] (6 to 17 April) were 2373 aircraft strong, including 1212 aircraft from Germany, 647 from Italy and 287 from Hungary, while the Royal Yugoslav Air Force had 494 airplanes, only 269 of a modern type.  Thus the ratio in the beginning of operations was 5:1 in favor of the enemy, and if we count only modern Yugoslav aircraft the ratio climbs to 7:1 in favor of the Axis powers. In spite of huge logistic difficulties and acts of treason (proclamation of the so-called \"[[Independent State of Croatia]]\" on 10 April 1941) the Royal Yugoslav Air Force fulfilled its duties with honor. Yugoslav airmen fought with incomparable courage against an enemy superior both technically and numerically. Especially, the 5th and 6th Fighter Wing pilots showed their bravery. During the war operations (6 to 15 April) a total of 1416 take-offs was made, 993 of which were performed by fighters and 423 by bombers. During this short war 135 flight crew members and 576 ground personnel bravely lost their lives. \nAbout 300 Yugoslav Air Force personnel escaped, first to [[Greece]] then to [[Crete]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyaircorps-376bg.com/yugo_crews.html|title=Members of the Royal Yugoslavian Air Force crews|work=armyaircorps-376bg.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113142700/http://www.armyaircorps-376bg.com/yugo_crews.html|archive-date=13 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> After the [[Battle of Crete]] they went on to the deserts of the [[Near East|Near]] and Middle East, where for a short time they found a safe place.
