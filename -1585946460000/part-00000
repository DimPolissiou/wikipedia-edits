The first of these side effects is '''Insomnia''', which is the inability to fall asleep.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iconhealthclub.ie/avoid-side-effects-of-pre-workout-supplements/|title=Pre Workout Side Effects and How to Avoid|last=Club|first=Icon Health|date=2017-01-07|website=Icon Health Club|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nA second side effect of consuming pre-workout is '''Diarrhea'''.<ref name=\":8\" /> This is because some ingredients found in pre-workout supplements, including bicarbonate, magnesium, taurine, arginine, yohimbe, creatine and caffeine can act as laxatives for those with sensitive stomachs. Adding water to a supplement can reduce the risk of diarrhea.<ref name=\":8\" /> Additionally, pre-workout supplements that contain between 91-227 mg of sodium bicarbonate per pound may also cause digestive issues.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pre-workout-side-effects|title=5 Side Effects of Pre-Workout Supplements|website=Healthline|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nA third possible side effect of pre-workout is water deficiency, otherwise known as '''dehydration'''.<ref name=\":8\" /> Some ingredients often found in pre-workout supplements can force water out of the body through excretion. Some ingredients do this intentionally to act as diuretics, however, others can cause dehydration, which leads to headaches.<ref name=\":8\" /> In addition to causing dehydration, some ingredients in pre-workout supplements can cause '''vasodilation''', which refers to the expanding of the body's blood vessels. When the blood vessels located in the head of the body expand, '''headaches''' often occur.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAnother possible side effect of taking pre-workout is '''high blood pressure'''. As pre-workout is a stimulus, it will increase blood pressure. This can be an issue for those who have high blood pressure naturally.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nThose who have taken a pre-workout supplement may also feel tingling sensations. This sensation is called '''[[paresthesia]]'''. Although this may be an uncomfortable feeling, the condition poses no threat to the body's central nervous system.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pre-workout-side-effects|title=5 Side Effects of Pre-Workout Supplements|website=Healthline|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Pre-workout supplements that include niacin, beta-aniline, or vitamin B3 are likely to cause tingling or prickly sensations. This is due to the reaction that these ingredients have with the body's central nervous system.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Food and Drug Administration ==\nThe FDA has minimal control when regulating dietary supplements like pre-workout. Product manufacturers are responsible to verify that dietary supplements are safe for consumption.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://injury.findlaw.com/product-liability/ephedra.html|title=Ephedra|website=Findlaw|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Financial limitations prevent the FDA from testing dietary supplements before they enter the marketplace.<ref name=\":52\">{{Cite web|url=https://injury.findlaw.com/product-liability/ephedra.html|title=Ephedra|website=Findlaw|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Once a supplement is available for sale, the FDA is responsible to document and monitor manufacturer reports of adverse effects.<ref name=\":6\" /> Manufacturers are obligated to report documented adverse effects to the FDA.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe FDA recommends speaking with a healthcare professional before using dietary supplements. Ingredients in pre-workout can have negative side effects or contraindications with other medications.<ref name=\":6\" /> Taking dietary supplements may have life-threatening consequences if taken with pre-existing health conditions.<ref name=\":6\" /> Federal laws state that a supplement does not have to be declared safe by FDA standards when labeled.<ref name=\":6\" /> Most supplement businesses hire third-party companies to identify the contents of their supplement to ensure it enhances athletic performance.

Adding water to a supplement can reduce the risk of diarrhea.<ref name=\":82\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iconhealthclub.ie/avoid-side-effects-of-pre-workout-supplements/|title=Pre Workout Side Effects and How to Avoid|last=Club|first=Icon Health|date=2017-01-07|website=Icon Health Club|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Additionally, pre-workout supplements that contain between 91-227 mg of sodium bicarbonate per pound may also cause digestive issues.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pre-workout-side-effects|title=5 Side Effects of Pre-Workout Supplements|website=Healthline|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nA third possible side effect of pre-workout is water deficiency, otherwise known as '''dehydration'''.<ref name=\":8\" /> Some ingredients often found in pre-workout supplements can force water out of the body through excretion. Some ingredients do this intentionally to act as diuretics, however, others can cause dehydration, which leads to headaches.<ref name=\":8\" /> In addition to causing dehydration, some ingredients in pre-workout supplements can cause '''vasodilation''', which refers to the expanding of the body's blood vessels. When the blood vessels located in the head of the body expand, '''headaches''' often occur.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAnother possible side effect of taking pre-workout is '''high blood pressure'''. As pre-workout is a stimulus, it will increase blood pressure. This can be an issue for those who have high blood pressure naturally.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nThose who have taken a pre-workout supplement may also feel tingling sensations. This sensation is called '''[[paresthesia]]'''. Although this may be an uncomfortable feeling, the condition poses no threat to the body's central nervous system.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pre-workout-side-effects|title=5 Side Effects of Pre-Workout Supplements|website=Healthline|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Pre-workout supplements that include niacin, beta-aniline, or vitamin B3 are likely to cause tingling or prickly sensations.

In the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] alphabets, from which the Arabic alphabet is descended, the glottal stop was expressed by ''[[aleph|alif]]'' ([[File:Phoenician aleph.svg|15px]]), continued by ''Alif'' (&nbsp;[[File:Alif-individua-cropt.svg|2px]]&nbsp;) in the Arabic alphabet. However, Alif was used to express both a glottal stop and also a long vowel {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}. In order to indicate that a glottal stop is used, and not a mere vowel, it was added to Alif [[diacritic]]ally.

The following addresses Arabic specifically.\n\n=== Summary ===\n* '''Initial hamza''' is always placed over (\u0623 for {{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bea-}} or {{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beu-}}) or under (\u0625 for {{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bei-}}) an alif.\n* '''Medial hamza''' will have a seat or be written alone:\n** Surrounding vowels determine the seat of the hamza with preceding long vowels and diphthongs (such as {{transl|ar|ALA|aw}} or {{transl|ar|ALA|ay}}) being ignored.\n** ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i-}}'' (\u0626) over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u-}}'' (\u0624) over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a-}}'' (\u0623) if there are two conflicting vowels that count; on the line (\u0621) if there are none.\n** As a special case, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u0101\u02bea, \u016b\u02bea}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aw\u02bea}}'' require hamza on the line, instead of over an alif as one would expect. (See III.1b below.)\n* '''Final hamza''' will have a seat or be written alone:\n** Alone on the line when preceded by a long vowel or final consonant.\n** Has a seat matching the final short vowel for words ending in a short vowel.\n* ''Two adjacent alifs are never allowed.'' If the rules call for this, replace the combination by a single [[Aleph#Alif maddah: \u0622|alif maddah]].\n\n=== Detailed description ===\n*Logically, hamza is just like any other letter, but it may be written in different ways.  It has no effect on the way other letters are written.  In particular, surrounding long vowels are written just as they always are, regardless of the \"seat\" of the hamza\u2014even if this results in the appearance of two consecutive w\u0101ws or y\u0101\u02bes.\n*Hamza can be written in five ways: on its own (\"on the line\"), under an alif, or over an alif, w\u0101w, or y\u0101\u02be, called the \"seat\" of the hamza. When written over y\u0101\u02be, the dots that would normally be written underneath are omitted.\n*When according to the rules below, a hamza with an alif seat would occur before an alif which represents the vowel ''\u0101'', a single alif is instead written with the maddah symbol over it.\n*The rules for hamza depend on whether it occurs as the initial, middle, or final letter (not sound) in a word. (Thus, final short inflectional vowels do not count, but ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-an}}'' is written as alif + [[nunation]], counts, and the hamza is considered medial.)\n\nI. If the hamza is initial:\n\n*If the following letter is a short vowel, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics|fat\u1e25ah]]}}'' (a) (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062f}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beafr\u0101d}}'') or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e0dammah}}'' (u) (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0623\u064f\u0635\u064f\u0648\u0644}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beu\u1e63\u016bl}}''), the hamza is written over a place-holding alif; ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' (i) (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beisl\u0101m}}'') the hamza is written under a place-holding alif and is called \"hamza on a wall.\"\n*If the letter following the hamza is an alif itself: (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0622\u0643\u064f\u0644}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02be\u0101kul}}'') alif maddah will occur.\n\nII. If the hamza is final:\n\n*If a short vowel precedes, the hamza is written over the letter (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif, w\u0101w,}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'') corresponding to the short vowel.\n*Otherwise, the hamza is written on the line (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shay\u02be&nbsp;}}'' \"thing\").\n\nIII. If the hamza is medial:\n\n*If a long vowel or diphthong precedes, the seat of the hamza is determined mostly by what follows:\n\n:*If ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' follows, the hamza is written over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' or {{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}, accordingly.\n:*Otherwise, the hamza would be written on the line. If a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' precedes, however, that would conflict with the stroke joining the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' to the following letter, so the hamza is written over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}.'' (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u062c\u0650\u0626\u064e\u062a}}</big>)\n*Otherwise, both preceding and following vowels have an effect on the hamza.\n\n:*If there is only one vowel (or two of the same kind), that vowel determines the seat (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif, w\u0101w,}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'').\n:*If there are two conflicting vowels, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' takes precedence over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' so ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi\u02beah}}'' 'hundred' is written <big>{{lang|ar|\u0645\u0650\u0626\u064e\u0629}}</big>, with hamza over the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}.''\n:*''Alif-maddah'' occurs if appropriate.\n\nNot surprisingly, the complexity of the rules causes some disagreement.\n*Barron\u2019s ''201 Arabic Verbs'' follows the rules exactly (but the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b\u02be\u016b}}'' does not occur; see below).\n*John Mace\u2019s ''Teach Yourself Arabic Verbs and Essential Grammar'' presents alternative forms in almost all cases when hamza is followed by a long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b}}''. The motivation appears to be to avoid two ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''s in a row. Generally, the choice is between the form following the rules here or an alternative form using hamza over y\u0101\u02be in all cases. Example forms are ''mas\u02be\u016bl'' (<big>\u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0626\u064f\u0648\u0644</big>, [adj: responsible, in charge, accountable]; [noun: official, functionary]), ''yaj\u012b\u02be\u016bna'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''j\u0101\u02bea'' <big>\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e</big> \"to come\"), ''yash\u0101\u02be\u016bna'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''sh\u0101\u02bea'' <big>\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e</big> \"to will, to want, to intend, to wish\").  Exceptions:\n\n:*In the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b\u02be\u016b}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|yas\u016b\u02be\u016bna}}'', <big>\u064a\u064f\u0633\u064e\u0648\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''saww\u0101'' \u0633\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0649 \"to equalize, smoooth, straighten\") the alternatives are hamza on the line, or hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}},'' when the rules here would call for hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''. Perhaps, the resulting sequence of three w\u0101ws would be especially repugnant.\n:*In the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra\u02be\u016bna}}'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''qara\u02bea'' <big>\u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e</big> \"to read, to recite, to review/ study\") the alternative form has hamza over alif, not ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}.''\n:*The forms ''yab\u1e6du\u02be\u016bna'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0637\u064f\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''ba\u1e6du\u02bea'' <big>\u0628\u064e\u0637\u064f\u0624\u064e</big> \"to be or become slow, late or backward, \"to come late\", \"to move slowly\") and ''ya\u02be\u016bbu'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064f</big>, verb: <big>\u0622\u0628\u064e</big> \"move to the back\", \"to return  to come back\", \"to repent\") have no alternative form. (Note ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra\u02be\u016bna}}'' with the same sequence of vowels.)\n*Haywood and Nahmad\u2019s ''A new Arabic Grammar of the Written Language'' does not write the paradigms out in full, but in general agrees with John Mace\u2019s book, including the alternative forms and sometimes lists a third alternative with the entire sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02be\u016b}}'' written as a single hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'' instead of as two letters.\n* ''Al-Kit\u0101b f\u012b Ta\u02bfallum...'' presents paradigms with hamza written the same way throughout, regardless of the rules above. Thus ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yabda\u02be\u016bna}}'' with hamza only over alif, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaj\u012b\u02be\u016bna}}'' with hamza only over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}},'' ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra\u02be\u012bna}}'' with hamza only over alif, but that is not allowed in any of the previous three books. (It appears to be an overgeneralization on the part of the ''al-Kit\u0101b'' writers.)\n\n===Overview tables===\n\nThe letter {{rtl-lang|ar| \u0637 }} (''\u1e6d'') stands here for any

''w\u0101w''s, however, in Modern Arabic this rule is less applicable, thus modern <big>{{lang|ar|\u0631\u064f\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0633}}</big> ''ru\u02be\u016bs'' \"heads\" corresponds to <big>{{lang|ar|\u0631\u064f\u0621\u064f\u0648\u0633}}</big> in the Quran.\n\n== Hamza in other Arabic-based scripts ==\n\n=== Urdu/Shahmukhi script ===\nIn [[Urdu]] script, hamza does not occur at the initial position over alif since alif is not used as a glottal stop in Urdu. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by vowels, it indicates a [[diphthong]] between the two vowels. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by only one vowel, it takes the sound of that vowel. In the final position hamza is silent or produces a glottal sound, as in Arabic.\n\nIn Urdu, hamza usually represents a diphthong between two vowels. It rarely acts like the Arabic hamza except in a few loanwords from Arabic.\n\nHamza is also added at the last letter of the first word of [[ez\u0101fe]] compound to represent -e- if the first word ends with [[Yodh|yeh]] or with [[He (letter)|he]] or over [[Yodh|bari yeh]] if it is added at the end of the first word of the ez\u0101fe compound.\n\nHamza is always written on the line in the middle position unless in [[Waw (letter)|waw]] if that letter is preceded by a non-joiner letter; then, it is seated above waw. Hamza is also seated when written above bari yeh. In the final form, Hamza is written in its full form. In ez\u0101fe, hamza is seated above he, yeh or bari yeh of the first word to represent the -e- of ez\u0101fe compound.\n\n=== Uyghur script ===\nIn the [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]] the hamza is not a distinct letter and is not generally used to denote the glottal stop, but rather to indicate vowels. The hamza is only depicted with vowels in their initial or isolated forms, and only then when the vowel starts a word. It is also occasionally used when a word has two vowels in a row.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nazarova |first1=Gulnisa |last2=Niyaz |first2=Kurban |title=Uyghur: An Elementary Textbook |date=December 2013 |publisher=Georgetown University Press |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=9781589016842 |pages=5\u20138 |edition=Bilingual}}</ref>\n\n== Latin representations ==\nThere are different ways to represent hamza in Latin transliteration:\n\n* In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the sound of the [[glottal stop]] is represented by the letter [[Glottal stop (letter)|\u0294]], resembling a dotless question mark.\n* There is a tradition of using <big>'</big>, the simple apostrophe; and a [[`|grave accent]] \u2039<big>`</big>\u203a represents `ayn ({{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}}).\n* Some [[Arabic transliteration|standard transliterations]], such as [[DIN 31635]], transliterate it with a [[modifier letter right half ring]] <span title=\"Modifier letter right half ring\" style=\"font-size: 170%;\">\u02be</span> and others such as [[ALA-LC]] with the [[modifier letter apostrophe]] <span title=\"Modifier letter apostrophe\" style=\"font-size: 160%;\">\u02bc</span> and sometimes substituted with the Right Single Quotation Mark <span title=\"Modifier letter apostrophe\" style=\"font-size: 160%;\">\u2019</span>.\n* Different unstandardized symbols exist such as ''[[2 (number)|2]]'' in [[Arabic chat alphabet]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[\u02bc]] and [[\u02be]]\n* [[Aleph]]\n* [[Arabic alphabet]]\n* [[Glottal stop (letter)]]\n* [[Harakat]]\n* [[Romanization of Arabic]]\n* [[Arabic phonology]]\n* [[Varieties of Arabic]]\n* [[Help:IPA/Arabic]]\n* [[\u02bbOkina]]\n*[[Hamza (name)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.salaamarabic.com/lesson/plan/1494/glottal_stop Interactive lesson for learning hamza]\n\n{{commons category}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Arabic diacritics]]\n[[Category:Spelling]]\n[[Category:Graphemes]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the letter|other uses|Hamza (disambiguation)|the name transcribed by the same spelling|Hamza (name)}}\n{{distinguish|text={{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|\u2018ayn}}), which has a similar looking initial form}}\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox grapheme\n|name=Hamza<br>{{lang|ar|\u0647\u0645\u0632\u0629}}\n|letter=\u0621\n|variations=\n|image=File:Hamzah-individua-cropt.svg\n|imagesize=200\n|imagealt=\n|script=[[Arabic script]]\n|type=[[Abjad]]\n|typedesc=\n|language=[[Arabic language]]\n|phonemes={{IPAslink|\u0294}}\n|unicode=\n|alphanumber=\n|number=\n|usageperiod=\n|children=\n|equivalents=\n|associates=\n|direction=Right-to-left\n}}\n{{Arabic alphabet}}\n'''Hamza''' ({{lang-ar|\u0647\u0645\u0632\u0629}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'') ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:\u0621|\u0621]]}}) is a letter in the [[Arabic alphabet]], representing the [[glottal stop]] {{IPAblink|\u0294}}. Hamza is not one of the 28 \"full\" letters and owes its existence to historical inconsistencies in the [[orthography|standard writing system]]. It is derived from the Arabic letter ''[[Ayin|\u02bfAyn]]'' ({{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}}). In the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] alphabets, from which the Arabic alphabet is descended, the glottal stop was expressed by ''[[aleph|alif]]'' ([[File:Phoenician aleph.svg|15px]]), continued by ''Alif'' (&nbsp;[[File:Alif-individua-cropt.svg|2px]]&nbsp;) in the Arabic alphabet. However, Alif was used to express both a glottal stop and also a long vowel {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}}. In order to indicate that a glottal stop is used, and not a mere vowel, it was added to Alif [[diacritic]]ally. In modern orthography,  hamza may also appear on the line, under certain circumstances as though it were a full letter, independent of an Alif.

The following addresses Arabic specifically.\n\n=== Summary ===\n* '''Initial hamza''' is always placed over (\u0623 for {{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bea-}} or {{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beu-}}) or under (\u0625 for {{transl|ar|ALA|\u02bei-}}) an alif.\n* '''Medial hamza''' will have a seat or be written alone:\n** Surrounding vowels determine the seat of the hamza with preceding long vowels and diphthongs (such as {{transl|ar|ALA|aw}} or {{transl|ar|ALA|ay}}) being ignored.\n** ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i-}}'' (\u0626) over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u-}}'' (\u0624) over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a-}}'' (\u0623) if there are two conflicting vowels that count; on the line (\u0621) if there are none.\n** As a special case, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u0101\u02bea, \u016b\u02bea}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aw\u02bea}}'' require hamza on the line, instead of over an alif as one would expect. (See III.1b below.)\n* '''Final hamza''' will have a seat or be written alone:\n** Alone on the line when preceded by a long vowel or final consonant.\n** Has a seat matching the final short vowel for words ending in a short vowel.\n* ''Two adjacent alifs are never allowed.'' If the rules call for this, replace the combination by a single [[Aleph#Alif maddah: \u0622|alif maddah]].\n\n=== Detailed description ===\n*Logically, hamza is just like any other letter, but it may be written in different ways.  It has no effect on the way other letters are written.  In particular, surrounding long vowels are written just as they always are, regardless of the \"seat\" of the hamza\u2014even if this results in the appearance of two consecutive w\u0101ws or y\u0101\u02bes.\n*Hamza can be written in five ways: on its own (\"on the line\"), under an alif, or over an alif, w\u0101w, or y\u0101\u02be, called the \"seat\" of the hamza. When written over y\u0101\u02be, the dots that would normally be written underneath are omitted.\n*When according to the rules below, a hamza with an alif seat would occur before an alif which represents the vowel ''\u0101'', a single alif is instead written with the maddah symbol over it.\n*The rules for hamza depend on whether it occurs as the initial, middle, or final letter (not sound) in a word. (Thus, final short inflectional vowels do not count, but ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-an}}'' is written as alif + [[nunation]], counts, and the hamza is considered medial.)\n\nI. If the hamza is initial:\n\n*If the following letter is a short vowel, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics|fat\u1e25ah]]}}'' (a) (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062f}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beafr\u0101d}}'') or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e0dammah}}'' (u) (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0623\u064f\u0635\u064f\u0648\u0644}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beu\u1e63\u016bl}}''), the hamza is written over a place-holding alif; ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' (i) (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02beisl\u0101m}}'') the hamza is written under a place-holding alif and is called \"hamza on a wall.\"\n*If the letter following the hamza is an alif itself: (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0622\u0643\u064f\u0644}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02be\u0101kul}}'') alif maddah will occur.\n\nII. If the hamza is final:\n\n*If a short vowel precedes, the hamza is written over the letter (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif, w\u0101w,}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'') corresponding to the short vowel.\n*Otherwise, the hamza is written on the line (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0621}}</big> ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shay\u02be&nbsp;}}'' \"thing\").\n\nIII. If the hamza is medial:\n\n*If a long vowel or diphthong precedes, the seat of the hamza is determined mostly by what follows:\n\n:*If ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' follows, the hamza is written over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' or {{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}, accordingly.\n:*Otherwise, the hamza would be written on the line. If a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' precedes, however, that would conflict with the stroke joining the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'' to the following letter, so the hamza is written over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}.'' (as in <big>{{lang|ar|\u062c\u0650\u0626\u064e\u062a}}</big>)\n*Otherwise, both preceding and following vowels have an effect on the hamza.\n\n:*If there is only one vowel (or two of the same kind), that vowel determines the seat (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif, w\u0101w,}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}'').\n:*If there are two conflicting vowels, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' takes precedence over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' so ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi\u02beah}}'' 'hundred' is written <big>{{lang|ar|\u0645\u0650\u0626\u064e\u0629}}</big>, with hamza over the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}.''\n:*''Alif-maddah'' occurs if appropriate.\n\nNot surprisingly, the complexity of the rules causes some disagreement.\n*Barron\u2019s ''201 Arabic Verbs'' follows the rules exactly (but the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b\u02be\u016b}}'' does not occur; see below).\n*John Mace\u2019s ''Teach Yourself Arabic Verbs and Essential Grammar'' presents alternative forms in almost all cases when hamza is followed by a long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b}}''. The motivation appears to be to avoid two ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''s in a row. Generally, the choice is between the form following the rules here or an alternative form using hamza over y\u0101\u02be in all cases. Example forms are ''mas\u02be\u016bl'' (<big>\u0645\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0626\u064f\u0648\u0644</big>, [adj: responsible, in charge, accountable]; [noun: official, functionary]), ''yaj\u012b\u02be\u016bna'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''j\u0101\u02bea'' <big>\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e</big> \"to come\"), ''yash\u0101\u02be\u016bna'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''sh\u0101\u02bea'' <big>\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e</big> \"to will, to want, to intend, to wish\").  Exceptions:\n\n:*In the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u016b\u02be\u016b}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|yas\u016b\u02be\u016bna}}'', <big>\u064a\u064f\u0633\u064e\u0648\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''saww\u0101'' \u0633\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0649 \"to equalize, smoooth, straighten\") the alternatives are hamza on the line, or hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}},'' when the rules here would call for hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}''. Perhaps, the resulting sequence of three w\u0101ws would be especially repugnant.\n:*In the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra\u02be\u016bna}}'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''qara\u02bea'' <big>\u0642\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0623\u064e</big> \"to read, to recite, to review/ study\") the alternative form has hamza over alif, not ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}}.''\n:*The forms ''yab\u1e6du\u02be\u016bna'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0637\u064f\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e</big>, verb: ''ba\u1e6du\u02bea'' <big>\u0628\u064e\u0637\u064f\u0624\u064e</big> \"to be or become slow, late or backward, \"to come late\", \"to move slowly\") and ''ya\u02be\u016bbu'' (<big>\u064a\u064e\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064f</big>, verb: <big>\u0622\u0628\u064e</big> \"move to the back\", \"to return  to come back\", \"to repent\") have no alternative form. (Note ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra\u02be\u016bna}}'' with the same sequence of vowels.)\n*Haywood and Nahmad\u2019s ''A new Arabic Grammar of the Written Language'' does not write the paradigms out in full, but in general agrees with John Mace\u2019s book, including the alternative forms and sometimes lists a third alternative with the entire sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|\u02be\u016b}}'' written as a single hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|w\u0101w}}'' instead of as two letters.\n* ''Al-Kit\u0101b f\u012b Ta\u02bfallum...'' presents paradigms with hamza written the same way throughout, regardless of the rules above. Thus ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yabda\u02be\u016bna}}'' with hamza only over alif, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaj\u012b\u02be\u016bna}}'' with hamza only over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|y\u0101\u02be}},'' ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra\u02be\u012bna}}'' with hamza only over alif, but that is not allowed in any of the previous three books. (It appears to be an overgeneralization on the part of the ''al-Kit\u0101b'' writers.)\n\n===Overview tables===\n\nThe letter {{rtl-lang|ar| \u0637 }} (''\u1e6d'') stands here for any

''w\u0101w''s, however, in Modern Arabic this rule is less applicable, thus modern <big>{{lang|ar|\u0631\u064f\u0624\u064f\u0648\u0633}}</big> ''ru\u02be\u016bs'' \"heads\" corresponds to <big>{{lang|ar|\u0631\u064f\u0621\u064f\u0648\u0633}}</big> in the Quran.\n\n== Hamza in other Arabic-based scripts ==\n\n=== Urdu/Shahmukhi script ===\nIn [[Urdu]] script, hamza does not occur at the initial position over alif since alif is not used as a glottal stop in Urdu. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by vowels, it indicates a [[diphthong]] between the two vowels. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by only one vowel, it takes the sound of that vowel. In the final position hamza is silent or produces a glottal sound, as in Arabic.\n\nIn Urdu, hamza usually represents a diphthong between two vowels. It rarely acts like the Arabic hamza except in a few loanwords from Arabic.\n\nHamza is also added at the last letter of the first word of [[ez\u0101fe]] compound to represent -e- if the first word ends with [[Yodh|yeh]] or with [[He (letter)|he]] or over [[Yodh|bari yeh]] if it is added at the end of the first word of the ez\u0101fe compound.\n\nHamza is always written on the line in the middle position unless in [[Waw (letter)|waw]] if that letter is preceded by a non-joiner letter; then, it is seated above waw. Hamza is also seated when written above bari yeh. In the final form, Hamza is written in its full form. In ez\u0101fe, hamza is seated above he, yeh or bari yeh of the first word to represent the -e- of ez\u0101fe compound.\n\n=== Uyghur script ===\nIn the [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]] the hamza is not a distinct letter and is not generally used to denote the glottal stop, but rather to indicate vowels. The hamza is only depicted with vowels in their initial or isolated forms, and only then when the vowel starts a word. It is also occasionally used when a word has two vowels in a row.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nazarova |first1=Gulnisa |last2=Niyaz |first2=Kurban |title=Uyghur: An Elementary Textbook |date=December 2013 |publisher=Georgetown University Press |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=9781589016842 |pages=5\u20138 |edition=Bilingual}}</ref>\n\n== Latin representations ==\nThere are different ways to represent hamza in Latin transliteration:\n\n* In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the sound of the [[glottal stop]] is represented by the letter [[Glottal stop (letter)|\u0294]], resembling a dotless question mark.\n* There is a tradition of using <big>'</big>, the simple apostrophe; and a [[`|grave accent]] \u2039<big>`</big>\u203a represents `ayn ({{lang|ar|[[\u0639]]}}).\n* Some [[Arabic transliteration|standard transliterations]], such as [[DIN 31635]], transliterate it with a [[modifier letter right half ring]] <span title=\"Modifier letter right half ring\" style=\"font-size: 170%;\">\u02be</span> and others such as [[ALA-LC]] with the [[modifier letter apostrophe]] <span title=\"Modifier letter apostrophe\" style=\"font-size: 160%;\">\u02bc</span> and sometimes substituted with the Right Single Quotation Mark <span title=\"Modifier letter apostrophe\" style=\"font-size: 160%;\">\u2019</span>.\n* Different unstandardized symbols exist such as ''[[2 (number)|2]]'' in [[Arabic chat alphabet]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[\u02bc]] and [[\u02be]]\n* [[Aleph]]\n* [[Arabic alphabet]]\n* [[Glottal stop (letter)]]\n* [[Harakat]]\n* [[Romanization of Arabic]]\n* [[Arabic phonology]]\n* [[Varieties of Arabic]]\n* [[Help:IPA/Arabic]]\n* [[\u02bbOkina]]\n*[[Hamza (name)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.salaamarabic.com/lesson/plan/1494/glottal_stop Interactive lesson for learning hamza]\n\n{{commons category}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Arabic diacritics]]\n[[Category:Spelling]]\n[[Category:Graphemes]]\n", "name_user": "Faizan.amir5555", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza"}

Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]\nThe Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to desintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.

The show was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The show went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe show was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the show were produced while five more were written, but never completed. [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]] for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the show's cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics\u2014including a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\"\u2014have been released through various internet outlets.\n\n===Only-series (1999\u20132002)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#7ea6e2\n|overall=\n|title=25\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = Pilot (or The Douchebag Aspect)\n|DirectedBy = [[Lauren MacMullan]]\n|WrittenBy = [[Bill Oakley]] & [[Josh Weinstein]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|9|24}}\n|ProdCode = 3950-01\n|ShortSummary = Andy French, an aspiring cartoonist working at a waterbed store run by a sleazy, ambiguously Eastern European man named Ron, is forced to take in his annoying little brother, Kevin, after Andy's parents decide to move away to Wyoming and not take Kevin with them.\n''Music'': \"Burning Flies\" by [[Looper (band)|Looper]], \"Couldn't You Wait\" (Acoustic Version) by [[Silkworm (band)|Silkworm]], \"Don't Let the Bastards Grind You Down\" by [[The Toasters]], \"Rude Boy Rock\" by [[Lionrock]]\n| LineColor = 7ea6e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Andy Joins the PTA (or Great Sexpectations)\n|DirectedBy = Gary McCarver\n|WrittenBy = [[Andrew Kreisberg]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|26}} <small>(on [[Adult Swim]])</small>\n|ProdCode = 3950-02\n|ShortSummary = When Andy attends Kevin's parent-teacher conference en lieu of their mother and father, he joins the PTA in order to impress Kevin's English teacher.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the show was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the show's \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe show won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The show was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The show went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe show was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the show were produced while five more were written, but never completed. [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]] for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the show's cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics\u2014including a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\"\u2014have been released through various internet outlets.\n\n===Only-series (1999\u20132002)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#7ea6e2\n|overall=\n|title=25\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = Pilot (or The Douchebag Aspect)\n|DirectedBy = [[Lauren MacMullan]]\n|WrittenBy = [[Bill Oakley]] & [[Josh Weinstein]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|9|24}}\n|ProdCode = 3950-01\n|ShortSummary = Andy French, an aspiring cartoonist working at a waterbed store run by a sleazy, ambiguously Eastern European man named Ron, is forced to take in his annoying little brother, Kevin, after Andy's parents decide to move away to Wyoming and not take Kevin with them.\n''Music'': \"Burning Flies\" by [[Looper (band)|Looper]], \"Couldn't You Wait\" (Acoustic Version) by [[Silkworm (band)|Silkworm]], \"Don't Let the Bastards Grind You Down\" by [[The Toasters]], \"Rude Boy Rock\" by [[Lionrock]]\n| LineColor = 7ea6e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Andy Joins the PTA (or Great Sexpectations)\n|DirectedBy = Gary McCarver\n|WrittenBy = [[Andrew Kreisberg]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|5|26}} <small>(on [[Adult Swim]])</small>\n|ProdCode = 3950-02\n|ShortSummary = When Andy attends Kevin's parent-teacher conference en lieu of their mother and father, he joins the PTA in order to impress Kevin's English teacher.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the show was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to it's fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the show's \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe show won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
