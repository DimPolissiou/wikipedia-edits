Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|seventh season]], which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\n\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the [[Night King]] and his army of [[White Walkers]] and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat [[Cersei Lannister]] as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' and ''[[A Dream of Spring]]''. The season was adapted for television by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\nThe season received mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the near-universal praise of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Although the acting, directing, production, visual effects, and musical score continued to be highly praised, criticism was directed at the story, writing, dialogue, condensed narrative and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners; many deemed it to be a disappointing conclusion to the series. It is now regarded as one of the worst seasons of television ever made.\n\nThe season received 32 nominations at the [[71st Primetime Emmy Awards]], the most for a single season of television in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/awards/emmy-nominations-2019-game-of-thrones-analysis-netflix-hbo-1203268722/ |title=Emmys 2019 Nominations: HBO Back at the Top, as 'Game of Thrones' Makes History |work=Variety |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=July 16, 2019 |accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> It won twelve, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] for [[Peter Dinklage]].\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--Summaries should not be over 200 words per WP:TVPLOT.

Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|seventh season]], which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\n\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the [[Night King]] and his army of [[White Walkers]] and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat [[Cersei Lannister]] as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' and ''[[A Dream of Spring]]''. The season was adapted for television by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\nThe season received mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the near-universal praise of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Although the acting, directing, production, visual effects, and musical score continued to be highly praised, criticism was directed at the story, writing, dialogue, condensed narrative and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners; many deemed it to be a disappointing conclusion to the series.\n\nThe season received 32 nominations at the [[71st Primetime Emmy Awards]], the most for a single season of television in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/awards/emmy-nominations-2019-game-of-thrones-analysis-netflix-hbo-1203268722/ |title=Emmys 2019 Nominations: HBO Back at the Top, as 'Game of Thrones' Makes History |work=Variety |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=July 16, 2019 |accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> It won twelve, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] for [[Peter Dinklage]].\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--Summaries should not be over 200 words per WP:TVPLOT.

Euron returns to King's Landing with the Golden Company and entices Cersei to consummate their union. On Cersei's orders, Qyburn hires Bronn to assassinate Tyrion and Jaime. Theon rescues Yara, who then sets out to retake the Iron Islands, while Theon returns to Winterfell. At Winterfell, Jon reunites with Bran and Arya, and later learns to ride Rhaegal, during which Jon and Daenerys deepen their bond.

At House Umber's seat of Last Hearth, Tormund and Beric encounter Edd and other Night's Watch members. They find the castle's occupants dead, and the wight of Ned Umber is left as a gruesome message.

After Tyrion reveals Varys' plot, Daenerys executes Varys by dragon fire. Jaime is captured, but Tyrion releases him so Jaime can persuade Cersei to surrender the city and then escape Westeros with Cersei. Jaime, Arya, and the Hound each infiltrate King's Landing. Atop Drogon, Daenerys destroys the Iron Fleet and most of the city's defenses, allowing her army to enter. Cersei's forces are quickly overwhelmed and the city signals its surrender, but an enraged Daenerys begins leveling the city, burning soldiers and civilians. The allied army follows her lead, slaughtering anyone in their path, horrifying Tyrion and Jon. Jaime kills Euron but is himself mortally wounded. The Hound convinces Arya to abandon her longtime vendetta and save herself, then confronts the Mountain. The brothers ultimately perish after falling from a tower into flames. Cersei and Jaime reunite but are killed as the Red Keep collapses atop them. Jon calls for a retreat as frantic civilians flee the devastation.

Tyrion finds Jaime and Cersei dead in the ruins. Daenerys rallies the Unsullied and Dothraki, declaring she will lead them to \"liberate\" the entire world. Tyrion denounces her and resigns as Hand. He is imprisoned for treason to await execution. Arya and Tyrion separately warn Jon that Daenerys is a threat to House Stark and the people. Jon confronts Daenerys. Unable to halt her destructive path, an agonized Jon kills her. Drogon melts the Iron Throne, then gently carries Daenerys' body away. Tyrion proposes that all future monarchs be chosen by Westerosi leaders, rather than through familial succession. Bran Stark is proclaimed king, titled ''Bran the Broken''. He grants Sansa the North's secession as an independent kingdom and appoints Tyrion as his Hand. Jon is sentenced to the Night's Watch to appease the Unsullied, who then set sail for Naath, Missandei's homeland. Tyrion reorganizes the Small Council \u2013 Brienne, Bronn, Davos, and Sam \u2013 to rebuild King's Landing. Podrick is knighted. Sansa is crowned Queen in the North. Arya sets sail to explore west of Westeros. Jon rejoins Tormund and Ghost at Castle Black, leading the Wildlings north of the Wall.\n |LineColor       = 3D424A\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- NOTE: We don't need nicknames for every character.

Also, once the series ran out of book material as a source, Hill noted that \"special niche interest in weirdos wasn't as effective as it had been\". However, Hill was \"not dissatisfied on the whole\" regarding the series.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hibberd |first1=James |title=Game of Thrones actor on his surprise death: 'Nothing could console me' |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/12/game-of-thrones-varys-interview/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 12, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLena Headey had a \"mixed\" initial reaction to the manner of death of Cersei Lannister, the character she played. Headey would rather have Cersei die by \"some big piece or fight with somebody\". Eventually, fellow actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau persuaded Headey on how to appreciate the scene, and she said her eventual belief that \"it seemed like the perfect end for\" Cersei because Cersei and Jaime \"came into the world together and now they leave together\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hibberd |first1=James |title=Game of Thrones: Lena Headey reacts to that King's Landing battle ending |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/12/game-thrones-cersei-kings-landing-battle-interview/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 12, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{see also|List of awards and nominations received by Game of Thrones}}\nWith 32 nominations, ''Game of Thrones'' broke the record of the most nominations received by a regular TV show in a single year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!

Their lives soon intertwine once again when Dominador was killed during a mission in stopping a human-trafficking syndicate. Ricardo must now take the identity of his brother and finish the mission he started, while also learning more about his biological family. During his mission, Ricardo faces various obstacles in his path in finding justice. One of his biggest encounters is the Tuazon family, a rich philanthropist family to the public, but a family of drug lords and human-trafficking syndicate leader in their personal lives.\n\n====Season 2 (2016\u20132017)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 2)}}\nThe second season ''Ang Probinsyano'' revolves around Cardo's quest to seek justice for the death of his brother, Ador. In his search for justice, Cardo uncovers the criminal empire of the Tuazons, and in the process finds out about their involvement in the demise of his father, brother and sister-in-law.\n\n===Book 2: Rebellion and Terrorism Arc (2017\u20132018)===\n====Season 3 (2017)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 3)}}\nThe third season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' is about Ricardo Dalisay, in his married life and how he is battling the rebels. As he finished his mission against the drug and human-trafficking syndicates, he continues his next mission in putting a stop to the illegal activities in the countries. He goes undercover and goes into a group called ''Pulang Araw'', a rebel group fighting for rights. During his mission, he encounters several activities that put him on the nation's wanted list once again.\n\n====Season 4 (2017\u20132018)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 4)}}\nThe fourth season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' deals with the looming [[Elections in the Philippines|mid-year elections]] in the Philippines, where [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] Mateo F. De Silva and [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Director]] Renato Hipolito are both jockeying for the top spot at the polls in order to secure the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate Presidency]] and parlay such victory into a career as the [[President of the Philippines]]. Both De Silva and Hipolito relentlessly hunt down Cardo and the remnants of ''Pulang Araw'' in order to appeal to the voters. De Silva funds his campaign with the aid of his new-found ally, Don Emilio Syquia, through their drug-trading business. With the remaining members of ''Pulang Araw'' and his allies in prison, Cardo forms the vigilante group ''Vendetta'' to combat corruption in the [[Philippines]]. However, with the elections drawing nearer, both De Silva and Hipolito continue to malign the name of ''Vendetta'' through Luis \"Buwaya\" Mangubat and Homer \"Alakdan\" Adlawan's ''Kamandag'', respectively, each performing acts of terrorism which are blamed on ''Vendetta''. Elsewhere, Cardo's marriage to Alyana is also put to the test as she is pursued by her new boss, Marco Cabrera.\n\n===Book 3: Political Arc (2018\u20132019)===\n====Season 5 (2018)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 5)}}\nThe fifth season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' chronicles Cardo and ''Vendetta's'' struggle against corruption in the larger Philippine political arena. ''Vendetta'' not only has to fight the Renato Hipolito-backed terrorist group ''Kamandag'', they are also up against a gun-running ring operated by the [[Vice President of the Philippines]], Lucas Cabrera.\n\nHipolito and Cabrera, beyond being from the same political party have joined forces to combat ''Vendetta'' and to secure for Hipolito the top spot in the mid-year senatorial elections. Hipolito intends to use the top senatorial spot to catapult him to the presidency in the next presidential elections. Cabrera, on the other hand, wants the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to be dominated by his partymates, with Hipolito leading the charge as [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], in order to ensure that Cabrera will win the presidency in the next national elections unaware of Hipolito's intent to double-cross him to secure the presidency for himself.\n\n====Season 6 (2018\u20132019)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 6)}}\n\nThe sixth season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' follows Cardo and ''Vendetta's'' continued struggle against Lucas Cabrera, now [[President of the Philippines]] and Renato Hipolito. After rescuing the incumbent President Oscar Hidalgo from an assassination plot intended to supplant him as president, Vendetta must now find a way to restore Hidalgo back to the Presidency.\n\nElsewhere, Vendetta will also have to deal with Don Emilio Syquia who has reemerged from hiding. Now going by the name ''Se\u00f1or'' Gustavo Torralba, his newfound criminal empire enjoys the protection of the Cabrera administration through the auspices of Hipolito.\n\nAs Vendetta makes its way back to Manila, their path will cross with the [[bagman|baglady]] of the Cabrera administration, Lily Ann Cortez ([[Lorna Tolentino]]). Lily plans on making the conflict between Vendetta and the Cabrera Administration more direct and emerge with the spoils from whoever it is left standing. Lily secretly pits the Vendetta and the president against each other, resulting to the death of Cabrera and Hipolito getting seriously wounded. Hipolito, with the help of Lily goes into hiding and vows to exact revenge against Vendetta. Vendetta emerges victorious and surrendered to the authorities soon after with the help of the real, now reinstated President Oscar Hidalgo.\n\n===Book 4: Crime and Corruption Arc (2019\u2013present)===\n====Season 7 (2019\u2013present)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 7)}}\n\nThe seventh season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' sees the culmination of Vendetta's arduous struggle against the corrupt Cabrera administration.\n\nThe whole country celebrates the victory of Vendetta and the reinstating of Hidalgo back to his rightful post. After narrating his experience with the Vendetta and their true intent for the welfare of the country to the mass media and the public, Hidalgo wastes no time prosecuting Cabrera's remaining allies and making good on his promise to improve the condition of the country, seeing first hand what the people below experience. Thereafter, Hidalgo grants [[presidential pardon]] to the members of Vendetta and creates a special task force to be led by Cardo in order to combat criminality in the country.\n\nBut with Vendetta emerging victorious in its drawn out battle with Cabrera, Lily has amassed sufficient clout with the now restored Hidalgo and the members of Vendetta and intends to cash in on this debt of gratitude by keeping a close connection with the latter to mask her criminal activities.\n\nHipolito, on the other hand, having survived the skirmish that killed Cabrera also through help of Lily, intends on getting revenge and subjecting the Philippines to widespread fear under his heel. Lily will again try to pit Hipolito and the Hidalgo administration against each other with the aim of veiling her own illicit designs.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Ang Probinsyano characters}} <!---The current main cast list should be ordered on how they are credited in the opening credits.

Their lives soon intertwine once again when Dominador was killed during a mission in stopping a human-trafficking syndicate. Ricardo must now take the identity of his brother and finish the mission he started, while also learning more about his biological family. During his mission, Ricardo faces various obstacles in his path in finding justice. One of his biggest encounters is the Tuazon family, a rich philanthropist family to the public, but a family of drug lords and human-trafficking syndicate leader in their personal lives.\n\n====Season 2 (2016\u20132017)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 2)}}\nThe second season ''Ang Probinsyano'' revolves around Cardo's quest to seek justice for the death of his brother, Ador. In his search for justice, Cardo uncovers the criminal empire of the Tuazons, and in the process finds out about their involvement in the demise of his father, brother and sister-in-law.\n\n===Book 2: Rebellion and Terrorism Arc (2017\u20132018)===\n====Season 3 (2017)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 3)}}\nThe third season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' is about Ricardo Dalisay, in his married life and how he is battling the rebels. As he finished his mission against the drug and human-trafficking syndicates, he continues his next mission in putting a stop to the illegal activities in the countries. He goes undercover and goes into a group called ''Pulang Araw'', a rebel group fighting for rights. During his mission, he encounters several activities that put him on the nation's wanted list once again.\n\n====Season 4 (2017\u20132018)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 4)}}\nThe fourth season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' deals with the looming [[Elections in the Philippines|mid-year elections]] in the Philippines, where [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] Mateo F. De Silva and [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Director]] Renato Hipolito are both jockeying for the top spot at the polls in order to secure the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate Presidency]] and parlay such victory into a career as the [[President of the Philippines]]. Both De Silva and Hipolito relentlessly hunt down Cardo and the remnants of ''Pulang Araw'' in order to appeal to the voters. De Silva funds his campaign with the aid of his new-found ally, Don Emilio Syquia, through their drug-trading business. With the remaining members of ''Pulang Araw'' and his allies in prison, Cardo forms the vigilante group ''Vendetta'' to combat corruption in the [[Philippines]]. However, with the elections drawing nearer, both De Silva and Hipolito continue to malign the name of ''Vendetta'' through Luis \"Buwaya\" Mangubat and Homer \"Alakdan\" Adlawan's ''Kamandag'', respectively, each performing acts of terrorism which are blamed on ''Vendetta''. Elsewhere, Cardo's marriage to Alyana is also put to the test as she is pursued by her new boss, Marco Cabrera.\n\n===Book 3: Political Arc (2018\u20132019)===\n====Season 5 (2018)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 5)}}\nThe fifth season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' chronicles Cardo and ''Vendetta's'' struggle against corruption in the larger Philippine political arena. ''Vendetta'' not only has to fight the Renato Hipolito-backed terrorist group ''Kamandag'', they are also up against a gun-running ring operated by the [[Vice President of the Philippines]], Lucas Cabrera.\n\nHipolito and Cabrera, beyond being from the same political party have joined forces to combat ''Vendetta'' and to secure for Hipolito the top spot in the mid-year senatorial elections. Hipolito intends to use the top senatorial spot to catapult him to the presidency in the next presidential elections. Cabrera, on the other hand, wants the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to be dominated by his partymates, with Hipolito leading the charge as [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], in order to ensure that Cabrera will win the presidency in the next national elections unaware of Hipolito's intent to double-cross him to secure the presidency for himself.\n\n====Season 6 (2018\u20132019)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 6)}}\n\nThe sixth season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' follows Cardo and ''Vendetta's'' continued struggle against Lucas Cabrera, now [[President of the Philippines]] and Renato Hipolito. After rescuing the incumbent President Oscar Hidalgo from an assassination plot intended to supplant him as president, Vendetta must now find a way to restore Hidalgo back to the Presidency.\n\nElsewhere, Vendetta will also have to deal with Don Emilio Syquia who has reemerged from hiding. Now going by the name ''Se\u00f1or'' Gustavo Torralba, his newfound criminal empire enjoys the protection of the Cabrera administration through the auspices of Hipolito.\n\nAs Vendetta makes its way back to Manila, their path will cross with the [[bagman|baglady]] of the Cabrera administration, Lily Ann Cortez ([[Lorna Tolentino]]). Lily plans on making the conflict between Vendetta and the Cabrera Administration more direct and emerge with the spoils from whoever it is left standing. Lily secretly pits the Vendetta and the president against each other, resulting to the death of Cabrera and Hipolito getting seriously wounded. Hipolito, with the help of Lily goes into hiding and vows to exact revenge against Vendetta. Vendetta emerges victorious and surrendered to the authorities soon after with the help of the real, now reinstated President Oscar Hidalgo.\n\n===Book 4: Crime and Corruption Arc (2019\u2013present)===\n====Season 7 (2019\u2013present)====\n{{main|Ang Probinsyano (season 7)}}\n\nThe seventh season of ''Ang Probinsyano'' sees the culmination of Vendetta's arduous struggle against the corrupt Cabrera administration.\n\nThe whole country celebrates the victory of Vendetta and the reinstating of Hidalgo back to his rightful post. After narrating his experience with the Vendetta and their true intent for the welfare of the country to the mass media and the public, Hidalgo wastes no time prosecuting Cabrera's remaining allies and making good on his promise to improve the condition of the country, seeing first hand what the people below experience. Thereafter, Hidalgo grants [[presidential pardon]] to the members of Vendetta and creates a special task force to be led by Cardo in order to combat criminality in the country.\n\nBut with Vendetta emerging victorious in its drawn out battle with Cabrera, Lily has amassed sufficient clout with the now restored Hidalgo and the members of Vendetta and intends to cash in on this debt of gratitude by keeping a close connection with the latter to mask her criminal activities.\n\nHipolito, on the other hand, having survived the skirmish that killed Cabrera also through help of Lily, intends on getting revenge and subjecting the Philippines to widespread fear under his heel. Lily will again try to pit Hipolito and the Hidalgo administration against each other with the aim of veiling her own illicit designs.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Ang Probinsyano characters}} <!---The current main cast list should be ordered on how they are credited in the opening credits.

MTRCB Chairman Eugenio Villareal noted that the summoned personnel manifested that they had no intention to offend anyone in regard to the subject scene; and they believe that there is room for improvement for the program as regards sensitivity to particular types of audience, for instance, the young and women.<ref name=\"RainGirl\"/>\n\nVillareal likewise said that they took note of the show's \"self-regulatory resolution\" to fight objectification and depict scenes instead where the \"dignity of the human person is upheld.\"<ref name=\"RainGirl\"/>\n\n====Mt.

The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.\n\nWinchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\n\nThe earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308.

In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral.

The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts.

It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]].<ref name=\"RTGB\">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.\n\nWinchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\n\nThe earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.\n\nEntrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967.

It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.\n\n===Castle===\n{{Main|Winchester Castle}}\n[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]\nWinchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence training\">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Hospital of St Cross===\n{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}\n[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]\nThe [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s.
