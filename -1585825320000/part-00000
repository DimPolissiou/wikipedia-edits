A very kind hearted, good natured fellow who is always there when needed. One of his dreams is to fly. With the help of his friend Dr. Cecil, he tries again and again to fly, and eventually is told that the reason he can't is because ducks became too terrestrial. Bill's main appearance difference, apart from his smallness, is his bow tie which he changes every year at the Ducktown Picnic. Bill lives in an apartment with his pet [[Blue-and-yellow macaw|parrot]], Jerry. He's been called a \"gator lover\" for his rare efforts to turn alligators into allies of Ducktown.\n*'''Aldo''' ([[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]]) \u2013 A lumbering but kind-hearted [[American alligator|alligator]] from the town of Swampwood. He's Bill's best friend, though he often receives grief from his fellow gators on being a \"duck lover\". Has a blind Uncle Artie and a baby cousin Andy. Once was the cook at the bowling ball factory, he transferred to the assembly line after he befriended Bill, as he didn't want to cook any more ducks. He also fights urges so won't eat ducks. \n*'''Bev''' ([[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 Owner of the Decoy Cafe, where many ducks go to eat. She's a sweet duck who also has an alias, Madam Bevousky, as whom she offers [[fortune telling]] services to the residents of Ducktown. She is also the focus of Bill's romantic interests.\n*'''Ed, Oly and Waddle''' ([[Louis Chirillo]], [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]] and [[Jay Brazeau]]) \u2013 Three brothers and friends of Bill who live next door to him. These three goofy & lazy freeloaders are similar to [[the Three Stooges]] and tend to scheme their way into things and are usually the ones behind some prank or plot, from which they always try to distance themselves when things go awry. Ed wears a tropical shirt and speaks with a [[New York (state)|New York]] [[accent]]. Oly wears a green [[beret]] and speaks with a \"[[beatnik]]\" accent. Waddle is the shortest and fattest and has a more childlike voice.\n*'''Cecil''' ([[Ian James Corlett]]) \u2013 Ducktown's only [[dentist]] and an [[inventor]], Cecil speaks with a [[British]] accent and is always there to offer advice to Bill or the others. Naturally, Aldo is typically his only customer, being the only person in town who actually has teeth. He also provides beak adjustments for the ducks. \n*'''Claire''' \u2013 Cecil's wife who was scared of alligators, just like Aldo in the first episode.\n*'''Fred''' ([[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]]) \u2013 a melancholy, but sometimes nervously hyper [[Adelie penguin|penguin]], who migrated from [[Antarctica]] to Ducktown (possibly to get away from the [[killer whales]] & [[leopard seals]]), in which he has a citizenship. He's somewhat of a loner most of the time, always seen surrounding himself with bags of ice or air conditioning to remain comfortable in the intolerable (to him) heat. Has a duck girlfriend, Dot Cable, and a fashionable cousin, Gelata.\n*'''Raoul''' ([[Michael Benyaer]]) \u2013 A [[Hispanic]] [[crow]] who tends to be the freeloading troublemaker in Ducktown, and likes trading insults with Bill. He especially enjoys mocking Bill's attempts to fly.\n*'''Drill Sergeant Duck''' ([[Cathy Weseluck]]) \u2013 A tough police duck who makes it hard for Aldo to come into Ducktown, as she also is the leader of the ''Duck Defense League,'' an anti-gator organization.\n*Other characters that have appeared in the show have been voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]], [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]], [[Sylvia Zaradic]], [[Chantal Strand]], [[Chiara Zanni]], [[Pauline Newstone]], [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], [[Lee Tockar]], [[Garry Chalk (actor)|Garry Chalk]], [[Jay Brazeau]], and [[Scott McNeil]].\n\n==Merchandise==\n''Sitting Ducks'' proved to be a big hit with the European children's show market, and as a result toys, clothing and other merchandise were created.

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]].

A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.\n<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev, Lev N., Lemanskii, Aleksander A. |first1=. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 [in Russian] |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[Impedance matching|impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[angle of incidence]]. In 1911, Macdonald H.M. proposed nearly self-evident approach.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hector Muaro |title=The Effect Produced by an Obstacle on a Train of Electric Waves (A Perfectly Absorbing Obstacle) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1912 |volume=212 |issue=Series A |pages=484-496 |url=http://doi.org/10.1098/rsta1913.0010}}</ref> He used two well formulated problems in electrodynamics-  that of reflection from ideal metal:  \n: <math> \\mathbf E_{\\tau} = 0 </math>,\nand that of reflection from ideal magnetic:\n: <math> \\mathbf H_{\\tau} = 0 </math>.\nHalf-sum of solutions is the field around the black-body in  Macdonald's model. The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography <ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />. \n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]]. Therefore, the problem is got to be spacious  instead of surface one. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sommerfeld |first1=Arnold |title=Theoretishes \u00fcber die Beugung der R\u00f6ntgen Strahlen |journal=Zeitchrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik- Wikisource |date=1901 |volume=Band 46 |pages=ss.11-97 |url=http://de.wikisource.org>wiki>Zeitschrift_f\u00fcr_Ma}}</ref>\n\nThe idea to continue physical space was developed later.

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems with changing sign of the magnetic component. In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scatter of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babine's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics, for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions  is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916-920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 |url=https://www.link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01031726}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234-238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru_1979_ 234-238.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]]. The famous [[Schwarzschild metric]] looks mathematically  simple:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\left (1-\\frac{r_s}{4R}\\right)^2}{\\left (1+\\frac{r_s}{4R}\\right )^2}dt^2 + \\left (1+\\frac{r_s}{4R}\\right)^2 (dx^2+dy^2+dz^2)</math>,\nwhere <math>\\mathbf R = (x,y,z) </math> is radius-vector, <math> r_s  </math> is  [[Schwarzschild metric|the Schwarzschild]] radius i.e. radius of black-hole. \nFrom  point of view of concept based on the adjunct space , it is useful to apply the following transformation  of physical space:<ref name=\"Efimov\"/>\n:<math> \\boldsymbol \\rho = \\frac{ a^2\\mathbf R}{R^2} </math>,\nwhere <math> a </math> is radius of sphere that adjunct space is attached to. Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball with radius <math> a </math>. In that case, well known singularity point <math> R =0 </math>  is disappeared. \n===Black-body of arbitrary form===\n[[Anechoic chamber|Non-reflecting chamber]] has absolutely absorbing walls. Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton, J.A., Chu, L.J. |title=Diffraction Theory of Electromagnetic Waves |journal=Physical Review, Am.

Fields on the surface are bound by [[Green's function]] in two points - <math>\\mathbf x</math> and <math>\\mathbf y </math>:\n:<math> G(\\mathbf {x,y}) = \\frac{\\exp (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid})}{4 \\pi (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid}) }.    </math>\nLet be charges (or radiation sources) are placed in non-reflecting chamber i.e. in free space. Green's formula defines field <math> u(\\mathbf x) </math> in adjunct space by boundary values on the surface of non-reflecting chamber. Upon sending argument <math>\\mathbf x</math> on the surface, formula gives boundary condition:\n:<math> \\frac {u(\\mathbf x)}{2}= \\iint\\limits_{S,\\, y \\neq x    }\\left[ { G(\\mathbf{x,y})\\frac { \\partial u(\\mathbf y)}{\\partial n_y} -u(\\mathbf y) \\frac{\\partial G(\\mathbf{x,y)}  }{\\partial n_y  }       }\\right]        \\,dS_y   .</math>\nThe [[surface integral|surface integral]]    is calculated in the sense of [[Hadamard regularization]]. Normal <math> n_y </math> is directed outside of chamber i.e. in side of convexity of surface. Vector <math> \\mathbf x </math> lays on the surface.\n\nBoundary condition for convex black-body (for example ball) is the same. It is necessary however to take the  normal directed outside of convex surface.\n\nAt last, boundary condition for arbitrary surface, containing convex  and concave  parts, conserves its form under condition that normal is directed into side of convexity. Therefore, the normal changes its sign on different parts of surface.\n\n==Realizations==\nA ''realization'' of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01950 Viney Ghai, Harpreet Singh, and Prabhat K. Agnihotri, ''Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces,'' ACS Applied Nano Particles]</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the radius of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.\n<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev, Lev N., Lemanskii, Aleksander A. |first1=. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 [in Russian] |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[Impedance matching|impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[angle of incidence]]. In 1911, Macdonald H.M. proposed nearly self-evident approach.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hector Muaro |title=The Effect Produced by an Obstacle on a Train of Electric Waves (A Perfectly Absorbing Obstacle) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1912 |volume=212 |issue=Series A |pages=484-496 |url=http://doi.org/10.1098/rsta1913.0010}}</ref> He used two well formulated problems in electrodynamics-  that of reflection from ideal metal:  \n: <math> \\mathbf E_{\\tau} = 0 </math>,\nand that of reflection from ideal magnetic:\n: <math> \\mathbf H_{\\tau} = 0 </math>.\nHalf-sum of solutions is the field around the black-body in  Macdonald's model. The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface forming convex and concave parts of surface allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography <ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />. \n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]]. Therefore, the problem is got to be spacious  instead of surface one. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sommerfeld |first1=Arnold |title=Theoretishes \u00fcber die Beugung der R\u00f6ntgen Strahlen |journal=Zeitchrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik- Wikisource |date=1901 |volume=Band 46 |pages=ss.11-97 |url=http://de.wikisource.org>wiki>Zeitschrift_f\u00fcr_Ma}}</ref>\n\nThe idea to continue physical space was developed later. In 1978, Sergei P. Efimov from [[Bauman Moscow State Technical  University]] found that Macdonald's model is equivalent to that with symmetrical adjunct space. \n<ref name=\"Efimov>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Absolutely black-body in diffraction theory |journal=Engineering and Electronic Physics |date=1978 |volume=23 |issue=Jan. |pages=6-13 |url=http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978RaEI...23....7E}}</ref>\nThe spaces  are connected formally on the surface of black-body. Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems with changing sign of the magnetic component. In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scatter of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babine's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics, to diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions  is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916-920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 |url=https://www.link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01031726}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234-238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru_1979_ 234-238.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]].

Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball with radius <math> a </math>. In that case, well known singularity point <math> R =0 </math>  is disappeared. \n===Black-body of arbitrary form===\n[[Anechoic chamber|Non-reflecting chamber]] has absolutely absorbing walls. Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton, J.A., Chu, L.J. |title=Diffraction Theory of Electromagnetic Waves |journal=Physical Review, Am.

Fields on the surface are bound by [[Green's function]] in two points - <math>\\mathbf x</math> and <math>\\mathbf y </math>:\n:<math> G(\\mathbf {x,y}) = \\frac{\\exp (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid})}{4 \\pi (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid}) }.    </math>\nLet be charges (or radiation sources) are placed in non-reflecting chamber i.e. in free space. Green's formula defines field <math> u(\\mathbf x) </math> in adjunct space by boundary values on the surface of non-reflecting chamber. Upon sending argument <math>\\mathbf x</math> on the surface, formula gives boundary condition:\n:<math> \\frac {u(\\mathbf x)}{2}= \\iint\\limits_{S,\\, y \\neq x    }\\left[ { G(\\mathbf{x,y})\\frac { \\partial u(\\mathbf y)}{\\partial n_y} -u(\\mathbf y) \\frac{\\partial G(\\mathbf{(x,y)}  }{\\partial n_y  }       }\\right]        \\,dS_y   .</math>\nThe [[surface integral|surface integral]]    is calculated in the sense of [[Hadamard regularization]]. Normal <math> n_y </math> is directed outside of chamber i.e. in side of convexity of surface.\n\nBoundary condition for convex black-body (for example ball) is the same. It is necessary however to take the  normal directed outside of convex surface.\n\nAt last, boundary condition for arbitrary surface, containing convex  and concave  parts, conserves its form under condition that normal is directed into side of convexity. Therefore, the normal changes its sign on different parts of surface.\n\n==Realizations==\nA ''realization'' of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01950 Viney Ghai, Harpreet Singh, and Prabhat K. Agnihotri, ''Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces,'' ACS Applied Nano Particles]</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the radius of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].

The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was \u201cto commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom\u2013the liberation of the Philippines.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.\n\n[[File:Carlos P. Romulo (on the left) and Arthur A. Shuck.jpg|thumb|Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck presenting to [[Carlos P. Romulo]] a miniature of the Statue of Liberty in April 1950.]]\n\nThe eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.\n\nThe statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as \u201can expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill.\u201d Not surprisingly, their 40th anniversary theme was \u201cStrengthen the Arm of Liberty.\u201d\n\nMiniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. In fact, the Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to [[Carlos P. Romulo]], then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were \u201cEngineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the [[Rizal Park]], and on the center island rotunda between the [[Old Legislative building]] and [[Manila City Hall]].\u201d\n\nIn the end, the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] (BSP) erected the statue just outside [[Intramuros]]. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in [[Mt. Makiling]] which would serve as the statue's home for two decades or so.\n\nIn a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.\n\nTurns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in [[Manila]]. In the 1930s, one of Manila's biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: [[Andres Bonifacio]] on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.\n\n[[File:Souvenir postcard featuring the L.R. Aguinaldo Building in Juan Luna St., Manila.jpg|thumb|Established by the Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the L.R.

The multi-story building's facade featured a statue of Andres Bonifacio on the right and a replica of the statue of Liberty on the left.]]\n\nEstablished by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo's Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo's son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.\n\nThe Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store's furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo's succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.\n\nSince the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in [[Pangasinan]] and as far as [[Camp John Hay]] amphitheater in [[Baguio City]].\n\n===Thailand===\n\nThe Mini Siam and Mini Europe [[Miniature park|model village]], in [[Pattaya]], has a miniature Statue of Liberty amongst others.\n\n===Taiwan===\nThere are at least two Statue of Liberty replicas (greater than 30 feet in height) in [[Taiwan]].

The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was \u201cto commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom\u2013the liberation of the Philippines.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.\n\n[[File:Carlos P. Romulo (on the left) and Arthur A. Shuck.jpg|thumb|Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck presenting to [[Carlos P. Romulo]] a miniature of the Statue of Liberty in April 1950.]]\n\nThe eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.\n\nThe statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as \u201can expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill.\u201d Not surprisingly, their 40th anniversary theme was \u201cStrengthen the Arm of Liberty.\u201d\n\nMiniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. In fact, the Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to [[Carlos P. Romulo]], then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were \u201cEngineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the [[Rizal Park]], and on the center island rotunda between the [[Old Legislative building]] and [[Manila City Hall]].\u201d\n\nIn the end, the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] (BSP) erected the statue just outside [[Intramuros]]. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in [[Mt. Makiling]] which would serve as the statue's home for two decades or so.\n\nIn a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.\n\nTurns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in [[Manila]]. In the 1930s, one of Manila's biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: [[Andres Bonifacio]] on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.\n\n[[File:Souvenir postcard featuring the L.R. Aguinaldo Building in Juan Luna St., Manila.jpg|thumb|Established by the Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium was once one of the biggest shopping stores in pre-war Manila, located in Juan Luna Street, Manila. The multi-story building's facade featured a statue of Andres Bonifacio on the right and a replica of the statue of Liberty on the left.]]\n\nEstablished by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo's Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo's son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.\n\nThe Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store's furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo's succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.\n\nSince the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in [[Pangasinan]] and as far as [[Camp John Hay]] amphitheater in [[Baguio City]].\n\n===Thailand===\n\nThe Mini Siam and Mini Europe [[Miniature park|model village]], in [[Pattaya]], has a miniature Statue of Liberty amongst others.\n\n===Taiwan===\nThere are at least two Statue of Liberty replicas (greater than 30 feet in height) in [[Taiwan]]. These two statues are in the cities of [[Keelung]] and [[Taipei]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Sandy H. \u4f55\u8056\u6b23 |url=http://sandyintaiwan.blogspot.com/2007/08/statues-of-liberty.html#links |title=Sandy's Neipu Notebook: Statues of Liberty |website=Blogspot.com |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nFrom 1887 to 1945, [[Hanoi]] was home to another copy of the statue.

Sampson]], commanding the North Atlantic Squadron from {{USS|New York|ACR-2|2}} (Armored Cruiser No. 2), deployed his fleet in preparation for a blockade of the [[Cuba]]n coast. Three days later, the United States [[Declaration of war|declared war]] on Spain, beginning the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. ''Terror'', which had arrived off [[Cardenas de Cuba|Cardenas, Cuba]], on the 24th, captured a Cuban vessel\u2014''Almansas''\u2014on the first day of hostilities, but later released her. Over the next two days, the monitor took two Spanish ships, ''Ambrosia Bolivar'' and ''Guido'', and sent the prizes to [[Florida]].\n\nMeanwhile, the whereabouts of the Spanish Navy's ''Caribbean Squadron'' under [[Admiral]] [[Pascual Cervera y Topete|Pascual Cervera]] prompted concern in naval circles in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Intelligence estimates which reached Sampson noted that the Spanish fleet had departed the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]] on the morning of 29 April. Sampson reacted by deciding to meet Cervera's fleet at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], the nearest Spanish base in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. With his flag in ''New York'', Rear Admiral Sampson scraped together a makeshift squadron\u2014which included ''Terror'' and a sistership, {{USS|Amphitrite|1883|2}} (Monitor No. 2), as well as battleships {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|2}} (Battleship No. 4) and {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|2}}  (Battleship No. 1), {{USS|Porter|TB-6|2}} (Torpedo Boat No. 6), two auxiliaries and a collier\u2014and departed Key West on 3 May.\n\n''Terror'' and ''Amphitrite'' broke down frequently en route and materially delayed Sampson's passage. At one point, ''New York'' took both ''Terror'' and ''Porter'' in tow. Upon arrival off San Juan on 12 May, the Americans found only a couple of minor Spanish gunboats in the harbor. In order to \"develop their positions and strength\", Sampson decided to conduct a brief bombardment of the shore defenses. The squadron stood in for their target at 04:00, on 12 May 1898, with the ships cleared for action and the lights of the town clearly visible in the predawn darkness. Sounding general quarters at 05:00, the Americans opened fire within 15 minutes, and the Spanish began returning fire at 05:23.\n\n''Terror'' stood in, fifth in column, duelling with the Spanish shore batteries in a spirited engagement for the next three hours. As the action wore on, a tremendous volume of white smoke restricted visibility and caused the Admiral to signal \"use large guns only\" to cut down on the volume of smoke.\n\n''Terror'' expended thirty-one 10-inch shells in three firing passes against the fortifications at San Juan, and scored a direct hit on a battery which the monitor's commanding officer, Capt. Nicholl Ludlow, considered \"the most vicious\". ''Terror'', which had moved close inshore to gain a better firing position, kept up a spirited fire until 08:15, when she broke off action and rejoined Sampson's squadron retiring to the northwest.\n\nThe monitor subsequently resumed her cruising operations in the West Indies and off Puerto Rico for the duration of hostilities with Spain, into September 1898.

Proper sanitation is needed to maintain the visual clarity of water and to prevent the transmission of infectious [[waterborne diseases]].\n\n==Methods==\nTwo distinct and separate methods are employed in the sanitation of a swimming pool. The [[water filter|consecutive dilution system]] to allow the removal of [[pollutant|organic waste]] on a daily basis by using the sieve baskets inside the skimmer and circulation pump and the sand unit with a backwash facility for easy removal of organic waste from the water circulation.

When any of these pool chemicals are used, it is very important to keep the pH of the pool in the range 7.2 to 7.8&nbsp;\u2013 according to the Langelier Saturation Index, or 7.8 to 8.2&nbsp;\u2013 according to the Hamilton Index; higher pH drastically reduces the sanitizing power of the chlorine due to reduced [[Reduction potential|oxidation-reduction potential]] (ORP), while lower pH causes bather discomfort, especially to the eyes. However, according to the Hamilton Index, a higher pH can reduce unnecessary chlorine consumption while still remaining effective at preventing algae and bacteria growth.\n\nTo help ensure the health of bathers and protect pool equipment, it is essential to perform routine monitoring of water quality factors (or \"parameters\") on a regular basis. This process becomes the essence of an optimum water quality management program.\n\n==Systems and disinfection methods==\n\n===Chlorine and bromine methods===\n\nConventional halogen-based oxidizers such as [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]] are convenient and economical primary sanitizers for swimming pools and provide a residual level of sanitizer that remains in the water. Chlorine-releasing compounds are the most popular and frequently used in swimming pools whereas bromine-releasing compounds have found heightened popularity in spas and hot tubs. Both are members of the [[halogen]] group with demonstrated ability to destroy and deactivate a wide range of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses in swimming pools and spas. Both exhibit three essential elements as ideal first-line-of-defense sanitizers for swimming pools and spas: they are fast-acting and enduring, they are effective algaecides, and they oxidize undesired contaminants.\n\nSwimming pools can be disinfected with a variety of chlorine-releasing compounds. The most basic of these compounds is molecular chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>); however, its application is primarily in large commercial public swimming pools. Inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds frequently used in residential and public swimming pools include [[sodium hypochlorite]] commonly known as liquid bleach or simply [[bleach]], [[calcium hypochlorite]] and [[lithium hypochlorite]]. Chlorine residuals from Cl<sub>2</sub> and inorganic chlorine-releasing compounds break down rapidly in [[sunlight]]. To extend their disinfectant usefulness and persistence in outdoor settings, swimming pools treated with one or more of the inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds can be supplemented with [[cyanuric acid]]&nbsp;\u2013 a granular stabilizing agent capable of extending the [[active chlorine]] residual [[half-life]] (t<sub>\u00bd</sub>) by four to sixfold.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/publications/books/housing/cha14.htm |title=Healthy Housing Reference Manual, Chapter 14: Residential Swimming Pools and Spas |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=25 May 2009 |work=CDC.gov |publisher=Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> Chlorinated isocyanurates, a family of organic chlorine-releasing compounds, are stabilized to prevent UV degradation due to the presence of cyanurate as part of their chemical backbone.\n\nChlorine reacting with [[urea]] in urine and other nitrogen-containing wastes from bathers can produce [[chloramines]]. Chloramines typically occur when an insufficient amount of chlorine is used to disinfect a contaminated pool. Chloramines are generally responsible for the noxious, irritating smell prominently occurring in indoor pool settings. A common way to remove chloramines is to \"superchlorinate\" (commonly called \"shocking\") the pool with a high dose of inorganic chlorine sufficient to deliver 10 ppm chlorine. Regular superchlorination (every two weeks in summer) helps to eliminate these unpleasant odors in the pool. Levels of chloramines and other volatile compounds in water can be minimized by reducing contaminants that lead to their formation (e.g., urea, creatinine, amino acids and personal care products) as well as by use of non-chlorine \"shock oxidizers\" such as [[potassium peroxymonosulfate]].\n\nMedium pressure UV technology is used to control the level of chloramines in indoor pools.  It is also used as a secondary form of disinfection to address chlorine tolerant pathogens.  A properly sized and maintained UV system should remove the need to shock for chloramines, although shocking would still be used to address a fecal accident in the pool.  UV will not replace chlorine, but is used to control the level of chloramines, which are responsible for the odor, irritation, and enhanced corrosion at an indoor pool.\n\n===Copper ion system===\nCopper ion systems use a [[low voltage]] current across [[copper]] bars (solid copper, or a mixture of copper and [[zinc]] or [[silver]]) to free copper ions into the flow of pool water to kill [[organisms]] such as [[algae]] in the water and provide a \"residual\" in the water. Alternative systems also use [[titanium]] plates to produce [[oxygen]] in the water to help degrade [[organic compound]]s.\n\n==Private pool filtration==\n\n===Water pumps===\nAn electrically operated water [[pump]] is the prime motivator in recirculating the water from the pool. Water is forced through a filter and then returned to the pool. Using a water pump by itself is often not sufficient to completely sanitize a pool. Commercial and public pool pumps usually run 24 hours a day for the entire operating season of the pool. Residential pool pumps are typical run for 4 hours per day in winter (when the pool is not in use) and up to 24 hours in summer. To save electricity costs, most pools run water pumps for between 6 hours and 12 hours in summer with the pump being controlled by an electronic [[timer]].\n\nMost pool pumps available today incorporate a small filter basket as the last effort to avoid leaf or hair contamination reaching the close-tolerance impeller section of the pump.\n\n===Filtration units===\n\n====Sand====\nA pressure-fed [[sand filter]] is typically placed in line immediately after the water pump. The filter typically contains a medium such as graded sand (called '14/24 Filter Media' in the UK system of grading the size of sand by sifting through a fine brass-wire mesh of 14 to the inch (5.5 per centimeter) to 24 to the inch (9.5 per cm)). A pressure fed sand filter is termed a 'High Rate' sand filter, and will generally filter turbid water of particulates no less than 10 [[micrometre|micrometers]] in size.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/filters.html|title=Types of Filters|website=water.me.vccs.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> The [[rapid sand filter]] type are periodically 'back washed' as contaminants reduce water flow and increase back pressure. Indicated by a pressure gauge on the pressure side of the filter reaching into the 'red line' area, the pool owner is alerted to the need to 'backwash' the unit. The sand in the filter will typically last five to seven years before all the \"rough edges\" are worn off and the more tightly packed sand no longer works as intended {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Recommended filtration for public/commercial pools are 1 ton sand per 100,000 liters water (10 ounces avdp. per cubic foot of water) [7.48 US or 6.23 UK gallons].\n\nIntroduced in the early 1900s was another type of sand filter; the 'Rapid Sand' filter, whereby water was pumped into the top of a large volume tank (3' 0\" or more cube) (1 cubic yard/200US gal/170UK gal/770 liters) containing filter grade sand, and returning to the pool through a pipe at the bottom of the tank. As there is no pressure inside this tank, they were also known as 'gravity filters'. These type of filters are not greatly effective, and are no longer common in home swimming pools, being replaced by the pressure-fed type filter.\n\n====Diatomaceous earth====\nSome filters use [[diatomaceous earth]] to help filter out contaminants. Commonly referred to as 'D.E.' filters, they exhibit superior filtration capabilities.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/publications/books/housing/cha14.htm#Filters National Center for Environmental Health: Healthy Housing Reference Manual \u2013 Residential Pool and Spa Filters]</ref> Often a D.E. filter will trap waterborne contaminants as small as 1 micrometer in size. D.E. filters are banned in some states, as they must be emptied out periodically and the contaminated media flushed down the sewer, causing a problem in some districts' sewage systems.\n\n====Cartridge filters====\nOther filter media that have been introduced to the residential swimming pool market since 1970 include sand particles and paper type cartridge filters of 50 to {{convert|150|sqft|m2}} filter area arranged in a tightly packed 12\" diameter x 24\" long (300&nbsp;mm x 600&nbsp;mm) accordion-like circular cartridge. These units can be 'daisy-chained' together to collectively filter almost any size home pool. The cartridges are typically cleaned by removal from the filter body and hosing-off down a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] connection. They are popular where backwashed water from a sand filter is not allowed to be discharged or goes into the [[aquifer]].\n\n====Automated pool cleaners====\n[[File:Angel Saavedra and Joshua Caslill, both lifeguards, clean around the pool deck while a skimmer cleans the bottom of the pool during preparations for the 2010 swimming season at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas 100520-F-SS509-010.jpg|thumb|upright|Automated pool cleaner]]\n[[Automated pool cleaners]] more commonly known as \"Automatic pool cleaners\" and in particular electric, robotic pool cleaners provide an extra measure of filtration, and in fact like the handheld vacuums can microfilter a pool, which a sand filter without flocculation or coagulalents is unable to accomplish<ref>James E. Amburgey, Kimberly J. Walsh, Roy R. Fielding and Michael J. Arrowood ''Removal of Cryptosporidium and polystyrene microspheres from swimming pool water with sand, cartridge, and precoat filters'', IWA Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nThese cleaners are independent from the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high rate of speed back into the pool water. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and \"brushes\" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.<ref>American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Volume 11, April 1912, Issue 4, Read at the Annual meeting of the Association, held in Havana, December 1911</ref><ref>''Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places'' Prepared by the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers and the Engineering and Sanitation Section of the American Public Health Association 1957</ref>\n\n====Other systems====\n{{see also|Salt water chlorination}}\n[[Salt water chlorination|Saline chlorination]] units, electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with [[ultra-violet]] lamp systems, and \"Tri-Chlor Feeders\" are other independent or auxiliary systems for swimming pool sanitation.\n\n====Consecutive dilution====\nA consecutive dilution system is arranged to remove organic waste in stages after it passes through the skimmer. Waste matter is trapped inside one or more sequential skimmer basket sieves, each having a finer mesh to further dilute contaminant size.  Dilution here is defined as the action of making something weaker in force, content, or value.\n\nThe first basket is placed closely after the skimmer mouth.  The second is attached to the circulation pump. Here the 25% of water drawn from the main drain at the bottom of the swimming pool meets the 75% drawn from the surface. The circulation pump sieve basket is easily accessible for service and is to be emptied daily. The third sieve is the sand unit. Here smaller organic waste that has slipped through the previous sieves is trapped by sand.\n\nIf not removed regularly, organic waste will continue to rot down and affect water quality. The dilution process allows organic waste to be easily removed.  Ultimately the sand sieve can be backwashed to remove smaller trapped organic waste which otherwise leaches ammonia and other compounds into the recirculated water.  These additional solutes eventually lead to the formation of [[disinfection by-products]] (DBP's). The sieve baskets are easily removed daily for cleaning as is the sand unit, which should be back-washed at least once a week. A perfectly maintained consecutive dilution system drastically reduces the build-up of chloramines and other DBP's. The water returned to the pool should have been cleared of all organic waste above 10 microns in size.\n\n====Mineral sanitizers====\nMineral sanitizers for the [[swimming pool]] and [[spa]] use [[mineral]]s, [[metal]]s, or [[chemical element|elements]] derived from the natural environment to produce [[water quality]] benefits that would otherwise be produced by harsh or synthetic [[chemical]]s.\n\nCompanies are not allowed to sell a mineral sanitizer in the United States unless it has been registered with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Currently two mineral sanitizers are registered with the EPA: one is a silver salt with a controlled release mechanism which is applied to calcium carbonate granules that help neutralize pH; the other uses a colloidal form of silver released into water from ceramic beads.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NTB/is_24_44/ai_n15969728/</ref>\n\nMineral technology takes advantage of the cleansing and [[Water filter|filtering]] qualities of commonly occurring substances. [[Silver]] and [[copper]] are well-known [[Oligodynamic effect|oligodynamic]] substances that are effective in destroying [[pathogen]]s. Silver has been shown to be effective against harmful [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[protozoa]] and [[fungus|fungi]]. Copper is widely used as an [[algae|algicide]]. [[Alumina]], derived from aluminates, filters detrimental materials at the molecular level, and can be used to control the delivery rate of desirable metals such as copper. Working through the pool or spa filtration system, mineral sanitizers use combinations of these minerals to inhibit [[algae]] growth and eliminate contaminants.\n\nUnlike [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]], metals and minerals do not evaporate, and do not degrade. Minerals can make the water noticeably [[water softener|softer]], and by replacing harsh chemicals in the water they lower the potential for red-eye, [[dry skin]] and foul odors.\n\n===Skimmers===\n\n====Coping apertures====\nWater is typically drawn from the pool via a rectangular aperture in the wall,  connected through to a device fitted into one (or more) wall/s of the pool. The internals of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangle lid, about one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational water is drawn from the pool over a floating hinged [[weir]] (operating from a vertical position to 90 degrees angle away from the pool, in order to stop leaves and debris being back-flooded into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable \"skimmer basket\", the purpose of which is to entrap leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris.\n\nThe aperture visible from the pool side is typically 1' 0\" (300&nbsp;mm) wide by 6\" (150&nbsp;mm) high, which intersects the water midway though the center of the aperture. Skimmers with apertures wider than this are termed \"wide angle\" skimmers and may be as much as 2' 0\" wide (600&nbsp;mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by the level of the water as these are adjusted to work with the rate of pump suction and will retain optimum skimming regardless of water level leading to a markedly reduced amount of bio-material in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid blockages in the pipes leading to the pump and filter.\n\n===Pool re-circulation===\nWater returning from the consecutive dilution system is passed through return jets below the surface. These are designed to impact a turbulent flow as the water enters the pool. This flow as a force is far less than the mass of water in the pool and takes the least pressure route upward where eventually surface tension reforms it into a laminar flow on the surface.\n\nAs the returned water disturbs the surface, it creates a capillary wave. If the return jets are positioned correctly, this wave creates a circular motion within the surface tension of the water, allowing that on the surface to slowly circulate around the pool walls. Organic waste floating on the surface through this circulation from the capillary wave is slowly drawn past the mouth of the skimmer where it is pulled in due to the laminar flow and surface tension over the skimmer weir. In a well-designed pool, circulation caused by the disturbed returned water aids in removing organic waste from the pool surface, directing it to be trapped inside the consecutive dilution system for easy disposal.\n\nMany return jets are equipped with a swivel nozzle.  Used correctly, it induces deeper circulation, further cleaning the water.  Turning the jet nozzles at an angle imparts rotation within the entire depth of pool water.  Orientation to the left or right would generate clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation respectively.  This has the benefit of cleaning the bottom of the pool and slowly moving sunken inorganic debris to the main drain where it is removed by the circulation pump basket sieve.\n\nIn a correctly constructed pool, rotation of the water caused by the manner it is returned from the consecutive dilution system will reduce or even waive the need to vacuum the bottom. To gain the maximum rotation force on the main body of water, the consecutive dilution system needs to be as clean and unblocked as possible to allow maximum flow pressure from the pump. As the water rotates, it also disturbs organic waste at lower water layers, forcing it to the top.  Rotational force the pool return jets create is the most important part of cleaning the pool water and pushing organic waste across the mouth of the skimmer.\n\nWith a correctly designed and operated swimming pool, this circulation is visible and after a period of time, reaches even the deep end, inducing a low-velocity vortex above the main drain due to suction. Correct use of the return jets is the most effective way of removing disinfection by-products caused by deeper decomposing organic waste and drawing it into the consecutive dilution system for immediate disposal.\n\n====Heaters====\nOther equipment which may be optioned in the recirculation system include pool water heaters. They can be [[heat pump]]s, natural gas or propane [[gas heater]]s, electric heaters, wood burning heaters, or [[Solar hot water panel]] heaters \u2013 increasingly used in the [[sustainable design]] of pools.\n\n====Other equipment====\nDiversions to electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with [[ultra-violet]] lamp systems, and \"Tri-Chlor Feeders\" are other auxiliary systems for Swimming pool sanitation; as well as [[solar panel]]s; are in most cases required to be placed after the filtration equipment, and are the last items before the water is returned to the pool.\n\n==Other features==\n\n===Recreation amenities===\n\nFeatures that are part of the water circulation system can extend treatment capacity needs for sizing calculations and can include: artificial [[stream]]s and [[waterfall]]s, in-pool [[fountain]]s, integrated [[hot tub]]s and spas, [[water slide]]s and sluices, artificial \"pebble beaches\", submerged seating as bench-ledges or as \"stools\" at in-pool bars, [[plunge pool]]s, and shallow children's wading pools.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Automated pool cleaners]]\n* [[Copper ion swimming pool system]]\n* [[Fountain]]\n* [[Reflecting pool]]\n* [[Respiratory risks of indoor swimming pools]]\n* [[Water garden]]\n* [[Water purification]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swimming Pool Sanitation}}\n[[Category:Swimming pools]]\n[[Category:Swimming pool equipment]]\n[[Category:Water filters]]\n[[Category:Water treatment]]\n[[Category:Water technology]]\n\n[[da:Filter (vand)]]\n", "text_old": "'''Swimming pool sanitation''' is the process of ensuring healthy conditions in [[swimming pool]]s.

When any of these pool chemicals are used, it is very important to keep the pH of the pool in the range 7.2 to 7.8&nbsp;\u2013 according to the Langelier Saturation Index, or 7.8 to 8.2&nbsp;\u2013 according to the Hamilton Index; higher pH drastically reduces the sanitizing power of the chlorine due to reduced [[Reduction potential|oxidation-reduction potential]] (ORP), while lower pH causes bather discomfort, especially to the eyes. However, according to the Hamilton Index, a higher pH can reduce unnecessary chlorine consumption while still remaining effective at preventing algae and bacteria growth.\n\nTo help ensure the health of bathers and protect pool equipment, it is essential to perform routine monitoring of water quality factors (or \"parameters\") on a regular basis. This process becomes the essence of an optimum water quality management program.\n\n==Systems and disinfection methods==\n\n===Chlorine and bromine methods===\n\nConventional halogen-based oxidizers such as [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]] are convenient and economical primary sanitizers for swimming pools and provide a residual level of sanitizer that remains in the water. Chlorine-releasing compounds are the most popular and frequently used in swimming pools whereas bromine-releasing compounds have found heightened popularity in spas and hot tubs. Both are members of the [[halogen]] group with demonstrated ability to destroy and deactivate a wide range of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses in swimming pools and spas. Both exhibit three essential elements as ideal first-line-of-defense sanitizers for swimming pools and spas: they are fast-acting and enduring, they are effective algaecides, and they oxidize undesired contaminants.\n\nSwimming pools can be disinfected with a variety of chlorine-releasing compounds. The most basic of these compounds is molecular chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>); however, its application is primarily in large commercial public swimming pools. Inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds frequently used in residential and public swimming pools include [[sodium hypochlorite]] commonly known as liquid bleach or simply [[bleach]], [[calcium hypochlorite]] and [[lithium hypochlorite]]. Chlorine residuals from Cl<sub>2</sub> and inorganic chlorine-releasing compounds break down rapidly in [[sunlight]]. To extend their disinfectant usefulness and persistence in outdoor settings, swimming pools treated with one or more of the inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds can be supplemented with [[cyanuric acid]]&nbsp;\u2013 a granular stabilizing agent capable of extending the [[active chlorine]] residual [[half-life]] (t<sub>\u00bd</sub>) by four to sixfold.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/publications/books/housing/cha14.htm |title=Healthy Housing Reference Manual, Chapter 14: Residential Swimming Pools and Spas |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=25 May 2009 |work=CDC.gov |publisher=Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> Chlorinated isocyanurates, a family of organic chlorine-releasing compounds, are stabilized to prevent UV degradation due to the presence of cyanurate as part of their chemical backbone.\n\nChlorine reacting with [[urea]] in urine and other nitrogen-containing wastes from bathers can produce [[chloramines]]. Chloramines typically occur when an insufficient amount of chlorine is used to disinfect a contaminated pool. Chloramines are generally responsible for the noxious, irritating smell prominently occurring in indoor pool settings. A common way to remove chloramines is to \"superchlorinate\" (commonly called \"shocking\") the pool with a high dose of inorganic chlorine sufficient to deliver 10 ppm chlorine. Regular superchlorination (every two weeks in summer) helps to eliminate these unpleasant odors in the pool. Levels of chloramines and other volatile compounds in water can be minimized by reducing contaminants that lead to their formation (e.g., urea, creatinine, amino acids and personal care products) as well as by use of non-chlorine \"shock oxidizers\" such as [[potassium peroxymonosulfate]].\n\nMedium pressure UV technology is used to control the level of chloramines in indoor pools.  It is also used as a secondary form of disinfection to address chlorine tolerant pathogens.  A properly sized and maintained UV system should remove the need to shock for chloramines, although shocking would still be used to address a fecal accident in the pool.  UV will not replace chlorine, but is used to control the level of chloramines, which are responsible for the odor, irritation, and enhanced corrosion at an indoor pool.\n\n===Copper ion system===\nCopper ion systems use a [[low voltage]] current across [[copper]] bars (solid copper, or a mixture of copper and [[zinc]] or [[silver]]) to free copper ions into the flow of pool water to kill [[organisms]] such as [[algae]] in the water and provide a \"residual\" in the water. Alternative systems also use [[titanium]] plates to produce [[oxygen]] in the water to help degrade [[organic compound]]s.\n\n==Private pool filtration==\n\n===Water pumps===\nAn electrically operated water [[pump]] is the prime motivator in recirculating the water from the pool. Water is forced through a filter and then returned to the pool. Using a water pump by itself is often not sufficient to completely sanitize a pool. Commercial and public pool pumps usually run 24 hours a day for the entire operating season of the pool. Residential pool pumps are typical run for 4 hours per day in winter (when the pool is not in use) and up to 24 hours in summer. To save electricity costs, most pools run water pumps for between 6 hours and 12 hours in summer with the pump being controlled by an electronic [[timer]].\n\nMost pool pumps available today incorporate a small filter basket as the last effort to avoid leaf or hair contamination reaching the close-tolerance impeller section of the pump.\n\n===Filtration units===\n\n====Sand====\nA pressure-fed [[sand filter]] is typically placed in line immediately after the water pump. The filter typically contains a medium such as graded sand (called '14/24 Filter Media' in the UK system of grading the size of sand by sifting through a fine brass-wire mesh of 14 to the inch (5.5 per centimeter) to 24 to the inch (9.5 per cm)). A pressure fed sand filter is termed a 'High Rate' sand filter, and will generally filter turbid water of particulates no less than 10 [[micrometre|micrometers]] in size.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/filters.html|title=Types of Filters|website=water.me.vccs.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> The [[rapid sand filter]] type are periodically 'back washed' as contaminants reduce water flow and increase back pressure. Indicated by a pressure gauge on the pressure side of the filter reaching into the 'red line' area, the pool owner is alerted to the need to 'backwash' the unit. The sand in the filter will typically last five to seven years before all the \"rough edges\" are worn off and the more tightly packed sand no longer works as intended {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Recommended filtration for public/commercial pools are 1 ton sand per 100,000 liters water (10 ounces avdp. per cubic foot of water) [7.48 US or 6.23 UK gallons].\n\nIntroduced in the early 1900s was another type of sand filter; the 'Rapid Sand' filter, whereby water was pumped into the top of a large volume tank (3' 0\" or more cube) (1 cubic yard/200US gal/170UK gal/770 liters) containing filter grade sand, and returning to the pool through a pipe at the bottom of the tank. As there is no pressure inside this tank, they were also known as 'gravity filters'. These type of filters are not greatly effective, and are no longer common in home swimming pools, being replaced by the pressure-fed type filter.\n\n====Diatomaceous earth====\nSome filters use [[diatomaceous earth]] to help filter out contaminants. Commonly referred to as 'D.E.' filters, they exhibit superior filtration capabilities.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/publications/books/housing/cha14.htm#Filters National Center for Environmental Health: Healthy Housing Reference Manual \u2013 Residential Pool and Spa Filters]</ref> Often a D.E. filter will trap waterborne contaminants as small as 1 micrometer in size. D.E. filters are banned in some states, as they must be emptied out periodically and the contaminated media flushed down the sewer, causing a problem in some districts' sewage systems.\n\n====Cartridge filters====\nOther filter media that have been introduced to the residential swimming pool market since 1970 include sand particles and paper type cartridge filters of 50 to {{convert|150|sqft|m2}} filter area arranged in a tightly packed 12\" diameter x 24\" long (300&nbsp;mm x 600&nbsp;mm) accordion-like circular cartridge. These units can be 'daisy-chained' together to collectively filter almost any size home pool. The cartridges are typically cleaned by removal from the filter body and hosing-off down a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] connection. They are popular where backwashed water from a sand filter is not allowed to be discharged or goes into the [[aquifer]].\n\n====Automated pool cleaners====\n[[File:Angel Saavedra and Joshua Caslill, both lifeguards, clean around the pool deck while a skimmer cleans the bottom of the pool during preparations for the 2010 swimming season at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas 100520-F-SS509-010.jpg|thumb|upright|Automated pool cleaner]]\n[[Automated pool cleaners]] more commonly known as \"Automatic pool cleaners\" and in particular electric, robotic pool cleaners provide an extra measure of filtration, and in fact like the handheld vacuums can microfilter a pool, which a sand filter without flocculation or coagulalents is unable to accomplish<ref>James E. Amburgey, Kimberly J. Walsh, Roy R. Fielding and Michael J. Arrowood ''Removal of Cryptosporidium and polystyrene microspheres from swimming pool water with sand, cartridge, and precoat filters'', IWA Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nThese cleaners are independent from the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high rate of speed back into the pool water. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and \"brushes\" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.<ref>American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Volume 11, April 1912, Issue 4, Read at the Annual meeting of the Association, held in Havana, December 1911</ref><ref>''Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places'' Prepared by the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers and the Engineering and Sanitation Section of the American Public Health Association 1957</ref>\n\n====Other systems====\n{{see also|Salt water chlorination}}\n[[Salt water chlorination|Saline chlorination]] units, electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with [[ultra-violet]] lamp systems, and \"Tri-Chlor Feeders\" are other independent or auxiliary systems for swimming pool sanitation.\n\n====Consecutive dilution====\nA consecutive dilution system is arranged to remove organic waste in stages after it passes through the skimmer. Waste matter is trapped inside one or more sequential skimmer basket sieves, each having a finer mesh to further dilute contaminant size.  Dilution here is defined as the action of making something weaker in force, content, or value.\n\nThe first basket is placed closely after the skimmer mouth.  The second is attached to the circulation pump. Here the 25% of water drawn from the main drain at the bottom of the swimming pool meets the 75% drawn from the surface. The circulation pump sieve basket is easily accessible for service and is to be emptied daily. The third sieve is the sand unit. Here smaller organic waste that has slipped through the previous sieves is trapped by sand.\n\nIf not removed regularly, organic waste will continue to rot down and affect water quality. The dilution process allows organic waste to be easily removed.  Ultimately the sand sieve can be backwashed to remove smaller trapped organic waste which otherwise leaches ammonia and other compounds into the recirculated water.  These additional solutes eventually lead to the formation of [[disinfection by-products]] (DBP's). The sieve baskets are easily removed daily for cleaning as is the sand unit, which should be back-washed at least once a week. A perfectly maintained consecutive dilution system drastically reduces the build-up of chloramines and other DBP's. The water returned to the pool should have been cleared of all organic waste above 10 microns in size.\n\n====Mineral sanitizers====\nMineral sanitizers for the [[swimming pool]] and [[spa]] use [[mineral]]s, [[metal]]s, or [[chemical element|elements]] derived from the natural environment to produce [[water quality]] benefits that would otherwise be produced by harsh or synthetic [[chemical]]s.\n\nCompanies are not allowed to sell a mineral sanitizer in the United States unless it has been registered with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Currently two mineral sanitizers are registered with the EPA: one is a silver salt with a controlled release mechanism which is applied to calcium carbonate granules that help neutralize pH; the other uses a colloidal form of silver released into water from ceramic beads.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NTB/is_24_44/ai_n15969728/</ref>\n\nMineral technology takes advantage of the cleansing and [[Water filter|filtering]] qualities of commonly occurring substances. [[Silver]] and [[copper]] are well-known [[Oligodynamic effect|oligodynamic]] substances that are effective in destroying [[pathogen]]s. Silver has been shown to be effective against harmful [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[protozoa]] and [[fungus|fungi]]. Copper is widely used as an [[algae|algicide]]. [[Alumina]], derived from aluminates, filters detrimental materials at the molecular level, and can be used to control the delivery rate of desirable metals such as copper. Working through the pool or spa filtration system, mineral sanitizers use combinations of these minerals to inhibit [[algae]] growth and eliminate contaminants.\n\nUnlike [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]], metals and minerals do not evaporate, and do not degrade. Minerals can make the water noticeably [[water softener|softer]], and by replacing harsh chemicals in the water they lower the potential for red-eye, [[dry skin]] and foul odors.\n\n===Skimmers===\n\n====Coping apertures====\nWater is typically drawn from the pool via a rectangular aperture in the wall,  connected through to a device fitted into one (or more) wall/s of the pool. The internals of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangle lid, about one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational water is drawn from the pool over a floating hinged [[weir]] (operating from a vertical position to 90 degrees angle away from the pool, in order to stop leaves and debris being back-flooded into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable \"skimmer basket\", the purpose of which is to entrap leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris.\n\nThe aperture visible from the pool side is typically 1' 0\" (300&nbsp;mm) wide by 6\" (150&nbsp;mm) high, which intersects the water midway though the center of the aperture. Skimmers with apertures wider than this are termed \"wide angle\" skimmers and may be as much as 2' 0\" wide (600&nbsp;mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by the level of the water as these are adjusted to work with the rate of pump suction and will retain optimum skimming regardless of water level leading to a markedly reduced amount of bio-material in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid blockages in the pipes leading to the pump and filter.\n\n===Pool re-circulation===\nWater returning from the consecutive dilution system is passed through return jets below the surface. These are designed to impact a turbulent flow as the water enters the pool. This flow as a force is far less than the mass of water in the pool and takes the least pressure route upward where eventually surface tension reforms it into a laminar flow on the surface.\n\nAs the returned water disturbs the surface, it creates a capillary wave. If the return jets are positioned correctly, this wave creates a circular motion within the surface tension of the water, allowing that on the surface to slowly circulate around the pool walls. Organic waste floating on the surface through this circulation from the capillary wave is slowly drawn past the mouth of the skimmer where it is pulled in due to the laminar flow and surface tension over the skimmer weir. In a well-designed pool, circulation caused by the disturbed returned water aids in removing organic waste from the pool surface, directing it to be trapped inside the consecutive dilution system for easy disposal.\n\nMany return jets are equipped with a swivel nozzle.  Used correctly, it induces deeper circulation, further cleaning the water.  Turning the jet nozzles at an angle imparts rotation within the entire depth of pool water.  Orientation to the left or right would generate clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation respectively.  This has the benefit of cleaning the bottom of the pool and slowly moving sunken inorganic debris to the main drain where it is removed by the circulation pump basket sieve.\n\nIn a correctly constructed pool, rotation of the water caused by the manner it is returned from the consecutive dilution system will reduce or even waive the need to vacuum the bottom. To gain the maximum rotation force on the main body of water, the consecutive dilution system needs to be as clean and unblocked as possible to allow maximum flow pressure from the pump. As the water rotates, it also disturbs organic waste at lower water layers, forcing it to the top.  Rotational force the pool return jets create is the most important part of cleaning the pool water and pushing organic waste across the mouth of the skimmer.\n\nWith a correctly designed and operated swimming pool, this circulation is visible and after a period of time, reaches even the deep end, inducing a low-velocity vortex above the main drain due to suction. Correct use of the return jets is the most effective way of removing disinfection by-products caused by deeper decomposing organic waste and drawing it into the consecutive dilution system for immediate disposal.\n\n====Heaters====\nOther equipment which may be optioned in the recirculation system include pool water heaters. They can be [[heat pump]]s, natural gas or propane [[gas heater]]s, electric heaters, wood burning heaters, or [[Solar hot water panel]] heaters \u2013 increasingly used in the [[sustainable design]] of pools.\n\n====Other equipment====\nDiversions to electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with [[ultra-violet]] lamp systems, and \"Tri-Chlor Feeders\" are other auxiliary systems for Swimming pool sanitation; as well as [[solar panel]]s; are in most cases required to be placed after the filtration equipment, and are the last items before the water is returned to the pool.\n\n==Other features==\n\n===Recreation amenities===\n\nFeatures that are part of the water circulation system can extend treatment capacity needs for sizing calculations and can include: artificial [[stream]]s and [[waterfall]]s, in-pool [[fountain]]s, integrated [[hot tub]]s and spas, [[water slide]]s and sluices, artificial \"pebble beaches\", submerged seating as bench-ledges or as \"stools\" at in-pool bars, [[plunge pool]]s, and shallow children's wading pools.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Automated pool cleaners]]\n* [[Copper ion swimming pool system]]\n* [[Fountain]]\n* [[Reflecting pool]]\n* [[Respiratory risks of indoor swimming pools]]\n* [[Water garden]]\n* [[Water purification]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swimming Pool Sanitation}}\n[[Category:Swimming pools]]\n[[Category:Swimming pool equipment]]\n[[Category:Water filters]]\n[[Category:Water treatment]]\n[[Category:Water technology]]\n\n[[da:Filter (vand)]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContaminants and disease:Add missing pipe", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool_sanitation"}
