It is the principal city of the Battle Creek, Michigan [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which encompasses all of Calhoun County. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 52,347, while the MSA's population was 136,146.\n\n==History and name origin==\nIn about 1774, the [[Potawatomi]] and the Ottawa [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes formed a joint village near the future Battle Creek, Michigan.<ref>R. David Edmonds, ''The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire'' (Norman:University of Oklahoma, 1978), p. 99</ref>\n\nBattle Creek was named for a minor encounter on March 14, 1824, between a federal government land survey party led by Colonel [[John Mullett]] and two Potawatomi Indians, who had approached the survey camp asking for [[food]]. They were hungry because the Army was late in delivering the supplies promised them by the treaty of 1820. After a protracted discussion, the Native Americans allegedly tried to steal food. One of the surveyors grabbed his rifle and shot one of the Potawatomies, seriously wounding him. Following the encounter, the surveyors retreated to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=61|title=A Brief History of Battle Creek|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.heritagebattlecreek.org}}</ref>\n \nSurveyors would not return to the area until June 1825, after Governor [[Lewis Cass]] had settled the issues with the Native Americans. Early white settlers called the nearby stream the [[Battle Creek River]], and the town took its name from that.<ref name=\"Peirce\">{{cite book |last=Peirce |first=Henry B. |title=History of Calhoun county, Michigan |origyear=1877 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad0868.0001.001 |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |page=79 |chapter=The City of Battle Creek |chapterurl=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;idno=bad0868.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=119 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~micalhou/battlecreek.htm History of Battle Creek Township and City], Calhoun County MIGenWen (Michigan Genealogy on the Web), accessed January 25, 2008</ref><ref name=\"Romig\">{{cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}</ref><ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm Battle Creek history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161649/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.willard.lib.mi.us/bc.html A Thumbnail History of Battle Creek and Calhoun County, Michigan], Willard Library.

By this account, the name ''Waupakisco'' or ''Waupokisco'' was a reference to an earlier battle fought between Native American tribes before the arrival of white settlers. However, Virgil J. Vogel establishes that this native term had \"nothing to do with blood or battle\".<ref name=\"Peirce\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5d5wS7so14C&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=battle+creek+name+origin&source=web&ots=VaQav_UozE&sig=oA31UESmxR2ebI9PlwquP3Tg940#PPA153,M1 |title=Indian names in Michigan, origin of \"Battle Creek\" |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing removal of the Potawatomi to a reservation, the first permanent white settlements in Battle Creek Township began about 1831. Migration had increased to Michigan from New York and New England following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York in 1824. Most settlers chose to locate on the Goguac prairie, which was fertile and easily cultivated.  A post office was opened in Battle Creek in 1832 under Postmaster Pollodore Hudson.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FS7nJ3FOAIC&pg=PA16 History and Direction of Calhoun County] Accessed January 20, 2011</ref> The first school was taught in a small [[log house]] about 1833 or 1834.  Asa Langley built the first [[sawmill]] in 1837.  A brick manufacturing plant, called the oldest enterprise in the township, was established in 1840 by Simon Carr and operated until 1903.  The township was established by act of the legislature in 1839.<ref>Ringes, Laura (1913). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XdZWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA169 \"Battle Creek Township\"].

The Lewis Publishing Company.</ref>\n\nIn the [[antebellum era]], the city was a major stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], used by [[fugitive slave]]s to escape to freedom in Michigan and [[Canada]].  It was the chosen home of noted abolitionist [[Sojourner Truth]] after her escape from slavery.<ref>Heritage Battle Creek website, http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/   Accessed August 29, 2013</ref>\n\nBattle Creek figured prominently in the early history of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. It was the site of a Protestant church founding convention in 1863. The denomination's first hospital, college, and publishing office would also be constructed in the city. When the hospital and publishing office burned down in 1902, the church elected to decentralize, and most of its institutions were relocated. The first Adventist church (rebuilt in the 1920s) is still in operation.\n\nWorld Heavyweight Champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] was once arrested here for marrying his White wife and transporting her across state lines.<ref name=\"battlecreekracearrest\">{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=NIck |title=Pardoned heavyweight champion Jack Johnson was arrested in Battle Creek |url=https://eu.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/2018/05/24/pardoned-heavyweight-champ-jack-johnson-arrested-battle-creek/641457002/ |accessdate=20 November 2019 |publisher=Battle Creek Enquirer}}</ref>\n\nThe city was noted for its focus on health reform during the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Battle Creek Sanitarium|The Battle Creek Sanitarium]] was founded by Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]].  In addition to some of his sometimes bizarre treatments that were featured in the movie ''[[The Road to Wellville (film)|The Road to Wellville]]'', Kellogg also funded organizations that promoted [[eugenics]] theories at the core of their philosophical agenda.  The Better Race Institute was one of these organizations.  He also supported the \"[[separate but equal]]\" philosophy and invited [[Booker T. Washington]] to speak at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in order to raise money. Washington was the author of the speech \"[[Atlanta compromise|The Atlanta Compromise]]\", which solidified his position of being an [[Atlanta compromise|accommodationist]] while providing a mechanism for southern Whites (and their sympathizers), to fund his school ([[Tuskegee University|the Tuskegee Institute]]).\n\n[[W. K. Kellogg]] had worked for his brother in a variety of capacities at the B.C. Sanitarium.  Tired of living in his brother's shadow, he struck out on his own, going to the boom-towns surrounding the oilfields in [[Oklahoma]] as a broom salesman.  Having failed, he returned to work as an assistant to his brother (John Harvey).  While working at the sanitariums' laboratory, W.K. spilled liquefied cornmeal on a heating device that cooked the product and rendered it to flakes.  He tasted the flakes and added milk to them.  He was able to get his brother to allow him to give some of the product to some of the patients at the sanitarium, and the patients' demand for the product exceeded his expectations to the point that W.K made the decision to leave the sanitarium. Along with some investors, he built a factory to satisfy the demand for his \"[[corn flakes]]\".\n\nAs W. K. Kellogg's wealth began to exceed his brother's, he funded some of his projects that were at the sanitarium. One of these was the Better Race Institute, a eugenics-based organization. During this time, John Harvey Kellogg became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. One of the tenets of the fraternity is that \"Masonry recognizes the internal character of a man, not the external\". John Harvey Kellogg stopped funding his brother's projects and established equal pay policies in his company. He also led [[desegregation]] efforts by allowing black children to swim in his home pool. He funded many school and philanthropic projects throughout the city, and founded [[Andrews University]] in [[Berrien Springs, Michigan|Berrien Springs]], Michigan.\n\nIt was during this time of going their separate ways for good that Dr. John Harvey Kellogg sued his brother for copyright infringement. The U.S. Supreme court ruled in W.K. Kellogg's favor.\n\nInspired by Kellogg's innovation, [[C. W. Post]] invented [[Grape-Nuts]] and founded his own cereal company in the town. Battle Creek has been nicknamed \"the Cereal City.\"\n\nIn the turbulent 1960s, Battle Creek was not immune to the racial issues of the day. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] spoke here, as did Sen. [[Hubert Humphrey]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B. Johnson]], and Heavyweight Champion of the world [[Muhammad Ali]]. African Americans were subjected to \"[[stop and frisk]]\" procedures while walking, and housing covenants were in full force.  No Blacks worked in the school systems, and only a few Blacks held mid-level manager posts in the local corporate sector.  The Federal government sector was better at the Federal Center, and less so at the local Veterans' Administration Hospital.\n\nThe Black Recondos, a group formed from the local young adult council of the [[NAACP]], forced the local board of education to hire Black teachers and administrative personnel, under the threat of removing every black student from their public schools. They also forced the chief of police to allow Black Recondos to intervene in arrests and gave them the authority to take black law breakers into their custody instead of the local police. This caused the second [[police strike|strike of a police force]] in U.S. history. The officers were fired and the strike was ended.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|43.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|42.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water,<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220065340/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> making Battle Creek the third largest city in Michigan by area, and one of only three [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] municipalities in the state over {{convert|40|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size.\n\n*Approximately 60% of the city's land is developed.

Cities that follow this plan of government have an elected commission (or council) that appoints a professionally trained and experienced manager to administer the day-to-day operations of the city and to make recommendations to the city commission. Battle Creek also appoints a City Attorney, who provides legal counsel to the city manager and City Commission.\n\nThe City Commission makes all policy decisions, including review, revision and final approval of the annual budget, which is proposed annually by the City Manager. The City Manager serves as an \"at-will\" employee and he works under an employment contract with the commission. All other city employees, with the exception of the City Attorney's staff, are under the supervision of the City Manager.\n\nThere are five ward commissioners. Residents cast votes for a ward representative, who must live within the area they are representing, as well as for four at-large commissioners. These candidates may live anywhere in the city. All commissioners serve two-year terms and all terms begin and end at the same election. The last commission election was in fall 2015.\n\nEach November, the commission holds a special meeting to decide which commissioners serve as mayor and vice mayor for the next year. The mayor presides over the commission meetings and appoints commissioners and residents to special committees. He may also form special committees to explore community challenges or potential policies. The vice mayor stands in if the mayor is unavailable.<ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm Battle Creek government description.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213220059/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan State University, city of East Lansing at odds over proposed income tax|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/michigan_state_university_city.html|access-date=August 16, 2017|work=MLive Lansing|publisher=Mlive Media Group|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Largest employers===\nAccording to the City's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit+reports/FY+2011/City+of+Battle+Creek+CAFR+63011.pdf |title=City of Battle Creek 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |format=PDF |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701230538/http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit%2Breports/FY%2B2011/City%2Bof%2BBattle%2BCreek%2BCAFR%2B63011.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2014 }}</ref> the largest employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Parts of the base were spun off and developed as the Battle Creek Veteran's Hospital, [[Fort Custer National Cemetery]], [[Fort Custer Recreation Area]] and Fort Custer Industrial Park. This industrial park contains more than 90 different companies.\n\nThe [[United States Government]] still owns the land, under an arrangement by which the state of Michigan administers and manages the property. The base, which is still mostly undeveloped, wooded land, takes up a sizable portion of Battle Creek's land area.  The part of the base in Battle Creek that is now the industrial park measures {{convert|4.69|sqmi|km2|2}} in area, which is approximately 10.6% of the city's area.  A much larger part of the base lies in [[Kalamazoo County, Michigan|Kalamazoo County]]. The adjoining [[W.K.

It is the principal city of the Battle Creek, Michigan [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which encompasses all of Calhoun County. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 52,347, while the MSA's population was 136,146.\n\n==History and name origin==\nIn about 1774, the [[Potawatomi]] and the Ottawa [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes formed a joint village near the future Battle Creek, Michigan.<ref>R. David Edmonds, ''The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire'' (Norman:University of Oklahoma, 1978), p. 99</ref>\n\nBattle Creek was named for a minor encounter on March 14, 1824, between a federal government land survey party led by Colonel [[John Mullett]] and two Potawatomi Indians, who had approached the survey camp asking for [[food]]. They were hungry because the Army was late in delivering the supplies promised them by the treaty of 1820. After a protracted discussion, the Native Americans allegedly tried to steal food. One of the surveyors grabbed his rifle and shot one of the Potawatomies, seriously wounding him. Following the encounter, the surveyors retreated to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=61|title=A Brief History of Battle Creek|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.heritagebattlecreek.org}}</ref>\n \nSurveyors would not return to the area until June 1825, after Governor [[Lewis Cass]] had settled the issues with the Native Americans. Early white settlers called the nearby stream the [[Battle Creek River]], and the town took its name from that.<ref name=\"Peirce\">{{cite book |last=Peirce |first=Henry B. |title=History of Calhoun county, Michigan |origyear=1877 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad0868.0001.001 |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |page=79 |chapter=The City of Battle Creek |chapterurl=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;idno=bad0868.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=119 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~micalhou/battlecreek.htm History of Battle Creek Township and City], Calhoun County MIGenWen (Michigan Genealogy on the Web), accessed January 25, 2008</ref><ref name=\"Romig\">{{cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}</ref><ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm Battle Creek history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161649/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.willard.lib.mi.us/bc.html A Thumbnail History of Battle Creek and Calhoun County, Michigan], Willard Library.

By this account, the name ''Waupakisco'' or ''Waupokisco'' was a reference to an earlier battle fought between Native American tribes before the arrival of white settlers. However, Virgil J.

Migration had increased to Michigan from New York and New England following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York in 1824. Most settlers chose to locate on the Goguac prairie, which was fertile and easily cultivated.  A post office was opened in Battle Creek in 1832 under Postmaster Pollodore Hudson.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FS7nJ3FOAIC&pg=PA16 History and Direction of Calhoun County] Accessed January 20, 2011</ref> The first school was taught in a small [[log house]] about 1833 or 1834.

It was the chosen home of noted abolitionist [[Sojourner Truth]] after her escape from slavery.<ref>Heritage Battle Creek website, http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/   Accessed August 29, 2013</ref>\n\nBattle Creek figured prominently in the early history of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. It was the site of a Protestant church founding convention in 1863. The denomination's first hospital, college, and publishing office would also be constructed in the city. When the hospital and publishing office burned down in 1902, the church elected to decentralize, and most of its institutions were relocated. The first Adventist church (rebuilt in the 1920s) is still in operation.\n\nWorld Heavyweight Champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] was once arrested here for marrying his White wife and transporting her across state lines.<ref name=\"battlecreekracearrest\">{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=NIck |title=Pardoned heavyweight champion Jack Johnson was arrested in Battle Creek |url=https://eu.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/2018/05/24/pardoned-heavyweight-champ-jack-johnson-arrested-battle-creek/641457002/ |accessdate=20 November 2019 |publisher=Battle Creek Enquirer}}</ref>\n\nThe city was noted for its focus on health reform during the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Battle Creek Sanitarium|The Battle Creek Sanitarium]] was founded by Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]].  In addition to some of his sometimes bizarre treatments that were featured in the movie ''[[The Road to Wellville (film)|The Road to Wellville]]'', Kellogg also funded organizations that promoted [[eugenics]] theories at the core of their philosophical agenda.  The Better Race Institute was one of these organizations.  He also supported the \"[[separate but equal]]\" philosophy and invited [[Booker T. Washington]] to speak at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in order to raise money. Washington was the author of the speech \"[[Atlanta compromise|The Atlanta Compromise]]\", which solidified his position of being an [[Atlanta compromise|accommodationist]] while providing a mechanism for southern Whites (and their sympathizers), to fund his school ([[Tuskegee University|the Tuskegee Institute]]).\n\n[[W. K. Kellogg]] had worked for his brother in a variety of capacities at the B.C. Sanitarium.  Tired of living in his brother's shadow, he struck out on his own, going to the boom-towns surrounding the oilfields in [[Oklahoma]] as a broom salesman.  Having failed, he returned to work as an assistant to his brother (John Harvey).  While working at the sanitariums' laboratory, W.K. spilled liquefied cornmeal on a heating device that cooked the product and rendered it to flakes.  He tasted the flakes and added milk to them.  He was able to get his brother to allow him to give some of the product to some of the patients at the sanitarium, and the patients' demand for the product exceeded his expectations to the point that W.K made the decision to leave the sanitarium. Along with some investors, he built a factory to satisfy the demand for his \"[[corn flakes]]\".\n\nAs W. K. Kellogg's wealth began to exceed his brother's, he funded some of his projects that were at the sanitarium. One of these was the Better Race Institute, a eugenics-based organization. During this time, John Harvey Kellogg became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. One of the tenets of the fraternity is that \"Masonry recognizes the internal character of a man, not the external\". John Harvey Kellogg stopped funding his brother's projects and established equal pay policies in his company. He also led [[desegregation]] efforts by allowing black children to swim in his home pool. He funded many school and philanthropic projects throughout the city, and founded [[Andrews University]] in [[Berrien Springs, Michigan|Berrien Springs]], Michigan.\n\nIt was during this time of going their separate ways for good that Dr. John Harvey Kellogg sued his brother for copyright infringement. The U.S. Supreme court ruled in W.K. Kellogg's favor.\n\nInspired by Kellogg's innovation, [[C. W. Post]] invented [[Grape-Nuts]] and founded his own cereal company in the town. Battle Creek has been nicknamed \"the Cereal City.\"\n\nIn the turbulent 1960s, Battle Creek was not immune to the racial issues of the day. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] spoke here, as did Sen. [[Hubert Humphrey]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B. Johnson]], and Heavyweight Champion of the world [[Muhammad Ali]]. African Americans were subjected to \"[[stop and frisk]]\" procedures while walking, and housing covenants were in full force.  No Blacks worked in the school systems, and only a few Blacks held mid-level manager posts in the local corporate sector.  The Federal government sector was better at the Federal Center, and less so at the local Veterans' Administration Hospital.\n\nThe Black Recondos, a group formed from the local young adult council of the [[NAACP]], forced the local board of education to hire Black teachers and administrative personnel, under the threat of removing every black student from their public schools. They also forced the chief of police to allow Black Recondos to intervene in arrests and gave them the authority to take black law breakers into their custody instead of the local police. This caused the second [[police strike|strike of a police force]] in U.S. history. The officers were fired and the strike was ended.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|43.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|42.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water,<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220065340/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> making Battle Creek the third largest city in Michigan by area, and one of only three [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] municipalities in the state over {{convert|40|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size.\n\n*Approximately 60% of the city's land is developed.

Cities that follow this plan of government have an elected commission (or council) that appoints a professionally trained and experienced manager to administer the day-to-day operations of the city and to make recommendations to the city commission. Battle Creek also appoints a City Attorney, who provides legal counsel to the city manager and City Commission.\n\nThe City Commission makes all policy decisions, including review, revision and final approval of the annual budget, which is proposed annually by the City Manager. The City Manager serves as an \"at-will\" employee and he works under an employment contract with the commission. All other city employees, with the exception of the City Attorney's staff, are under the supervision of the City Manager.\n\nThere are five ward commissioners. Residents cast votes for a ward representative, who must live within the area they are representing, as well as for four at-large commissioners. These candidates may live anywhere in the city. All commissioners serve two-year terms and all terms begin and end at the same election. The last commission election was in fall 2015.\n\nEach November, the commission holds a special meeting to decide which commissioners serve as mayor and vice mayor for the next year. The mayor presides over the commission meetings and appoints commissioners and residents to special committees. He may also form special committees to explore community challenges or potential policies. The vice mayor stands in if the mayor is unavailable.<ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm Battle Creek government description.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213220059/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan State University, city of East Lansing at odds over proposed income tax|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/michigan_state_university_city.html|access-date=August 16, 2017|work=MLive Lansing|publisher=Mlive Media Group|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Largest employers===\nAccording to the City's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit+reports/FY+2011/City+of+Battle+Creek+CAFR+63011.pdf |title=City of Battle Creek 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |format=PDF |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701230538/http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit%2Breports/FY%2B2011/City%2Bof%2BBattle%2BCreek%2BCAFR%2B63011.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2014 }}</ref> the largest employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Making his debut in 1988, Wright took his time to prove his value as a first-round draftee but in 1990 he had a fantastic year which saw him rise in ranking amongst the top wingmen in the league.

In 1993 he was a victim of a disease which threatened his playing career, but he recovered in the pre-season to continue playing his damaging football on the wing. Consistent football followed in the mid-1990s before suffering a knee injury in 1996 against [[Richmond Tigers|Richmond]] where he would require a knee reconstruction. Following the season-ending injury, his main asset of pace was severely affected, and would play out his career in defence where his courage gave him an edge.

Works of Sudip Roy includes pencil sketches and water colours, charcoals and a heady series of landscape done in limped line drawing. Roy over the years mastered the art of watercolor and moved from landscapes to studies of architectural facades and association of people in historic temples and monuments. He moved to the capital city of Delhi in the mid 1990s.\n\nHis subjects remained architectural and figurative for most part of his life, until he shifted to moody momentousness. He started doing large abstracted works which reflected times of the day.\n\nVoluminous sweeps of colour, drawing concurrently on still perceptions, with a light hand and the melodious design of colour's vapid vacuous tonality, these works are, as if, Sudip's encounter with history of realism, abandoning and reconciling into the magic of Abstract Expressionism.\n\nHis work of art overlaps maximal instincts as well expressionist paintings. He discards an insistent flatness in favour of three-dimensionality, turning from the canvas to a series of densely coloured fragments delineated by strong contours.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n\nSudip Roy was born in [[Baharampur]], West Bengal and came to study at the [[Government College of Art & Craft]], Kolkata. At college he was known for attracting the attention of early collectors for his stylistic distinction in watercolours and expressionist drawings. He began his career as a young artist painting portraits and bold impressionistic landscapes, and architectural studies.\n\n===Career in contemporary art===\n\nDrawing upon those influences, he eventually forged the style of modern painting for which he is best known, a successful reinterpretation of traditional lean lithe  iconography by way of crisp, clean, modernist lines. He went on to become one of the most celebrated modernists in the history of Indian painting because he had gone through myriad methods including the wash paintings that called for more than thousand sweeps of wash effect.\n\nHe had his first solo show at Delhi in 1996 at Art Today, the exemplare gallery space for artists in Delhi, hit headlines in media because he sold out within a few hours.

Works of Sudip Roy includes pencil sketches and water colours, charcoals and a heady series of landscape done in limped line drawing. Roy over the years mastered the art of watercolor and moved from landscapes to studies of architectural facades and association of people in historic temples and monuments. He moved to the capital city of Delhi in the mid 90\u2019s.\n\nHis subjects remained architectural and figurative for most part of his life, until he shifted to moody momentousness. He started doing large abstracted works which reflected times of the day.\n\nVoluminous sweeps of colour, drawing concurrently on still perceptions, with a light hand and the melodious design of colour's vapid vacuous tonality, these works are, as if, Sudip's encounter with history of realism, abandoning and reconciling into the magic of Abstract Expressionism.\n\nHis work of art overlaps maximal instincts as well expressionist paintings. He discards an insistent flatness in favour of three-dimensionality, turning from the canvas to a series of densely coloured fragments delineated by strong contours.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n\nSudip Roy was born in [[Baharampur]], West Bengal and came to study at the [[Government College of Art & Craft]], Kolkata. At college he was known for attracting the attention of early collectors for his stylistic distinction in watercolours and expressionist drawings. He began his career as a young artist painting portraits and bold impressionistic landscapes, and architectural studies.\n\n===Career in contemporary art===\n\nDrawing upon those influences, he eventually forged the style of modern painting for which he is best known, a successful reinterpretation of traditional lean lithe  iconography by way of crisp, clean, modernist lines. He went on to become one of the most celebrated modernists in the history of Indian painting because he had gone through myriad methods including the wash paintings that called for more than thousand sweeps of wash effect.\n\nHe had his first solo show at Delhi in 1996 at Art Today, the exemplare gallery space for artists in Delhi, hit headlines in media because he sold out within a few hours. At Art Today were a few architectural watercolours and a few panoramic drawings done from his early college days.<ref>{{cite news |title=Calendar art, big name not enough to appeal-buyers |author=Suneet Chopra|url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/fe/daily/19980501/12155254.html |publisher=The Indian Express |date=1 May 1998 |accessdate=7 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\n\nHe is married to Mitra Roy, and has two sons.

During his stay in Athens, Hansen designed his first building, the [[National Observatory of Athens]] and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called \"Athenian Trilogy\": the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] and the [[National Library of Greece]], the third building of the trilogy being the [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens]], which was designed by his brother [[Christian Hansen (architect)|Hans Christian Hansen]] (1803\u20131883).<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/reputations-pen-portraits-/karl-friedrich-schinkel-1781-1841/10025236.article |title= Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841)|publisher=architectural-review.com |accessdate=May 1, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url= http://denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Norden/Christian_Hansen|title=   Christian Hansen\n|publisher= Den Store Danske, Gyldendal   |author= Ida Haugsted |accessdate=May 1, 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.greece-is.com/athenian-trilogy-perfection-form/  |title =Athenian Trilogy|website=greece-is.com  \n|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Greek-Austrian entrepreneur [[Georgios Sinas]] (1783-1856, who donated the observatory, called Hansen to Vienna in 1846, where Hansen took up an apprenticeship with noted Austrian architect [[Ludwig F\u00f6rster]] (1797\u20131863).\nIn his early works, such as the museum at [[Arsenal (Vienna)|The Arsenal in Vienna]], Hansen was still rather aligned to a more romantic style. In later years, he became the most outstanding representative of Renaissance-inspired historicism ([[Neo-Renaissance]]), which also came to be known as Viennese-style. This style extended into the smallest details of the interior design and partially accepted the courses of a synthesis of the arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/person/gnd/119509369|title=   Ludwig von F\u00f6rster |publisher= Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek |accessdate=May 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with F\u00f6rster and many others, Hansen was one of the most important and influential architects of the Viennese [[Ringstra\u00dfe]]. His most famous work is the [[Austrian Parliament Building|Austrian Parliament]] building, which was created in the style of an ancient, neo-classic temple, and serves to refer to the Greek beginnings of [[democracy]].  Hansen was originally a staunch critic of the Classical style that was taught to him at the Copenhagen Academy.  Over the years, however, he came to incorporate Classical elements into his forms.
