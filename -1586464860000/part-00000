(The series was adapted as a film, titled ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), also known as ''Frank Miller's Sin City''.)\n\n==Films==\n* Eunuchs appear often as villains in [[Hong Kong]] [[kung fu]] and [[wuxia]] films set in ancient China. For example, the films ''[[Dragon Inn]]'' (''Xin long men ke zhan''), ''[[Butterfly and Sword (film)|Butterfly and Sword]]'' (''Xin liu xing hu die jian''), and ''[[A Touch of Zen]]'' (''Hsia nu'') all feature a eunuch or a group of eunuchs as the main villain. A popular eunuch villain used in ancient China stories is Eunuch Wei, who is based on a historical figure named [[Wei Zhongxian]]. Eunuch villains are usually in charge of powerful political posts, such as being the leader of the East Chamber.\n* In [[Mel Brooks]]'s comedy ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981), under the section of \"The Roman Empire\", an entire scene is devoted to a joke about eunuchs, the length of African genitals, and the song, \"[[Caldonia]]\"; all rolled into one.\n* In the Disney animated film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), the character Chi-Fu is a royal advisor that has been attached to Captain Li Shang's forces.  Due to his nature as a royal advisor to the Emperor of China and the historical nature of the film, he would be assumed to be a eunuch.   \n* ''[[The Last Eunuch]]'' (1988), a Chinese biographical film directed by [[Zhang Zhiliang]], tells the story of [[Sun Yaoting]], who saw the last royal palace's extravagant lifestyle and experienced the breakdown of the last imperial empire and felt the new changes brought by the new age.\n* The film ''[[Farinelli (film)|Farinelli]]'' (1994) is about the castrato singer [[Farinelli]].\n* The documentary film ''Bombay Eunuch'' (2001) examines the changing role of India's [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]], some of whom are also eunuchs.\n* The documentary film ''American Eunuchs'' (2003) investigates the underworld of modern eunuchs in America.\n* In the film ''[[One Night With the King]]'' (2006), [[Esther|Hadassah]]'s (Esther's) would-be boyfriend, Jesse, is captured by the Persian empire and castrated.\n* The documentary film ''Kiss the Moon'' (2010), set in Pakistan, portrays three generations of eunuchs examining the ancient rituals and religious beliefs surrounding their community.\n* ''Nilkantho'' treats the plight of the Indian hijras with sensitivity.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n* In ''[[Murder 2]]'' (2011), by [[Emraan Hashmi]] , the antagonist castrates himself and becomes an eunuch.\n\n==Games==\n* In the video game ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'' (2015), the loyal servant and bookie of head Redanian Intelligence Sigismund Dijkstra is a eunuch, called Happen the Eunuch. He takes care of the Bathhouse in Novigrad, which is open to both sexes.\n\n==Literature==\n* ''[[The Alteration]]'' by [[Kingsley Amis]] is an \"alternative history\" set in 20th-century England about a boy soprano and eunuch. \n* Several tales of the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' focus on eunuchs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globusz.com/ebooks/1001v2/00000014.htm |title=Tale of the First Eunuch, Bukhayt |website=Globusz.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>\n* For the greater part of [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' (1984), the 16-year-old narrator [[Frank Cauldhame]] claims to be a eunuch, the result of being savaged by a dog when he was an infant. At the novel's climax, Frank discovers that he was, in fact, born female.\n* The character of the Pardoner in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', is implied to be a eunuch or homosexual.\n*Being proud of not being a eunuch is the subject of the song \"[[At Least You're Not a Eunuch]]\" in the play ''[[Life and Death in Jaffna]] (The Musical!)'' by [[Edward Cress]]\n* The Queen [[Salmissra]], in [[David Eddings]]' ''[[The Belgariad]]'' and ''[[The Malloreon]]'', is only allowed to be served by eunuchs. Her chief eunuch, Sadi, becomes a principal character in ''[[The Malloreon]]'', and is referred to in ''The Prophecy'' as \"The Man who is no Man.\"\n* Three best-selling [[crime fiction|crime novels]] by [[Jason Goodwin]], ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'' and its sequels, ''[[The Snake Stone]]'' and ''The Bellini Card'', are set in [[Istanbul]] in the 1830s, chronicle the investigations of [[Yashim Togalu]], a Turkish eunuch detective to the Sultan's royal court, in the [[Ottoman Empire]] of the 1830s.\n* Christopher Harris' historical novel ''[[Memoirs of a Byzantine Eunuch]]'' (2002) features a eunuch.\n* In [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story \"[[The Scarlet Citadel]]\", the main antagonist has a eunuch prison guard named Shukeli, in whom normal human passions have been replaced by extreme sadism.\n* The eunuch Manan is a major character in ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'', the second book from [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea]] series.

According to her, people should only eat when they feel real, physical hunger and stop when full; prayer and [[Bible]] reading will fill emotional needs instead of food. Overeating is equated with greed.
