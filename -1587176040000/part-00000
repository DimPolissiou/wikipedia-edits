They are kicked off the coach they were riding on because of Gotrek's comments toward the coach driver and especially his wife. As they continue to travel on foot, they are nearly run down by a black coach, and Gotrek vows to find it and hurt the driver. They reach the Standing Stones Inn, and are able to make their way through the barred door to learn of how on Geheimnisnacht a coven who are based in the Darkstone Ring steal children and other people for sacrifices. They learn that the son of the innkeeper, Gunter, and his wife have both disappeared, and so they vow to find the Darkstone Ring and destroy the coven and save Gunter and his wife. After finding the path to the Ring, they come across a rotting cultist who chants gibberish before being felled. They finally come across the Ring and coven and discover that the leader of the coven is the driver of the Black Coach. They listen in for a while and learn that it is dedicated to Slaanesh, Lord of Pleasure. They finally attack and destroy the coven as they intended to sacrifice a stolen baby, and in the aftermath they discover that Gunter and his wife were both cultists, and so are both dead. They rescue the baby, and move on... This story is frequently alluded to by Felix later in the series, as it was his first true glimpse at [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]].\n\n===Wolf Riders===\n\nThe story begins with Felix in a tavern protecting a girl from the attentions of three huge trappers: Hef, Kell, and Lars. He holds his own until Gotrek comes in and drives them out. The girl introduces herself as Kirsten, and explains how her family is part of the von Diehl migration, a cursed noble family and their servants and their families moving to the Border Lands. Gotrek and Felix were on their way to the Dwarf stronghold of Karak Eight-Peaks because of stories of treasure they had heard. They decide to join the von Diehls, as they are heading in the same general direction, and they could use the cover afforded by carts. After traveling through the Grey Mountains, and reaching the Border Lands, Felix falls deeply in love with Kirsten, and she likewise. While camped in the Cursed Hills, the camp is attacked by Undead warriors, and during the fight, Felix kills the trapper Lars, after he goes crazy and attacks him. The men drive off the Undead, and they set off to find a ruined fort, which Gotrek helps repair, hinting at his pre-slayer background as an engineer. Finally, the fort is attacked by Wolf Riders, led by a Goblin Shaman, and during the first siege, Gottfried, the leader of the von Diehls, is struck by an arrow and is carried off by his son, Deiter; his nephew, Manfred; Frau Winter, a sorceress; and Kirsten, Frau Winter's assistant, to be healed. After a day of no word from them, and with the second siege starting, Felix goes off to investigate, leaving Gotrek and the remaining men to fight off the horde ready to break through the gates. Felix comes across Frau Winter and Kirsten, the former who is dead and the latter who is dying. Felix watches her die, and swears to avenge her. He then comes across Dieter, whose head was bashed in, and enters Gottfired's room to see him stabbed to death in his bed with Manfred sitting there wiping off his blade. He then explains that the \"curse\" of the von Diehls was mutation brought on by a heretic cursing Manfred's grandfather. Manfred, going mad, explains that he broke the curse by killing all of the von Diehls. He and Felix duel, and Felix kills him, uttering \"The curse is broken\". He goes outside to see Gotrek standing on a pile of goblin, wolf and human bodies, including Hef and Kell. He single-handedly held the gate, killing the Shaman and losing his eye in the process. The surviving humans are taken in by one of the many Border Princes, whilst Gotrek and Felix leave, and the story ends...\n\n===The Dark Beneath the World===\n\nThe story continues immediately after 'Wolf Riders', with Felix and Gotrek travelling towards Karak Eight Peaks in search of treasure. On the way, they meet a party of men under attack from Orcs. The pair intervene and save the three survivors: Aldebrand, a zealous fanatic from the Templars of the Fiery Heart, Zauberlich, a sorcerer, and Jules, a Bretonnian scout, are also journeying to Karak Eight Peaks on a quest. The group decide to travel together. They arrive at a settlement built by the Dwarves close to the ruined city, and ask permission to enter the city, where they learn what the three men are searching for: a magical sword called Karaghul, an heirloom of the Order of the Fiery Heart, left in the city during a previous effort to reclaim part of the city by the Dwarves from the Goblins that infest it. The group are given leave to enter the city, but before they go, a Dwarven Priestess of Valaya warns them that great evil is stirring in the ruins of the city...\n\nThe group journey into the depths of the ruined city, battling with Goblins, Orcs, Skaven and Ogres that now infest the ruined halls. As they go deeper, they are followed by ghostly lights. Eventually, the lights reveal themselves as dwarven ghosts, who beg Gotrek to help them. When he asks what has happened, they say that an ancient and powerful evil has desecrated their tombs and dragged them back from their eternal rest in the Hall of Ancestors, and that unless it is slain and the tombs resanctified, they will never find their way back to eternal rest. Gotrek vows to aid them.\n\nThe group finally come to a great treasure room-the very one that Felix and Gotrek have been seeking. In pride of place is a great sword, which Aldebrand recognizes as Karaghul. However, before he can claim it, a huge creature bursts out and kills him, tearing his head from his shoulders. The creature is a great troll, tainted and corrupted by warpstone, twisted and mutated by the power of Chaos that it has become something far more terrible. Gotrek realizes they are in a Dwarven tomb, and that the troll's presence is the reason why the ghosts are stalking the ruins of Karak Eight Peaks. The group attack, but the troll has the ability to heal its wounds almost instantaneously, and they can only slow it. The troll kills Jules and Zauberlich, but not before the sorcerer learns that fire destroys the troll's ability to regenerate. As Gotrek keeps the beast distracted, Felix throws a lamp on it, which ignites, setting the beast on fire and letting Gotrek finally kill it.\n\nA huge army of Goblins arrives, attracted by the commotion. As Gotrek and Felix consign themselves to dying in battle, the ghosts of the tomb form up in a spectral army and attack the goblins, killing them with ease and causing the survivors to flee. Gotrek angrily says that the ghosts have denied him a heroic death, but they reply he is destined for a doom far greater...that is soon approaching. The ghosts bless him for his deed and disappear, finally at peace. Gotrek ignores the treasure, realizing that to take it would desecrate the tomb and raise the ghosts again, though Felix takes Karaghul in honour of their dead comrades. Leaving the bodies of their companions at rest in the tomb, the pair seal it and leave Karak Eight Peaks behind...\n\n===The Mark of Slaanesh===\n\nThe story picks up after they have left Karak Eight Peaks and come to a small village at the edge of the Drakwald Forest. The village is controlled by a gang of vicious thugs who are also cultists of [[Slaanesh]], who viciously beat up Felix in the village tavern shortly after his arrival. To make matters worse, in a battle with mutants on the road, Gotrek was struck on the head with a slingstone and is suffering [[amnesia]], no longer remembering who he is, nor who Felix is, or his quest to find a heroic death.\n\nFelix takes Gotrek to a local healer called Kryptmann, who promises to create a brew to restore Gotrek's mind, providing Felix brings back certain ingredients from the nearby mountains. Narrowly avoiding the Slaaneshi thugs and a roving band of mutants, Felix gathers the ingredients and brings them to Kryptmann. However, the brew has no effect, and Felix attacks Kryptmann, accusing the healer of lying to him. In the confusion, Gotrek receives another blow to the head, which restores his memory to him. With the Slayer restored to his wits, the pair go to the tavern and revenge themselves on the cultists...\n\n===Blood and Darkness===\n\nThe story begins with Gotrek and Felix passing through the Drakwald Forest. They find a young girl called Kat, the sole survivor of a beastman attack on her village. The beastmen were led by a female Chaos Champion of the Chaos God, [[Khorne]], who mysteriously spared Kat's life. The story then switches to the perspective of the female Chaos Champion, a woman called Justine, who turned to Chaos after being [[raped]] as a young woman by a nobleman. After many years in the Chaos Wastes, she returns to take her revenge, destroying the nobleman's castle with her army of beastmen and murdering the nobleman. Her army has then taken to raiding nearby villages: however, she has to find and kill Kat in order to become a Daemon Prince and achieve immortality, though she has misgivings about killing the girl (it is constantly hinted, and then finally confirmed later in the story, that she is in fact Kat's mother, a pregnancy caused by her rape).\n\nThe story then returns to Gotrek and Felix. After slaying a marauding band of beastmen, the three reach another village and warn them of the coming danger. Unfortunately, the Chaos army learns of their location and Justine leads her army in an attack on the village to find Kat. The beastmen break into the village and a vicious battle breaks out between the beasts and the villagers. Justine battles Gotrek, who injures her but cannot kill her (she was gifted with a prophecy that states no warrior can kill her in battle). Upon seeing Kat, Justine abandons her attack and pursues the girl. Realising what the Chaos Champion is after, Felix attacks her in an effort to distract her from Kat, but is swiftly overpowered. As Justine tries to break his neck, Kat intervenes and kills Justine with her own sword, thus fulfilling the prophecy and saving Felix. With their leader dead, the beastmen flee, pursued by the villagers, who slaughter them all.\n\nGotrek and Felix leave the village the day after the victory. Though Kat asks to go with them, Felix replies they cannot take her with them, as they are bound for more dangerous places where she won't be safe. Kat accepts this, and they leave, the three promising never to forget each other...\n\n===The Mutant Master===\n\nThe story begins with the pair arriving at the village of Blutdorf, on their way to Nuln. They learn the villagers are being held to ransom by a sorcerer in a nearby castle who has abducted their children: however, out of fear, the villagers drug the pair and hand them over to the sorcerer.\n\nAt the castle, the pair wake up in chains. The sorcerer reveals himself to them, and Felix recognizes him as Albericht Kruger, a fellow student from his days at the University of Altdorf, Kruger having disappeared after stealing forbidden texts on Chaos and its mutations. Kruger, now a megalomaniac egotist, arrogantly explains that he plans to use the knowledge in the texts to create an army of mutants with which to conquer the Empire.\n\nHowever, the pair break free of their captivity and fight back: when Kruger sends Oleg, the most powerful of his mutated soldiers, to kill them, Gotrek strangles the mutant with the chains he was bound with. Kruger tries to make his escape, but Gotrek and Felix pursue, cutting their way through a horde of mutants Kruger sends at them. They corner him in his study, where he explains that the mutants they had just killed were in fact the children of the villagers, Kruger having discovered children were easier to mutate than adults. In a burst of uncharacteristic fury, Felix seizes Kruger by the throat and throws him to his death from the castle battlements, an act that meets with Gotrek's approval. They set light to the castle and leave for the village, to settle a score...\n\n===Ulric's Children===\n\nThe story begins with Felix and Gotrek heading through the Drakwald Forest in heavy snow, following the tracks of a monster Gotrek believes to be a troll. The forest is unnaturally quiet, but the [[wolves]] that dwell in the forest seem unnaturally active...\n\nThe pair get separated, and Felix is captured by a group of Imperial soldiers who are actually cultists of the Chaos God [[Tzeentch]]. Felix is bound in chains next to another captive, Magdalena, a beautiful young woman the cult have captured for their dark purposes...\n\nThe pair are placed in the dungeons of the cult's leader, Count Hrothgar, and are interrogated by his lieutenant, the sorcerer Voorman. Magdalena explains to Felix the cult have abducted her to use as bait to trap her father, who is one of the 'Children of Ulric'- a [[werewolf]].\n\nFelix manages to escape his captivity and works his way through the manor, killing several of the cultists, including Count Hrothgar. He discovers that Voorman plans to perform a spell on the werewolf that will transfer his soul into its body. As he learns this, the werewolf, leading a massive pack of wolves, attacks the manor, easily defeating the cultists. In the main hall, the monster kills Voorman, but not before he completes his spell. As Voorman takes possession of the monster's body, Felix attacks him with a dagger: a dagger with a blade made of pure [[warpstone]], the only thing that will harm the beast. He manages to defeat the beast; as it dies, the wolves attacking the manor flee, as a new arrival joins the fight: Gotrek, who kept on following the tracks until he reached the manor. They capture Magdalena, and although Felix considers her an innocent in the affair, Gotrek believes that as a shapeshifter she is tainted by Chaos and kills her. Felix later states that this act still haunts him. The pair then carry on for Nuln...\n\n== Publication history ==\nIn his introduction to the 2013 edition of ''Trollslayer'', William King revealed that he wrote ''Geheimnisnacht'' as a one-off story, in [[1988 in literature|1988]], in which Gotrek was meant to die at the end, but later revised it based on his liking for the characters.  The story led to the commissioning of another by [[Games Workshop]], and then another, which led to ''Wolf Riders'' and ''The Dark Beneath the World''.\n\nThe success of these three stories led to King being commissioned to write a full-length novel, which he approached by writing three [[novella]]-length stories in episodic format, which became ''The Mark of Slaanesh'', ''Blood and Darkness'', and ''Skaven's Claw'', the last of which later formed the first chapter of the subsequent novel ''[[Skavenslayer]]''.\n\nHowever, Games Workshop Books closed unexpectedly, and the publication of the novel was delayed until [[1999 in literature|1999]], when it also included ''The Mutant Master'' and ''Ulric's Children'', which had previously been published in ''[[Inferno!]]'' magazine.  The novel also added the prefacing excerpts from Felix's journal.\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:1999 British novels]]\n[[Category:Warhammer Fantasy novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the novel by William King|information on Trollslayers in the Warhammer Fantasy fictional universe|Dwarf (Warhammer)}}\n\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2019}}\n{{Long plot|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox book| <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = Trollslayer\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| image         = Trollslayer cover.jpg <!--prefer 1st edition-->\n| caption = First edition book cover\n| author        = [[William King (author)|William King]]\n| illustrator   =\n| cover_artist  =\n| country       = United Kingdom\n| language      = English\n| series        = [[Gotrek and Felix]]\n| genre         = [[Fantasy novels]]\n| publisher     = [[Games Workshop|Black Library]]\n| pub_date      = [[1999 in literature|1999]]\n| media_type    = Print ([[Paperback]])\n| pages         = 284 pp (first edition, paperback)\n| isbn = 978-1-84154-100-6\n| isbn_note = (first edition, paperback)\n| oclc= 41832854\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   = [[Skavenslayer]]\n}}\n'''''Trollslayer''''', a novel written by [[William King (author)|William King]], is the first in a series of twelve books following the adventures of [[Gotrek and Felix]], in the [[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy universe]].

They are kicked off the coach they were riding on because of Gotrek's comments toward the coach driver and especially his wife. As they continue to travel on foot, they are nearly run down by a black coach, and Gotrek vows to find it and hurt the driver. They reach the Standing Stones Inn, and are able to make their way through the barred door to learn of how on Geheimnisnacht a coven who are based in the Darkstone Ring steal children and other people for sacrifices. They learn that the son of the innkeeper, Gunter, and his wife have both disappeared, and so they vow to find the Darkstone Ring and destroy the coven and save Gunter and his wife. After finding the path to the Ring, they come across a rotting cultist who chants gibberish before being felled. They finally come across the Ring and coven and discover that the leader of the coven is the driver of the Black Coach. They listen in for a while and learn that it is dedicated to Slaanesh, Lord of Pleasure. They finally attack and destroy the coven as they intended to sacrifice a stolen baby, and in the aftermath they discover that Gunter and his wife were both cultists, and so are both dead. They rescue the baby, and move on... This story is frequently alluded to by Felix later in the series, as it was his first true glimpse at [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]].\n\n===Wolf Riders===\n\nThe story begins with Felix in a tavern protecting a girl from the attentions of three huge trappers: Hef, Kell, and Lars. He holds his own until Gotrek comes in and drives them out. The girl introduces herself as Kirsten, and explains how her family is part of the von Diehl migration, a cursed noble family and their servants and their families moving to the Border Lands. Gotrek and Felix were on their way to the Dwarf stronghold of Karak Eight-Peaks because of stories of treasure they had heard. They decide to join the von Diehls, as they are heading in the same general direction, and they could use the cover afforded by carts. After traveling through the Grey Mountains, and reaching the Border Lands, Felix falls deeply in love with Kirsten, and she likewise. While camped in the Cursed Hills, the camp is attacked by Undead warriors, and during the fight, Felix kills the trapper Lars, after he goes crazy and attacks him. The men drive off the Undead, and they set off to find a ruined fort, which Gotrek helps repair, hinting at his pre-slayer background as an engineer. Finally, the fort is attacked by Wolf Riders, led by a Goblin Shaman, and during the first siege, Gottfried, the leader of the von Diehls, is struck by an arrow and is carried off by his son, Deiter; his nephew, Manfred; Frau Winter, a sorceress; and Kirsten, Frau Winter's assistant, to be healed. After a day of no word from them, and with the second siege starting, Felix goes off to investigate, leaving gotrek and the remaining men to fight off the horde ready to break through the gates. Felix comes across Frau Winter and Kirsten, the former who is dead and the latter who is dying. Felix watches her die, and swears to avenge her. He then comes across Dieter, whose head was bashed in, and enters Gottfired's room to see him stabbed to death in his bed with Manfred sitting there wiping off his blade. He then explains that the \"curse\" of the von Diehls was mutation brought on by a heretic cursing Manfred's grandfather. Manfred, going mad, explains that he broke the curse by killing all of the von Diehls. He and Felix duel, and Felix kills him, uttering \"The curse is broken\". He goes outside to see Gotrek standing on a pile of goblin, wolf and human bodies, including Hef and Kell. He single-handedly held the gate, killing the Shaman and losing his eye in the process. The surviving humans are taken in by one of the many Border Princes, whilst Gotrek and Felix leave, and the story ends...\n\n===The Dark Beneath the World===\n\nThe story continues immediately after 'Wolf Riders', with Felix and Gotrek travelling towards Karak Eight Peaks in search of treasure. On the way, they meet a party of men under attack from Orcs. The pair intervene and save the three survivors: Aldebrand, a zealous fanatic from the Templars of the Fiery Heart, Zauberlich, a sorcerer, and Jules, a Bretonnian scout, are also journeying to Karak Eight Peaks on a quest. The group decide to travel together. They arrive at a settlement built by the Dwarves close to the ruined city, and ask permission to enter the city, where they learn what the three men are searching for: a magical sword called Karaghul, an heirloom of the Order of the Fiery Heart, left in the city during a previous effort to reclaim part of the city by the Dwarves from the Goblins that infest it. The group are given leave to enter the city, but before they go, a Dwarven Priestess of Valaya warns them that great evil is stirring in the ruins of the city...\n\nThe group journey into the depths of the ruined city, battling with Goblins, Orcs, Skaven and Ogres that now infest the ruined halls. As they go deeper, they are followed by ghostly lights. Eventually, the lights reveal themselves as dwarven ghosts, who beg Gotrek to help them. When he asks what has happened, they say that an ancient and powerful evil has desecrated their tombs and dragged them back from their eternal rest in the Hall of Ancestors, and that unless it is slain and the tombs resanctified, they will never find their way back to eternal rest. Gotrek vows to aid them.\n\nThe group finally come to a great treasure room-the very one that Felix and Gotrek have been seeking. In pride of place is a great sword, which Aldebrand recognizes as Karaghul. However, before he can claim it, a huge creature bursts out and kills him, tearing his head from his shoulders.

The group attack, but the troll has the ability to heal its wounds almost instantaneously, and they can only slow it. The troll kills Jules and Zauberlich, but not before the sorcerer learns that fire destroys the troll's ability to regenerate. As Gotrek keeps the beast distracted, Felix throws a lamp on it, which ignites, setting the beast on fire and letting Gotrek finally kill it.\n\nA huge army of Goblins arrives, attracted by the commotion.

Gotrek ignores the treasure, realizing that to take it would desecrate the tomb and raise the ghosts again, though Felix takes Karaghul in honour of their dead comrades. Leaving the bodies of their companions at rest in the tomb, the pair seal it and leave Karak Eight Peaks behind...\n\n===The Mark of Slaanesh===\n\nThe story picks up after they have left Karak Eight Peaks and come to a small village at the edge of the Drakwald Forest. The village is controlled by a gang of vicious thugs who are also cultists of [[Slaanesh]], who viciously beat up Felix in the village tavern shortly after his arrival. To make matters worse, in a battle with mutants on the road, Gotrek was struck on the head with a slingstone and is suffering [[amnesia]], no longer remembering who he is, nor who Felix is, or his quest to find a heroic death.\n\nFelix takes Gotrek to a local healer called Kryptmann, who promises to create a brew to restore Gotrek's mind, providing Felix brings back certain ingredients from the nearby mountains.

However, the brew has no effect, and Felix attacks Kryptmann, accusing the healer of lying to him. In the confusion, Gotrek receives another blow to the head, which restores his memory to him. With the Slayer restored to his wits, the pair go to the tavern and revenge themselves on the cultists...\n\n===Blood and Darkness===\n\nThe story begins with Gotrek and Felix passing through the Drakwald Forest. They find a young girl called Kat, the sole survivor of a beastman attack on her village. The beastmen were led by a female Chaos Champion of the Chaos God, [[Khorne]], who mysteriously spared Kat's life. The story then switches to the perspective of the female Chaos Champion, a woman called Justine, who turned to Chaos after being [[raped]] as a young woman by a nobleman. After many years in the Chaos Wastes, she returns to take her revenge, destroying the nobleman's castle with her army of beastmen and murdering the nobleman. Her army has then taken to raiding nearby villages: however, she has to find and kill Kat in order to become a Daemon Prince and achieve immortality, though she has misgivings about killing the girl (it is constantly hinted, and then finally confirmed later in the story, that she is in fact Kat's mother, a pregnancy caused by her rape).\n\nThe story then returns to Gotrek and Felix.

Unfortunately, the Chaos army learns of their location and Justine leads her army in an attack on the village to find Kat. The beastmen break into the village and a vicious battle breaks out between the beasts and the villagers. Justine battles Gotrek, who injures her but cannot kill her (she was gifted with a prophecy that states no warrior can kill her in battle). Upon seeing Kat, Justine abandons her attack and pursues the girl. Realising what the Chaos Champion is after, Felix attacks her in an effort to distract her from Kat, but is swiftly overpowered. As Justine tries to break his neck, Kat intervenes and kills Justine with her own sword, thus fulfilling the prophecy and saving Felix. With their leader dead, the beastmen flee, pursued by the villagers, who slaughter them all.\n\nGotrek and Felix leave the village the day after the victory. Though Kat asks to go with them, Felix replies they cannot take her with them, as they are bound for more dangerous places where she won't be safe. Kat accepts this, and they leave, the three promising never to forget each other...\n\n===The Mutant Master===\n\nThe story begins with the pair arriving at the village of Blutdorf, on their way to Nuln. They learn the villagers are being held to ransom by a sorcerer in a nearby castle who has abducted their children: however, out of fear, the villagers drug the pair and hand them over to the sorcerer.\n\nAt the castle, the pair wake up in chains.

The forest is unnaturally quiet, but the [[wolves]] that dwell in the forest seem unnaturally active...\n\nThe pair get separated, and Felix is captured by a group of Imperial soldiers who are actually cultists of the Chaos God [[Tzeentch]].

Retrieved 2013-01-31.</ref> is a town in [[Pamlico County, North Carolina|Pamlico County]], [[North Carolina]],  United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 556. Arapahoe shares many of its roles and duties with [[Minnesott Beach, North Carolina]]. It is part of the [[New Bern, North Carolina]] [[New Bern micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n== History ==\nArapahoe was founded a few years after [[New Bern, North Carolina]] by settlers leaving the New Bern colony. This area was settled in 1703 on the old Indian trail from the big bend in the river heading west to Core Point. The community was called \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d. That Indian trail is still in use today but is now called [[North Carolina Highway 306]]. In 1886 Bob Hardison, after discussing it with his friend Bob Bowden decided to apply to the U.S. Postal Department for a Post office to be located at \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d in Pamlico County. They filled out an application and both signed it. When it was returned to them it was addressed to \u201cBob\u2019s Town\u201d, the reason being that there was already a \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d in the vicinity of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]]. Neither of the Bobs liked \u201cBob\u2019s Town\u201d so they had to come up with a different name. After a lengthy discussion Bob Hardison said \u201cWell if you have no objection, we will name it after my old white horse, Arapahoe.\u201d So it was decided and a new application filed. It was likely a year or longer before all paperwork was completed, but \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d was no more and there by named the Town of Arapahoe. [[Arapahoe]] is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe whose historic territory spanned regions of present-day Wyoming and Colorado.\n\n== Government ==\nArapahoe government is headed by the mayor of the town. Along with the mayor, there are several town commissioners, a planning board, and a volunteer fire department. The mayor and commissioners are elected to two year terms. The town hall is a small building located along the main street in Arapahoe, NC Highway 306.\n\n== Education ==\n'''Public Education'''<br>\nArapahoe has education opportunities available for children grades Kindergarten through High School. [http://www.arapahoecharter.org Arapahoe Charter School] was opened in 1997 to replace Arapahoe Elementary School. There are currently 560 students enrolled, with 40 teachers available. Arapahoe Charter School has a student:teacher ratio of 14:1.\n\nArapahoe Charter School is currently a K-12 school housed in a new $9 million facility opening for the 2018-19 school year.\n\nArapahoe is also home to the Don Lee Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donleecenter.org/ |title=Don Lee Camp & Retreat Center &#124; School Groups &#124; Summer Camp &#124; Retreats |publisher=Donleecenter.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}</ref> a Methodist founded center for camping and recreation as well as for renowned public environmental education.\n\n'''Higher Education'''<br>\nFor Higher Education, Pamlico Community College (PCC) allows for associate degrees in many areas. From PCC, one can transfer to East Carolina University to complete a bachelors and graduates degree. PCC is located only minutes from Arapahoe along NC Highway 306.\n\n==Media==\nThe Pamlico News (http://www.thepamliconews.com)\nPamlico Ink: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090209073954/http://pamlicoink.com/ The Newspaper of the Pamlico Sound]\n\n== Business ==\nArapahoe is the home of several small businesses. The largest industry in Arapahoe is agriculture. Other businesses include seafood management, home improvement, florist, food service, and other service industries. Another industry that appears to be growing in the Arapahoe area is bio-diesel production.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAnother large business located in the Arapahoe area is summer camps. Within the Arapahoe area, there are four camps: [http://www.seagull-seafarer.org/ Camp Sea Gull for boys (YMCA affiliated), Camp Seafarer for girls (YMCA affiliated)], [http://www.donleecenter.org/ Camp Don Lee (Methodist)], and [http://www.campcaroline.org/ Camp Caroline]. Most of these camps have their largest programs in the summer months, but also hold other events throughout the year. For example, Camp Seafarer and Camp Seagull offer a Spring Break camp, Mother-Daughter weekends, and Father-Son weekends among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.seagull-seafarer.org/sessions/fall-spring-sessions|title = Fall & Spring Sessions|website = Camp Sea Gull Camp Seafarer|access-date = 2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nOpportunities for businesses in Arapahoe are plentiful. Business not currently available include the hotel industry, entertainment services, gas stations/convenience stores, and several others. As stated in an article from New Bern's Sun Journal{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, the hotel business opportunities lost from Arapahoe (and subsequently relished by New Bern) can be equated to millions of dollars during the camp season due to the high proportion of camp families, events, and visitors to the recreational opportunities.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Geography==\nArapahoe is located at {{coord|35|1|33|N|76|49|44|W|type:city}} (35.025914, -76.828860).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|2.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hatteras class.jpg|left|thumb|172px|North Carolina Ferry System Hatteras Class Ferry]] -->\nArapahoe is located near the mouth of the Neuse River at the Pamlico Sound. From Arapahoe (and through Minnesott Beach), the [[North Carolina Ferry System]] has a 20-minute ferry ride from Minnesott Beach to Cherry Branch. This ferry ride leads to [[Havelock, North Carolina]], [[Atlantic Beach, North Carolina]], [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point|Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station]], and [[Beaufort, North Carolina]].\n\nA project currently under consideration is a bridge that would span the Neuse River connecting Minnesott Beach to Havelock. This project, on the state of North Carolina transportation hotspots, was recently pushed back into holding status while other projects are re-arranged to better use the new revised budget.\n\nThough not within the city limits, there are sub-regions of Arapahoe. These areas include Holt's Chapel, Kershaw, Janerio, Dawson's Creek, Taylor's Neck, and Cash Corner. [[Dawson's Creek]] area is the basis for [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]'s WB television show.\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe major means for transportation in Arapahoe is by car. There are currently no taxi service, mass transportation, or airline service within the Araphoe geographic district. The closest airport to Arapahoe is [[Craven Regional Airport]], serviced by [[American Airlines]] with eight times daily service to Charlotte.  [[Delta Connection]] has service to [[Atlanta]] with twice daily service (three times daily summer service).  Ferry service is also available from the [[North Carolina Ferry System]] with service from Minnesott Beach to Cherry Branch / [[Havelock, North Carolina|Havelock]] every 20 minutes.\n[[Image:Arapahoe TownHall.JPG|thumb|right| Arapahoe Town Hall and Fire Department]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 290\n|1940= 307\n|1950= 273\n|1960= 274\n|1970= 212\n|1980= 467\n|1990= 430\n|2000= 436\n|2010= 556\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=529\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 436 people, 188 households, and 128 families residing in the town.

This area was settled in 1703 on the old Indian trail from the big bend in the river heading west to Core Point. The community was called \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d. That Indian trail is still in use today but is now called [[North Carolina Highway 306]]. In 1886 Bob Hardison, after discussing it with his friend Bob Bowden decided to apply to the U.S. Postal Department for a Post office to be located at \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d in Pamlico County. They filled out an application and both signed it. When it was returned to them it was addressed to \u201cBob\u2019s Town\u201d, the reason being that there was already a \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d in the vicinity of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]]. Neither of the Bobs liked \u201cBob\u2019s Town\u201d so they had to come up with a different name. After a lengthy discussion Bob Hardison said \u201cWell if you have no objection, we will name it after my old white horse, Arapahoe.\u201d So it was decided and a new application filed. It was likely a year or longer before all paperwork was completed, but \u201cBethany Crossroads\u201d was no more and there by named the Town of Arapahoe. [[Arapahoe]] is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe whose historic territory spanned regions of present-day Wyoming and Colorado.\n\n== Government ==\nArapahoe government is headed by the mayor of the town. Along with the mayor, there are several town commissioners, a planning board, and a volunteer fire department. The mayor and commissioners are elected to two year terms. The town hall is a small building located along the main street in Arapahoe, NC Highway 306.\n\n== Education ==\n'''Public Education'''<br>\nArapahoe has education opportunities available for children grades Kindergarten through High School. [http://www.arapahoecharter.org Arapahoe Charter School] was opened in 1997 to replace Arapahoe Elementary School. There are currently 560 students enrolled, with 40 teachers available. Arapahoe Charter School has a student:teacher ratio of 14:1.\n\nArapahoe Charter School is currently a K-12 school housed in a new $9 million facility opening for the 2018-19 school year.\n\nArapahoe is also home to the Don Lee Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donleecenter.org/ |title=Don Lee Camp & Retreat Center &#124; School Groups &#124; Summer Camp &#124; Retreats |publisher=Donleecenter.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}</ref> a Methodist founded center for camping and recreation as well as for renowned public environmental education.\n\n'''Higher Education'''<br>\nFor Higher Education, Pamlico Community College (PCC) allows for associate degrees in many areas. From PCC, one can transfer to East Carolina University to complete a bachelors and graduates degree. PCC is located only minutes from Arapahoe along NC Highway 306.\n\n==Media==\nThe Pamlico News (http://www.thepamliconews.com)\nPamlico Ink: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090209073954/http://pamlicoink.com/ The Newspaper of the Pamlico Sound]\n\n== Business ==\nArapahoe is the home of several small businesses. The largest industry in Arapahoe is agriculture. Other businesses include seafood management, home improvement, florist, food service, and other service industries. Another industry that appears to be growing in the Arapahoe area is bio-diesel production.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAnother large business located in the Arapahoe area is summer camps. Within the Arapahoe area, there are four camps: [http://www.seagull-seafarer.org/ Camp Sea Gull for boys (YMCA affiliated), Camp Seafarer for girls (YMCA affiliated)], [http://www.donleecenter.org/ Camp Don Lee (Methodist)], and [http://www.campcaroline.org/ Camp Caroline]. Most of these camps have their largest programs in the summer months, but also hold other events throughout the year. For example, Camp Seafarer and Camp Seagull offer a Spring Break camp, Mother-Daughter weekends, and Father-Son weekends among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.seagull-seafarer.org/sessions/fall-spring-sessions|title = Fall & Spring Sessions|website = Camp Sea Gull Camp Seafarer|access-date = 2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nOpportunities for businesses in Arapahoe are plentiful. Business not currently available include the hotel industry, entertainment services, gas stations/convenience stores, and several others. As stated in an article from New Bern's Sun Journal{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, the hotel business opportunities lost from Arapahoe (and subsequently relished by New Bern) can be equated to millions of dollars during the camp season due to the high proportion of camp families, events, and visitors to the recreational opportunities.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Geography==\nArapahoe is located at {{coord|35|1|33|N|76|49|44|W|type:city}} (35.025914, -76.828860).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|2.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hatteras class.jpg|left|thumb|172px|North Carolina Ferry System Hatteras Class Ferry]] -->\nArapahoe is located near the mouth of the Neuse River at the Pamlico Sound.

This ferry ride leads to [[Havelock, North Carolina]], [[Atlantic Beach, North Carolina]], [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point|Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station]], and [[Beaufort, North Carolina]].\n\nA project currently under consideration is a bridge that would span the Neuse River connecting Minnesott Beach to Havelock. This project, on the state of North Carolina transportation hotspots, was recently pushed back into holding status while other projects are re-arranged to better use the new revised budget.\n\nThough not within the city limits, there are sub-regions of Arapahoe. These areas include Holt's Chapel, Kershaw, Janerio, Dawson's Creek, Taylor's Neck, and Cash Corner. [[Dawson's Creek]] area is the basis for [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]'s WB television show.\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe major means for transportation in Arapahoe is by car. There are currently no taxi service, mass transportation, or airline service within the Araphoe geographic district. The closest airport to Arapahoe is [[Craven Regional Airport]], serviced by [[American Airlines]] with eight times daily service to Charlotte.  [[Delta Connection]] has service to [[Atlanta]] with twice daily service (three times daily summer service).  Ferry service is also available from the [[North Carolina Ferry System]] with service from Minnesott Beach to Cherry Branch / [[Havelock, North Carolina|Havelock]] every 20 minutes.\n[[Image:Arapahoe TownHall.JPG|thumb|right| Arapahoe Town Hall and Fire Department]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 290\n|1940= 307\n|1950= 273\n|1960= 274\n|1970= 212\n|1980= 467\n|1990= 430\n|2000= 436\n|2010= 556\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=529\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 436 people, 188 households, and 128 families residing in the town.

A [[cathedral school]] (the ''[[Katedralskolan, Lund|Katedralskolan]]'') for the training of [[clergy]] was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school.\n\nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a [[Franciscan]] ''[[studium generale]]'' (a [[medieval university]]) was founded in Lund next to the [[Lund Cathedral]] (with baccalaureus degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by [[studium generale|studia generalia]] in [[Uppsala]] in 1477 and [[Copenhagen]] in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 [[Treaty of Roskilde]], the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old [[studium generale]] next to [[Lund Cathedral]].<ref name=\"A Brief History of Lund University\">[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/a-brief-history A Brief History of Lund University]</ref> The studium generale had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, which is why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, the [[Scanian lands]] came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish, and to culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named ''Academia Carolina'' after [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] until the late 19th century, when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after [[Uppsala University]] (1477), the [[University of Tartu]] (1632, now in [[Estonia]]), the [[Academy of \u00c5bo]] (1640, now in [[Finland]]), and the [[University of Greifswald]] (founded 1456; Swedish 1648\u20131815, now in [[Germany]]).\n\nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: [[faculty of law|Law]], [[Theological]], [[Medicine]] and [[Philosophy]]. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were [[Samuel Pufendorf]], a juridical historian; and [[Canutus Hahn]] and [[Kristian Papke]] in philosophy.\n\nThe [[Scanian War]] in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the [[Lund Cathedral]] and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.\n\n[[File:Historiska museet i Lund, 1800-tal.jpg|250px|thumb|right|View of the Historical Museum building in the 19th century.]]\nIn 1716, [[Charles XII of Sweden]] entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for two years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was [[Andreas Rydelius]].\n\nPeace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with [[Uppsala University]], it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.\n\nAround 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]] was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student [[C. G. Brunius]], who studied ancient languages under Tegn\u00e9r and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.\n\nIn 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted [[Nordic student meeting]]s together with the [[University of Copenhagen]].\n\nA student called [[Elsa Collin]] was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a [[Spex (theatre)|spex]].\n\n=== 20th century \u2013 present ===\n[[File:Universitetsplatsen Lund.jpg|thumb|right|The University Square in the 1910s.]]\nIn the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades it started to grow significantly, until it became one of the country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities.

[[\u00d6stg\u00f6ta Nation, Lund|\u00d6stg\u00f6ta Nation]], the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as [[student society|student societies]].\n\nToday students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.\n\nEach nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by G\u00f6teborgs Nation - called the \"Gustaf II Adolf Ball\" (also known as the \"GA-Ball\"). Most nations also host at least one [[banquet]] per week, where a three course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.\n\n=== The Academic Society ===\nIn 1830, Professor [[Carl Adolph Agardh]] formed ''Akademiska F\u00f6reningen'' (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of \"developing and cultivating the academic life\" by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. [[Oscar I of Sweden|Prince Oscar]], then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on ''[[AF-borgen]]'' (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the [[Lund University main building|Main Building]] in [[Lundag\u00e5rd (park)|Lundag\u00e5rd]]. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio ([[Radio AF]]), and organizing the enormous ''Lundakarnevalen'' (the Lund Carnival) every four years. \"AF Bost\u00e4der\", an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska F\u00f6reningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.<ref>[http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ AF Bost\u00e4der History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714071441/http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ |date=2008-07-14 }}</ref>\n\n=== Student unions ===\n[[Image:Delphi Panorama2007.jpg|thumb|The Delphi residential area, located in the northern part of Lund, is one of the large student housing complexes run by AF Bost\u00e4der.]]\nThe student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and council students regarding their rights, housing and career options.

It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as loan institute, a day-care centre and a website with housing information.

A [[cathedral school]] (the ''[[Katedralskolan, Lund|Katedralskolan]]'') for the training of [[clergy]] was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school.\n\nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a [[Franciscan]] ''[[studium generale]]'' (a [[medieval university]]) was founded in Lund next to the [[Lund Cathedral]] (with baccalaureus degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by [[studium generale|studia generalia]] in [[Uppsala]] in 1477 and [[Copenhagen]] in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 [[Treaty of Roskilde]], the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old [[studium generale]] next to [[Lund Cathedral]].<ref name=\"A Brief History of Lund University\">[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/a-brief-history A Brief History of Lund University]</ref> The studium generale had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, which is why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, the [[Scanian lands]] came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish, and to culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named ''Academia Carolina'' after [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] until the late 19th century, when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after [[Uppsala University]] (1477), the [[University of Tartu]] (1632, now in [[Estonia]]), the [[Academy of \u00c5bo]] (1640, now in [[Finland]]), and the [[University of Greifswald]] (founded 1456; Swedish 1648\u20131815, now in [[Germany]]).\n\nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: [[faculty of law|Law]], [[Theological]], [[Medicine]] and [[Philosophy]]. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were [[Samuel Pufendorf]], a juridical historian; and [[Canutus Hahn]] and [[Kristian Papke]] in philosophy.\n\nThe [[Scanian War]] in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the [[Lund Cathedral]] and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.\n\n[[File:Historiska museet i Lund, 1800-tal.jpg|250px|thumb|right|View of the Historical Museum building in the 19th century.]]\nIn 1716, [[Charles XII of Sweden]] entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for two years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was [[Andreas Rydelius]].\n\nPeace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with [[Uppsala University]], it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.\n\nAround 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]] was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student [[C. G. Brunius]], who studied ancient languages under Tegn\u00e9r and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.\n\nIn 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted [[Nordic student meeting]]s together with the [[University of Copenhagen]].\n\nA student called [[Elsa Collin]] was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a [[Spex (theatre)|spex]].\n\n=== 20th century \u2013 present ===\n[[File:Universitetsplatsen Lund.jpg|thumb|right|The University Square in the 1910s.]]\nIn the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades it started to grow significantly, until it became one of the country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. [[Lund Institute of Technology]] was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.\n\nIn recent years, Lund University has been very popular among applicants to Swedish higher education institutions, both nationally<ref>[http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/UF0513_2009A01_BR_A40BR1002.pdf Utbildning Gymnasieungdomars studieintresse l\u00e4s\u00e5ret 2009/2010]</ref> and internationally.<ref name=\"popularformasters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&news_item=5781|title=Home - Lund University|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105044724/http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&news_item=5781|archivedate=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sweden.se/study/2011/02/03/decrease-in-international-applicants-to-swedish-universities/|title=Decrease in international applicants to Swedish universities|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124150445/http://blogs.sweden.se/study/2011/02/03/decrease-in-international-applicants-to-swedish-universities/|archive-date=24 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For studies starting in autumn 2012, Lund received 11,160 foreign master's applications from 152 countries, which was roughly one third of all international applications to Swedish universities.<ref name=\"popularformasters\" />\n\n===Women at the university===\nThe first woman to study in Lund was [[Hildegard Bj\u00f6rck]] (spring of 1880) who had previously studied in [[Uppsala]] and had there been the first Swedish woman ever to get an academic degree.

Before July 1, 2010, students were required to enroll in a student union, nation and AF in order to receive grades at the university, but this is no longer compulsory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/11770/a/122528 |title=Frihet och inflytande - k\u00e5robligatoriets avskaffande |publisher=Regeringen.se |accessdate=2012-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110612212853/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/11770/a/122528 |archivedate=2011-06-12 }}</ref> Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.\n\n=== Student nations ===\n{{main|List of Lund University nations}}\nThe [[nations at Swedish universities|nations]] in Lund are a central part of the university's history, initially serving as [[residential college]]s for students, organized by geographic origin. [[\u00d6stg\u00f6ta Nation, Lund|\u00d6stg\u00f6ta Nation]], the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as [[student society|student societies]].\n\nToday students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.\n\nEach nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by G\u00f6teborgs Nation - called the \"Gustaf II Adolf Ball\" (also known as the \"GA-Ball\"). Most nations also host at least one [[banquet]] per week, where a three course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.\n\n=== The Academic Society ===\nIn 1830, Professor [[Carl Adolph Agardh]] formed ''Akademiska F\u00f6reningen'' (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of \"developing and cultivating the academic life\" by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. [[Oscar I of Sweden|Prince Oscar]], then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on ''[[AF-borgen]]'' (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the [[Lund University main building|Main Building]] in [[Lundag\u00e5rd (park)|Lundag\u00e5rd]]. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio ([[Radio AF]]), and organizing the enormous ''Lundakarnevalen'' (the Lund Carnival) every four years. \"AF Bost\u00e4der\", an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska F\u00f6reningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.<ref>[http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ AF Bost\u00e4der History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714071441/http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ |date=2008-07-14 }}</ref>\n\n=== Student unions ===\n[[Image:Delphi Panorama2007.jpg|thumb|The Delphi residential area, located in the northern part of Lund, is one of the large student housing complexes run by AF Bost\u00e4der.]]\nThe student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and council students regarding their rights, housing and career options. There are nine student unions, one for each faculty and an [https://web.archive.org/web/20191204152124/https://www.ldk.lu.se/ additional union for doctoral students]. [[Lund's Doctoral Student Union]] is further divided into councils, one for each faculty except for the faculties of engineering and fine and performing arts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120330180431/http://93.182.167.71/nya-af/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/International.Guide_.2010_Web.pdf Studentlund, International Guide 2010]</ref>\n\nThe unions are incorporated into the Association of Lund University Student Unions (LUS). It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as loan institute, a day-care centre and a website with housing information. It also publishes the monthly Lundag\u00e5rd magazine.\n\n===LINC - Lund University Finance Society===\nLINC - Lund University Finance Society, established in 1991, is the primary society for students interested in finance at Lund University. In 2019, LINC had a total of 1,800 members. LINC is the leading finance society in Sweden and one of the most prominent organizations of its kind in Northern Europe. The organization aims to provide members with a skillset to pursue a successful career in finance.<ref>http://www.linclund.com/</ref>\n\nLINC has a strong heritage, noteworthy alumni at top financial institutions, and a successful track record of organizing finance-related events including Investment Banking Forum.<ref>https://www.ehl.lu.se/nyheter/toppinternship-inom-finans-gar-arligen-till-oxford-cambridge-och-lund</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also|List of Lund University people}}\n\n[[File:Samuel von Pufendorf.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel von Pufendorf]].]]\n[[File:Tage Erlander & Bertil Ohlin 1954.jpg|thumb|[[Tage Erlander]] & [[Bertil Ohlin]] 1954.]]\n[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], SCOTUS photo portrait.]]\n[[File:1924 Karl Manne Siegbahn.jpg|right|thumb|[[Karl Manne Siegbahn]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].]]\n[[File:Swedish author Viktor rydberg with signature.jpg|thumb|Swedish author [[Viktor Rydberg]] with signature.]]\n\nAlumni and faculty of Lund University are associated with, among other things: the creation of the first implantable [[pacemaker]], the development of [[echocardiography]], the spread of modern [[physiotherapy]], the discovery of the role of [[dopamine]] as an independent neurotransmitter, the determination of the number of [[chromosomes]] of man, the establishment of [[osseointegration]], the development of the [[Bluetooth technology]], and the creation of the [[Rydberg formula]].\n\nThe following is a selected list of some notable people who have been affiliated with Lund University as students or academics.\n\n=== Humanities and economics ===\n[[Samuel Pufendorf]] (1632\u20131694) was a notable jurist and [[philosopher]] known for his natural law theories, influencing [[Adam Smith]] <ref>{{cite web | title = European Society for the History of Economic Thought | url = http://www.eshet.net/conference/paper_view.php?id=1044&p=38 | access-date = 2013-05-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130607123912/http://www.eshet.net/conference/paper_view.php?id=1044&p=38 | archive-date = 2013-06-07 | url-status = dead }}</ref> as well as [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Acton Institute |url=http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-12-number-1/samuel-von-pufendorf }}</ref> [[Olof von Dalin]] (1708\u20131763) was an influential Swedish writer and historian of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment era]].
