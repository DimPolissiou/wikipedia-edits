''Spaceship Sagittarius''}} is a 77-episode Japanese [[science fiction]] [[anime]] television series directed by [[Kazuyoshi Yokota]] and created by [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TV Asahi]]. It aired from January 10, 1986 to October 3, 1987. The series is based on comics created by Italian physicist [[Andrea Romoli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apdromolicomics.com/biographical-notes/ |title=Biographical notes |last= |first= |date= |website=Andrea Romoli comics & books |access-date=June 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Story==\nThe series depicts the adventures of four astronauts who travel through space and visit many planets. On each planet they have an adventure. Each adventure seems to have a sort of morality, such as the value of friendship or the protection of endangered species.\n\n==Setting==\n\nThe series takes place in a seemingly not so distant future. The world greatly resembles the world of the late 20th century, but there is a considerable amount of futuristic technology: interstellar travel is common place (the spatial agency which employs the characters is a modest  private agency  not related to the government), weapons which fire lasers exist, etc... But there isn't any mention of the Internet (the series was created before the internet became really common) and the characters use outdated technology such as floppy disks (instead of CDs or DVDs) to store data. At the beginning of the series the characters are mostly on Earth, but as the series progress the characters travel through space on board of their spaceship called \"The Sagittarius\". The characters visit many planets on which they have many adventures. Although the Sagittarius is an old spaceship which use a sort of oil as fuel, the spaceship is able to leave Earth and reach planets sometimes in as little time as a few hours. The characters do not require artificial respiratory systems and are able to breathe on each of the planets which they visit.\n\n==Themes==\n{{Original research section|date=June 2018}}\nThe show was full of humour but incorporated also very mature themes. Many episodes talked about subjects such as: friendship, war in general, danger of nuclear war or nuclear explosion (which is not surprising since Japan was the victim of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings), protection of the environment and of endangered species, slavery (Sebeep was the personal singer of a taxidermist in one episode), alcoholism (there was an adventure in which Toppy had become an alcoholic and abandoned his family), pirates, virtual reality (in one adventure there was a complete world which was an illusion entirely controlled by a computer),etc.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n; {{nihongo|Toppy|\u30c8\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc|Topp\u012b}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Bin Shimada]]}}\nToppy is the leader of the group. He is a young father with a wife and a baby daughter. He is usually the one who devises the strategy and tell the others what they should do. He is sometimes in conflict with Rana. In the beginning of the series he was a pilot employed by a spatial agency. The \"Sagittarius\", which is the spatial ship in which the heroes travel through space, comes from that agency.\n; {{nihongo|Rana|\u30e9\u30ca}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]]}}\nHe resembles an anthropomorphic green frog. He is married to an obese woman. He has seven children who love him dearly. When unemployed by the Sagittarius crew, he has difficulty to find a job he likes, often forced to work in bad conditions in factories, waiting for the next travel with the Sagittarius. He is the most aggressive of the group and has a short temper. He also like to flirt with women. He adores lasagna. \n; {{nihongo|Giraffe|\u30b8\u30e9\u30d5|Jirafu}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Yoku Shioya]]}}\nA giant yellow guy, he is the taller of the group. After Toppy he is the most wise member of the crew. He is a scientist and knows a lot about subjects such as chemistry, botany, among other things. He is completely in love with Professor Ann though there are not married during the most part of the show. Rana has a tendency to irritate him. Giraffe and Toppy are really the brains of the team and as such their role in the show is crucial. \n; {{nihongo|Sebeep|\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30d7|Shibippu}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Mitsuko Horie]]}}\nAn anthropomorphic plant which resembles a cactus. Seebeep was found by Toppy, Rana and Giraffe on a planet in one of their adventures and he became a member of the team. Sebeep is always happy and smiling. He is always seen with a guitar attached on his back. He likes to sing and dance. Many times during the series he takes his guitar and sing a song. The episodes in which Sebeep is the star are very emotional episodes and almost always involve singing at some point.\n; {{nihongo|Professor Ann|\u30a2\u30f3\u6559\u6388|An-ky\u014dju}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Maya Okamoto]]}}\nA scientist, Professor Ann is the most regularly seen woman in the show.

The Canadian-French co-production is a [[film adaptation]] of the [[1911 in literature|1911]] Belgian novel ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H. Rosny]]. The story is set in [[Paleolithic Europe]] (80,000 years ago), with its plot surrounding the struggle for [[control of fire by early humans]]. \n\nThe film was critically acclaimed. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair|BAFTA Award]] for Best Makeup, and the [[C\u00e9sar Award|C\u00e9sar Awards]] for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. At the [[5th Genie Awards]], the film was nominated in seven categories and won in five ([[Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Overall Sound|Best Overall Sound]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe ''Ulam'' are a tribe of [[cavemen]]<!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--> who possess fire in the form of a carefully guarded small flame which they use to start larger fires. Driven out of their home after a bloody battle with the ape-like ''Wagabu'', the ''Ulam'' are horrified when their fire is accidentally extinguished while taking refuge in a marsh. Because the tribe does not know how to create fire themselves, the tribal elder decides to send three men, Naoh, Amoukar, and Gaw, on a quest to find fire.\n\nThe trio encounter several dangers on their trek, including an encounter with the ''Kzamm'', a tribe of more primitive-looking<!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--> [[cannibals]]. The ''Kzamm'' have fire, and Naoh, Amoukar and Gaw determine to steal it. Gaw and Amoukar lure most of the ''Kzamm'' away from their encampment. Naoh kills the remaining warriors, but not before being bitten on the genitals by one, which causes him agony. The three ''Ulam'' take the ''Kzamm'' fire and prepare to head home.\n\nA young woman named Ika, who had been a captive of the ''Kzamm'', follows them. She makes a primitive [[poultice]] to help Naoh recover from his injury. Later, Amoukar attempts to rape Ika.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=Tommy Chong's Daughter, Rae Dawn, Launches a Fiery Quest for Her Own Career |journal=People |date=May 31, 1982 |url=https://people.com/archive/tommy-chongs-daughter-rae-dawn-launches-a-fiery-quest-for-her-own-career-vol-17-no-21/ |accessdate=1 December 2018 |quote=The rape scene with actor Everett McGill left her \u201cscratched, bruised and crying.

When they refuse, they go their separate ways. Naoh turns around, followed by the reluctant Gaw and Amoukar and the band is reunited. After Naoh leaves the others to scout a village, he is trapped in quicksand, nearly sinking to his death, but is discovered and captured by the Ivaka \u2014 Ika's tribe. At first, Naoh is subjected to several forms of humiliation by the Ivaka. He is forced to mate with the high-status women of the tribe, who are large and big-breasted. The petite Ika is excluded by her tribe, and when she attempts to lie near him later that night, she is chased away. The Ivaka show Naoh their advanced knowledge of [[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-making with a hand drill]].\n\nGaw and Amoukar find Naoh among the Ivaka. They try to rescue him but Naoh seems unwilling to leave. At night, Ika helps them knock Naoh unconscious and escape the camp. The next day, Naoh washes off the Ivaka body paint. He tries to mount Ika again, but she teaches him the more intimate [[missionary position]]. Not long before they reach the marsh where they started the journey, the three are beset by peer rivals from within the Ulam, who wish to steal the fire and bring it back themselves, but Naoh and his group defeat them using the Ivakan [[atlatl]]s, which are superior to Ulam weapons.\n\nFinally rejoining the Ulam, the group present the fire to the delight of all. But during the ensuing celebration, the fire is again accidentally extinguished. Naoh tries to create a new fire as he'd seen in the Ivaka camp, but after several failed attempts, Ika takes over. Once the spark is lit, the tribe is overjoyed.\n\nMonths later, Naoh and Ika prepare to have a child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Everett McGill]] as Naoh\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Amoukar\n* [[Nicholas Kadi|Nameer El-Kadi]] as Gaw\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Ika\n* Gary Schwartz as Rouka\n* Naseer El-Kadi as Nam\n* Franck-Olivier Bonnet as Aghu\n* Jean-Michel Kindt as Lakar\n* Kurt Schiegl as Faum\n* Brian Gill as Modoc\n* Terry Fitt as Hourk\n* Bibi Caspari as Gammla\n* Peter Elliott as Mikr\n* Michelle Leduc as Matr\n* Robert Lavoie as Tsor\n* Matt Birman as Morah\n* [[Joy Boushel]] as Sura\n* Christian Benard as Umbre\n* Tarlok Sing Seva as Tavawa\n* Lolamal Kapisisi as Firemaker\n* [[George Buza]] and [[The Great Antonio|Antonio Barichievich]] as ''Kzamm'' tribesmen\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and characterization===\nSpecial language forms were created by novelist [[Anthony Burgess]], while patterns of movement and gesture were developed by anthropologist [[Desmond Morris]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Quest for Fire (1981) / Quest for Accuracy |url=http://www.moviejourneys.com/quest-for-fire-1981-quest-for-accuracy/ |website=www.moviejourneys.com |accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref> The more advanced language of the Ivaka was largely that of the Cree/Inuit native people of northern Canada, which caused some amusement among those in this group who saw the film, since the words have little to do with the plot.<ref>This is according to Annaud's commentary on the DVD.

The Canadian-French co-production is a [[film adaptation]] of the [[1911 in literature|1911]] Belgian novel ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H. Rosny]]. The story is set in [[Paleolithic Europe]] (80,000 years ago), with its plot surrounding the struggle for [[control of fire by early humans]]. \n\nThe film was critically acclaimed. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair|BAFTA Award]] for Best Makeup, and the [[C\u00e9sar Award|C\u00e9sar Awards]] for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. At the [[5th Genie Awards]], the film was nominated in seven categories and won in five ([[Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Overall Sound|Best Overall Sound]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe ''Ulam'' are a tribe of [[cavemen]]<!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--> who possess fire in the form of a carefully guarded small flame which they use to start larger fires. Driven out of their home after a bloody battle with the ape-like ''Wagabu'', the ''Ulam'' are horrified when their fire is accidentally extinguished while taking refuge in a marsh. Because the tribe does not know how to create fire themselves, the tribal elder decides to send three men, Naoh, Amoukar, and Gaw, on a quest to find fire.\n\nThe trio encounter several dangers on their trek, including an encounter with the ''Kzamm'', a tribe of more primitive-looking<!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--> [[cannibals]]. The ''Kzamm'' have fire, and Naoh, Amoukar and Gaw determine to steal it. Gaw and Amoukar lure most of the ''Kzamm'' away from their encampment. Naoh kills the remaining warriors, but not before being bitten on the genitals by one, which causes him agony. The three ''Ulam'' take the ''Kzamm'' fire and prepare to head home.\n\nA young woman named Ika, who had been a captive of the ''Kzamm'', follows them. She makes a primitive [[poultice]] to help Naoh recover from his injury. Later, Amoukar attempts to rape Ika.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=Tommy Chong's Daughter, Rae Dawn, Launches a Fiery Quest for Her Own Career |journal=People |date=May 31, 1982 |url=https://people.com/archive/tommy-chongs-daughter-rae-dawn-launches-a-fiery-quest-for-her-own-career-vol-17-no-21/ |accessdate=1 December 2018 |quote=The rape scene with actor Everett McGill left her \u201cscratched, bruised and crying.

When they refuse, they go their separate ways. Naoh turns around, followed by the reluctant Gaw and Amoukar and the band is reunited. After Naoh leaves the others to scout a village, he is trapped in quicksand, nearly sinking to his death, but is discovered and captured by the Ivaka \u2014 Ika's tribe. At first, Naoh is subjected to several forms of humiliation by the Ivaka. He is forced to mate with the high-status women of the tribe, who are large and big-breasted. The petite Ika is excluded by her tribe, and when she attempts to lie near him later that night, she is chased away. The Ivaka show Naoh their advanced knowledge of [[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-making with a hand drill]].\n\nGaw and Amoukar find Naoh among the Ivaka. They try to rescue him but Naoh seems unwilling to leave. At night, Ika helps them knock Naoh unconscious and escape the camp. The next day, Naoh washes off the Ivaka body paint. He tries to mount Ika again, but she teaches him the more intimate [[missionary position]]. Not long before they reach the marsh where they started the journey, the three are beset by peer rivals from within the Ulam, who wish to steal the fire and bring it back themselves, but Naoh and his group defeat them using the Ivakan [[atlatl]]s, which are superior to Ulam weapons.\n\nFinally rejoining the Ulam, the group present the fire to the delight of all. But during the ensuing celebration, the fire is again accidentally extinguished. Naoh tries to create a new fire as he'd seen in the Ivaka camp, but after several failed attempts, Ika takes over. Once the spark is lit, the tribe is overjoyed.\n\nMonths later, Naoh and Ika prepare to have a child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Everett McGill]] as Naoh\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Amoukar\n* [[Nicholas Kadi|Nameer El-Kadi]] as Gaw\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Ika\n* Gary Schwartz as Rouka\n* Naseer El-Kadi as Nam\n* Franck-Olivier Bonnet as Aghu\n* Jean-Michel Kindt as Lakar\n* Kurt Schiegl as Faum\n* Brian Gill as Modoc\n* Terry Fitt as Hourk\n* Bibi Caspari as Gammla\n* Peter Elliott as Mikr\n* Michelle Leduc as Matr\n* Robert Lavoie as Tsor\n* Matt Birman as Morah\n* [[Joy Boushel]] as Sura\n* Christian Benard as Umbre\n* Tarlok Sing Seva as Tavawa\n* Lolamal Kapisisi as Firemaker\n* [[George Buza]] and [[The Great Antonio|Antonio Barichievich]] as ''Kzamm'' tribesmen\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and characterization===\nSpecial language forms were created by novelist [[Anthony Burgess]], while patterns of movement and gesture were developed by anthropologist [[Desmond Morris]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Quest for Fire (1981) / Quest for Accuracy |url=http://www.moviejourneys.com/quest-for-fire-1981-quest-for-accuracy/ |website=www.moviejourneys.com |accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref> The more advanced language of the Ivaka was largely that of the Cree/Inuit native people of northern Canada, which caused some amusement among those in this group who saw the film, since the words have little to do with the plot.<ref>This is according to Annaud's commentary on the DVD.

Some of the athletic playing fields along Tower Road are known as the \"Alumni Fields\" because the Cornell Alumni Association funded the grading and development of these fields in exchange for a promise that they would remain in perpetuity.  A subsequent land swap resulted in giving the Agriculture College building sites at the east end of the fields in exchange for the site of what became Schoellkopf Field and Hoy Field.<ref>[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3528/28/013_13.pdf Cornell Alumni News 1910-12-21 p. 146] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320102407/http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3528/28/013_13.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}</ref> The Alumni Fields became the site of an underground [[Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education|Synchrotron Laboratory]].<ref>[http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/public/outreach/Tours/Revised%20Web%20Page/htftour.html Retrieved 2007-09-09.]</ref> Since the 1970s, several of the fields were used as sites for new biology buildings and were replaced by new fields along Jessup Road.

There are also facilities about 2 miles east of campus that has multiple uses, but it is mainly used by the Cornell men's soccer team for practice.

Some of the athletic playing fields along Tower Road are known as the \"Alumni Fields\" because the Cornell Alumni Association funded the grading and development of these fields in exchange for a promise that they would remain in perpetuity.  A subsequent land swap resulted in giving the Agriculture College building sites at the east end of the fields in exchange for the site of what became Schoellkopf Field and Hoy Field.<ref>[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3528/28/013_13.pdf Cornell Alumni News 1910-12-21 p. 146] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320102407/http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3528/28/013_13.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}</ref> The Alumni Fields became the site of an underground [[Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education|Synchrotron Laboratory]].<ref>[http://www.lepp.cornell.edu/public/outreach/Tours/Revised%20Web%20Page/htftour.html Retrieved 2007-09-09.]</ref> Since the 1970s, several of the fields were used as sites for new biology buildings and were replaced by new fields along Jessup Road.

Around a third of Germans were Catholic in the 1930s, generally in southern Germany; Protestants dominated the north. Although the [[Catholic Church in Germany|German Catholic church]] had opposed the [[Nazi Party]], the Catholic-aligned [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] capitulated in 1933. In the 1933 elections, the percentage of Catholics voting for the Nazi Party was lower than the national average.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spenkuch |first1=Jorg |title=Elite Inuence?

Catholic press, schools, and youth organizations were closed, property was confiscated, and about one-third of its clergy faced reprisals from authorities; Catholic lay leaders were targeted during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. The [[Catholic bishops in Nazi Germany|Church hierarchy]] tried to cooperate with the new government, but Pius XI's 1937 [[encyclical]] ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' accused the government of hostility to the church. \n\nAlthough Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]]'s 1941 sermons opposed the regime, Hitler biographer [[Alan Bullock]] wrote: \"Neither the Catholic Church, nor the Evangelical Church&nbsp;... as institutions, felt it possible to take up an attitude of open opposition to the regime\".<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''. [[Harper Perennial]] edition (1991).</ref> In every country under German occupation, priests played a major role in rescuing Jews; Catholic resistance to mistreatment of Jews in Germany, however, was generally limited to fragmented, individual efforts. Mary Fulbrook wrote that when politics encroached on the church, Catholics were prepared to resist; the record was patchy and uneven, though, and (with notable exceptions) \"it seems that, for many Germans, adherence to the Christian faith proved compatible with at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship\".<ref>Fulbrook (1991), pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\nCatholics fought on both sides during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and Hitler's invasion of predominantly-Catholic Poland ignited the conflict in 1939. In the [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]], as in the annexed regions of [[Slovene Lands in World War II|Slovenia]] and Austria, [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Nazi persecution of the church]] was intense; many clergy were targeted for extermination. Through his [[Pope Pius XII and the German Resistance|links to the German Resistance]], Pope Pius XII warned the Allies of the planned Nazi invasion of the Low Countries in 1940. The Nazis gathered dissident priests that year in a dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|barracks at Dachau]], where 95 percent of its 2,720 inmates were Catholic (mostly Poles, with 411 Germans); over 1,000 priests died there. Expropriation of church properties surged after 1941. Although the Vatican (surrounded by [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]) was officially neutral during the war, it used diplomacy to aid victims and lobby for peace; [[Vatican Radio]] and other Catholic media spoke out against the atrocities. \n\nNazi antisemitism embraced pseudoscientific racial principles, but ancient antipathies between [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] contributed to European [[antisemitism]]. The church [[Rescue of Jews by Catholics during the Holocaust|rescued thousands of Jews]], however, by issuing false documents, lobbying Axis officials and hiding Jews in monasteries, convents, schools, the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and the papal residence at [[Castel Gandolfo]]. Although Pius XII's role during this period is contested, the [[Reich Main Security Office]] called him a \"mouthpiece\" of the Jews and his first encyclical (''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'') called the invasion of Poland an \"hour of darkness.\" His [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|1942 Christmas address]] denounced race murders, and his 1943 encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' denounced the murder of disabled people.<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi.html Mystici corporis Christi], 94</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nIn the 1930s, one-third of the German population was [[Religion in Nazi Germany|Catholic]]; [[Catholic Church and politics|political Catholicism]] was a major force in the interwar [[Weimar Republic]].

The Nazi Party first developed in largely-Catholic [[Munich]], however, where many Catholics provided enthusiastic support;<ref>Ericksen, 2012, pp. 47\u201349</ref> this early affinity decreased after 1923. Nazism took a different path after its [[National Socialist Program|1920 reconstitution]] and, by 1925, had an anti-Catholic identity.<ref>Derek Hastings, Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism, Oxford Press, 2011, preface.</ref> In early 1931, the German bishops excommunicated the Nazi leadership and banned Catholics from the party.

In Germany, the Catholic response to Nazism varied. [[Cesare Orsenigo]], Berlin's papal nuncio, was timid in protesting Nazi crimes and was sympathetic to [[Italian Fascism]]. German priests, including [[Alfred Delp]], were closely watched and often denounced, imprisoned or executed. In 1940, the Nazis began gathering dissident priests in a [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|dedicated barracks]] at [[Dachau concentration camp]]; ninety-five percent of its 2,720 inmates were Catholic (mostly Poles, and 411 Germans), and 1,034 died there. In [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]], the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Nazis attempted to eradicate the church]]; over 1,800 Polish clergy died in concentration camps, including [[Maximilian Kolbe]]. The [[German resistance to Nazism|German Resistance]] included the [[Kreisau Circle]] and [[20 July plot]]ers [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], [[Jakob Kaiser]] and [[Bernhard Letterhaus]].<ref>''The German Resistance to Hitler'' p. 225</ref> Resistance by Bishops [[Johannes de Jong]] and [[Jules-G\u00e9raud Sali\u00e8ge]], papal diplomat [[Angelo Rotta]], and the nun [[Margit Slachta]] contrasts with the apathy and [[collaborationism]] of [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]]'s [[Jozef Tiso]] and [[Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e|clergy Croat nationalists]]. From the Vatican, [[Hugh O'Flaherty]] coordinated the rescue of thousands of Allied [[POW]]s and civilians (including Jews). Austrian bishop [[Alois Hudal]] of the [[Collegio Teutonico]] in Rome was a Nazi informant; after the war, he and [[Krunoslav Draganovic]] of the [[Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome]] assisted the [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|ratlines]] spiriting fugitive Nazis out of Europe.\n\n=== Church background ===\nAlthough Catholicism in Germany dates back to the 6th\u20138th-century missionary work of [[Columbanus]] and [[Saint Boniface]] in the 6th\u20138th centuries, Catholics were a minority by the 20th century.

Catholic protests against the escalation of this policy into \"euthanasia\" began in the summer of 1940. Despite Nazi efforts to transfer hospitals to state control, large numbers of disabled people were still under church care. After Protestant welfare activists took a stand at the Bethel Hospital in von Galen's diocese, Galen wrote to Bertram in July 1940 urging the church to take a moral position. Bertram urged caution. Archbishop [[Conrad Gr\u00f6ber]] of Freiburg wrote to the head of the Reich Chancellery and offered to pay all costs incurred by the state for the \"care of people intended for death\". The Fulda Bishops Conference sent a protest letter to the Reich Chancellery on 11 August, and sent Bishop [[Heinrich Wienken]] of [[Caritas Internationalis]] to discuss the matter. Wienken cited the [[Thou shalt not kill|Fifth Commandment]], warning officials to halt the program or face public church protest. Although Wienken then wavered, fearing that he might jeopardise his efforts to have Catholic priests released from Dachau, he was urged to stand firm by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber. The government refused to halt the program in writing, and the Vatican declared on 2 December that the policy was contrary to natural and divine law: \"The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed\".<ref>Evans, 2008, pp.&nbsp;95\u201397</ref>\n\nArrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior was pointless. He spoke on 6, 13 and 20 July 1941 against the seizure of properties and expulsions of nuns, monks and religious, and criticized the euthanasia programme. The police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar; she escaped, and Galen made his boldest challenge to the government in a 3 August sermon. He formally accused those responsible for the murders in a letter to the public prosecutor. The policy opened the way to the murder of all \"unproductive people\", including invalid war veterans; \"Who can trust his doctor anymore?\".<ref>Evans, 2008, pp.&nbsp;97\u201398</ref> Galen said that it was a Christian duty to oppose the taking of human life, even if it risked one's own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-9342909 |title=Encyclop\u0107dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |work=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> He addressed a moral danger to Germany from the government's violations of human rights.<ref name=\"Hamerow, 1997, pp. 289-90\"/> \"The sensation created by the sermons was enormous\",<ref>Evans, 2008, p. 98</ref> and they were a \"vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism\".<ref name=\"Ian Kershaw pp210-11\"/> wrote: \"Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state\".<ref name=\"Honourable Defeat p.60\"/> The sermons were distributed illegally,<ref name=\"Honourable Defeat p.60\">Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.60</ref> and Galen had them read in churches.

Within days of Pius' death in 1958, Vatican officials asked Draganovic to leave the college.<ref>Ventresca, 2013, p. 259</ref> Until then, however, Draganovic \"was a law unto himself and ran his own show\". In 1948, he brought Nazi collaborator and wanted war criminal [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] to the [[Pontifical Latin American College]] disguised as a priest until Argentine President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] invited him to his country.<ref>Hebblethwaite, 1993, pp.&nbsp;209\u201310</ref>\n\n== <span id=\"Post-war attitudes to Nazi Germany\"></span>Post-war attitudes ==\nSince the end of World War II, the church has honoured Catholic resistors and victims of Nazism and issued statements of [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] for its failings and those of its members during the Nazi era. Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pius XII|elevated a number]] of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946. Among them were Bishop [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne, who succeeded Cardinal Bertram as chairman of the Fulda Bishops' Conference in July 1945;<ref name=\"gdw-berlin.de\"/> [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] of M\u00fcnster, and [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin. Pius also selected  resistors in other countries: Dutch Archbishop [[Johannes de Jong]]; Hungarian Bishop [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]; Polish Archbishop [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]]; and French Archbishop [[Jules-G\u00e9raud Sali\u00e8ge]]. Italian papal diplomat Angelo Roncalli (later [[Pope John XXIII]]) and Polish Archbishop [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] were elevated in 1953.\n\nOf the post-war popes, John XXIII and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] were actively involved in the protection of Jews during the war. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (Joseph Ratzinger) grew up in [[Nazi Germany]]. Enrolled in the [[Hitler Youth]] at 14, he was drafted as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]] two years later.

Around a third of Germans were Catholic in the 1930s, generally in southern Germany; Protestants dominated the north. Although the [[Catholic Church in Germany|German Catholic church]] had opposed the [[Nazi Party]], the Catholic-aligned [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] capitulated in 1933. In the 1933 elections, the percentage of Catholics voting for the Nazi Party was lower than the national average.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spenkuch |first1=Jorg |title=Elite Inuence?

Catholic press, schools, and youth organizations were closed, property was confiscated, and about one-third of its clergy faced reprisals from authorities; Catholic lay leaders were targeted during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. The [[Catholic bishops in Nazi Germany|Church hierarchy]] tried to cooperate with the new government, but Pius XI's 1937 [[encyclical]] ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' accused the government of hostility to the church. \n\nAlthough Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]]'s 1941 sermons opposed the regime, Hitler biographer [[Alan Bullock]] wrote: \"Neither the Catholic Church, nor the Evangelical Church&nbsp;... as institutions, felt it possible to take up an attitude of open opposition to the regime\".<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''. [[Harper Perennial]] edition (1991).</ref> In every country under German occupation, priests played a major role in rescuing Jews; Catholic resistance to mistreatment of Jews in Germany, however, was generally limited to fragmented, individual efforts. Mary Fulbrook wrote that when politics encroached on the church, Catholics were prepared to resist; the record was patchy and uneven, though, and (with notable exceptions) \"it seems that, for many Germans, adherence to the Christian faith proved compatible with at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship\".<ref>Fulbrook (1991), pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\nCatholics fought on both sides during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and Hitler's invasion of predominantly-Catholic Poland ignited the conflict in 1939. In the [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]], as in the annexed regions of [[Slovene Lands in World War II|Slovenia]] and Austria, [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Nazi persecution of the church]] was intense; many clergy were targeted for extermination. Through his [[Pope Pius XII and the German Resistance|links to the German Resistance]], Pope Pius XII warned the Allies of the planned Nazi invasion of the Low Countries in 1940. The Nazis gathered dissident priests that year in a dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|barracks at Dachau]], where 95 percent of its 2,720 inmates were Catholic (mostly Poles, with 411 Germans); over 1,000 priests died there. Expropriation of church properties surged after 1941. Although the Vatican (surrounded by [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]) was officially neutral during the war, it used diplomacy to aid victims and lobby for peace; [[Vatican Radio]] and other Catholic media spoke out against the atrocities. \n\nNazi antisemitism embraced pseudoscientific racial principles, but ancient antipathies between [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] contributed to European [[antisemitism]]. The church [[Rescue of Jews by Catholics during the Holocaust|rescued thousands of Jews]], however, by issuing false documents, lobbying Axis officials and hiding Jews in monasteries, convents, schools, the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and the papal residence at [[Castel Gandolfo]]. Although Pius XII's role during this period is contested, the [[Reich Main Security Office]] called him a \"mouthpiece\" of the Jews and his first encyclical (''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'') called the invasion of Poland an \"hour of darkness.\" His [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|1942 Christmas address]] denounced race murders, and his 1943 encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' denounced the murder of disabled people.<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi.html Mystici corporis Christi], 94</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nIn the 1930s, one-third of the German population was [[Religion in Nazi Germany|Catholic]]; [[Catholic Church and politics|political Catholicism]] was a major force in the interwar [[Weimar Republic]]. Catholic leaders denounced Nazi doctrine before 1933, and Catholic regions generally did not vote Nazi. The Nazi Party first developed in largely-Catholic [[Munich]], however, where many Catholics provided enthusiastic support;<ref>Ericksen, 2012, pp. 47\u201349</ref> this early affinity decreased after 1923.

In Germany, the Catholic response to Nazism varied. [[Cesare Orsenigo]], Berlin's papal nuncio, was timid in protesting Nazi crimes and was sympathetic to [[Italian Fascism]]. German priests, including [[Alfred Delp]], were closely watched and often denounced, imprisoned or executed. In 1940, the Nazis began gathering dissident priests in a [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|dedicated barracks]] at [[Dachau concentration camp]]; ninety-five percent of its 2,720 inmates were Catholic (mostly Poles, and 411 Germans), and 1,034 died there. In [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]], the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Nazis attempted to eradicate the church]]; over 1,800 Polish clergy died in concentration camps, including [[Maximilian Kolbe]].

In August 1936, the German bishops met for their annual conference in [[Fulda]]. They produced a joint pastoral letter about the Spanish Civil War: \"Therefore, German unity should not be sacrificed to religious antagonism, quarrels, contempt, and struggles.

Catholic protests against the escalation of this policy into \"euthanasia\" began in the summer of 1940. Despite Nazi efforts to transfer hospitals to state control, large numbers of disabled people were still under church care. After Protestant welfare activists took a stand at the Bethel Hospital in von Galen's diocese, Galen wrote to Bertram in July 1940 urging the church to take a moral position. Bertram urged caution. Archbishop [[Conrad Gr\u00f6ber]] of Freiburg wrote to the head of the Reich Chancellery and offered to pay all costs incurred by the state for the \"care of people intended for death\". The Fulda Bishops Conference sent a protest letter to the Reich Chancellery on 11 August, and sent Bishop [[Heinrich Wienken]] of [[Caritas Internationalis]] to discuss the matter. Wienken cited the [[Thou shalt not kill|Fifth Commandment]], warning officials to halt the program or face public church protest. Although Wienken then wavered, fearing that he might jeopardise his efforts to have Catholic priests released from Dachau, he was urged to stand firm by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber. The government refused to halt the program in writing, and the Vatican declared on 2 December that the policy was contrary to natural and divine law: \"The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed\".<ref>Evans, 2008, pp.&nbsp;95\u201397</ref>\n\nArrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior was pointless. He spoke on 6, 13 and 20 July 1941 against the seizure of properties and expulsions of nuns, monks and religious, and criticized the euthanasia programme. The police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar; she escaped, and Galen made his boldest challenge to the government in a 3 August sermon. He formally accused those responsible for the murders in a letter to the public prosecutor. The policy opened the way to the murder of all \"unproductive people\", including invalid war veterans; \"Who can trust his doctor anymore?\".<ref>Evans, 2008, pp.&nbsp;97\u201398</ref> Galen said that it was a Christian duty to oppose the taking of human life, even if it risked one's own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-9342909 |title=Encyclop\u0107dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |work=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> He addressed a moral danger to Germany from the government's violations of human rights.<ref name=\"Hamerow, 1997, pp. 289-90\"/> \"The sensation created by the sermons was enormous\",<ref>Evans, 2008, p. 98</ref> and they were a \"vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism\".<ref name=\"Ian Kershaw pp210-11\"/> wrote: \"Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state\".<ref name=\"Honourable Defeat p.60\"/> The sermons were distributed illegally,<ref name=\"Honourable Defeat p.60\">Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.60</ref> and Galen had them read in churches.

It owns 46,1% of [[TAV Airports Holding]], and 8% of the [[Schiphol Group]]. Since 2012, the CEO is [[Augustin de Romanet de Beaune|Augustin de Romanet]].

In 1946, the first provisional terminal at [[Orly Airport]] was achieved, as well as the reconstruction of [[Paris\u2013Le Bourget Airport]]. In the 1950s, Orly Airport outgrew Le Bourget's traffic, and became the leading Parisian airport, breaking the 1 million passengers/year milestone. Le Bourget launched the first edition of the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1953 and switched to business jet operations in 1976.\n\nIn 1957, L\u2019a\u00e9roport de Paris started to look for a land to build a new Parisian airport. Construction of the airport started in 1966 and [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] officially started its operations in March 1974.

In 1946, the first provisional terminal at [[Orly Airport]] was achieved, as well as the reconstruction of [[Paris\u2013Le Bourget Airport]]. In the 1950s, Orly Airport outgrew Le Bourget's traffic, and became the leading Parisian airport, breaking the 1 million passengers/year milestone. Le Bourget launched the first edition of the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1953 and switched to business jet operations in 1976.\n\nIn 1957, L\u2019a\u00e9roport de Paris started to look for a land to build a new Parisian airport. Construction of the airport started in 1966 and [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] officially started its operations in March 1974. In 1976, 20 million passengers flew through the Parisian airports.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, L\u2019a\u00e9roport de Paris, which became ''A\u00e9roports de Paris'' in 1989 and ''Paris A\u00e9roport'' in 2016, built new satellites and terminals for the Charles de Gaulle airport (terminal 2, terminal 3). By 1987, traffic in the Parisian airports grew to 40 million. A [[TGV]] train station opened within the Charles de Gaulle airport in 1994.\n\n=== Privatization and modernization of airports ===\nA\u00e9roports de Paris became a [[public company]] on 20 April 2005, although the French government retained a majority of the company's shares.

In Equatorial Guinea, they became part of the ''[[Emancipados]]''; in Nigeria, they were called ''[[Saros (Nigeria)#Amaros|Amaros]]''.  Despite being free to return to [[Cuba]] when their tenure was over, they remained in these countries marrying into the local indigenous population. The former slaves were brought to Africa by the ''Royal Orders of September 13, 1845'' (by way of voluntary arrangement) and a June 20, 1861, deportation from Cuba, due to the lack of volunteers. Similar circumstances previously occurred during the 17th century where ex-slaves from both [[Cuba]] and Brazil were offered the same opportunity.\n\n[[Angola]] also has communities of Afro-Cubans, Amparos. They are descendants of Afro-Cuban soldiers brought to the country in 1975 as a result of the Cuban involvement in the [[Cold War]]. [[Fidel Castro]] deployed thousands of troops to the country during the [[Angolan Civil War]]. As a result of this era, there exists a small Spanish-speaking community in [[Angola]] of Afro-Cubans numbering about 100,000.\n\n===Haitian-Cubans===\n{{Main|Haitian Cuban}}\n[[Haitian Creole]] and culture first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791\u20131804 [[Haitian Revolution]] brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially [[Guant\u00e1namo]], where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in [[Baracoa]] and [[Mais\u00ed]], the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Later, Haitians continued to come to Cuba to work as braceros (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning \"arm\") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians suffered discrimination. \nAfter Spanish, Creole is the second most-spoken language in Cuba.  In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in [[Ciego de \u00c1vila]] and [[Camag\u00fcey]] provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana. There is a Creole-language radio program.\n\n==Religion==\n[[Image:Santeria.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Santer\u00eda]] icons at an open place of worship in [[Havana]]. Santer\u00eda is a [[syncretism]] practiced by many Afro-Cubans]]\nAfro-Cuban religion can be broken down into three main currents: [[Santer\u00eda]], [[Palo Monte]] and [[Abaku\u00e1]] and include individuals of all origins. Santer\u00eda is syncretized with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].\n\nThe Abaku\u00e1 religion is a secret society for men, similar to the freemason orders of Europe. It has not been syncretized with Roman Catholicism and remains close to its origins in southeastern [[Nigeria]] and southwestern [[Cameroon]], from the [[Ekpe]] society of the [[Efik people]] of [[Cross River State]] and nearby areas.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Music of African heritage in Cuba|Music of Cuba#African heritage}}\nAfro-Cuban music involves two main categories of music, religious and profane. Religious music includes the chants, [[bat\u00e1|rhythms]] and [[claves|instruments]] used in rituals of the above-mentioned religious currents, while profane music focuses largely on [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], [[guaguanc\u00f3]] and [[comparsa]] (carnival music) as well as several lesser styles such as the [[tumba francesa]]. Virtually all [[Music of Cuba|Cuban music]] has been influenced by African rhythms. Cuban popular music, and quite a lot of the art music, has strands from both Spain and Africa, woven into a unique Cuban cloth. The ''[[Son (music)|son]]'' is a typical example of this. While much of the music is often performed in cut-time, artists typically use an array of time signatures like 6/8 for drumming beats. [[Clave (rhythm)|Clave]], on the other hand, uses a polymetric 7/8 + 5/8 time signature <ref>King, Anthony (1961:14). ''Yoruba Sacred Music from Ekiti''. Ibadan University Press.</ref>\n\n==Language==\nOther cultural elements considered to be Afro-Cuban can be found in language (including syntax, vocabulary, and style of speech).\n\nThe Afro-Cuban religions all maintain some degree of use of African languages. [[Santer\u00eda]] and [[Abaku\u00e1]] both have large parts of their liturgy in African languages ([[Lucum\u00ed language|Lucum\u00ed]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and \u00d1a\u00f1igo, respectively) while [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] uses a mixture of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Kikongo]], known as [[Habla Congo]].\n\n==Racial consciousness==\n{{main|Racism in Cuba}}\nAccording to anthropologists dispatched by the [[European Union]], racism is entrenched in Cuba.<ref name=\"obamaeffect\"/> Afro-Cubans are systematically excluded from positions in tourism-related jobs, where they could earn tips in hard currencies.<ref name=\"obamaeffect\"/> According to the EU study, Afro-Cubans are relegated to poor housing, and African Cubans are excluded from managerial positions.<ref name=\"obamaeffect\">{{cite web|date=December 15, 2008 |publisher=New America Media |title=\u2018Obama Effect\u2019 Highlights Racism in Cuba |url=http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=7b4ef8e52790034e043a37d170243f0f }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nEnrique Patterson describes race as a \"social bomb\" and says that \"If the Cuban government were to permit Afro-Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities] ... totalitarianism would fall\".<ref name=\"barrier\"/> Esteban Morales Dom\u00ednguez, a professor at the University of Havana, says that \"The absence of the debate on the racial problem already threatens ... the revolution's social project\".<ref name=\"barrier\"/> [[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], who has written extensively on the issue, says that \"There is an unstated threat, Afro-cubans in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail.

It achieved significant gains in racial equality through a series of egalitarian reforms early in the 1960s. [[Fidel Castro]]'s first public address on racism after his rise to power was on March 23, 1959, at a labor rally in Havana, less than three months after he defeated [[Fulgencio Batista]]. He is quoted as saying: \"One of the most just battles that must be fought, a battle that must be emphasized more and more, which I might call the fourth battle--the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. I repeat: the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. Of all the forms of racial discrimination the worst is the one that limits the colored Cuban's access to jobs. \"<ref>Speech at Havana Labor Rally . Transcript available on [http://www1.lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1959/19590323.html The University of Texas at Austin - Web Central]</ref> Castro pointed to the distinction between social segregation and employment, while placing great emphasis on correcting the latter. In response to the large amount of racism that existed in the job market, Castro issued anti-discrimination laws. In addition, he attempted to close the class gap between wealthy white Cubans and Afro-Cubans with a massive literacy campaign among other egalitarian reforms in the early and mid-1960s.<ref>Perez, Louis A. ''Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution'', New York. 2006, p. 326.</ref>\nTwo years after his 1959 speech at the Havana Labor Rally, Castro declared that the age of racism and discrimination was over. In a speech given at the [[Workers' Central Union of Cuba|Confederation of Cuban Workers]] in observance of [[International Workers' Day|May Day]], Castro declared that the \"just laws of the revolution ended unemployment, put an end to villages without hospitals and schools, enacted laws which ended discrimination, control by monopolies, humiliation, and the suffering of the people.\"<ref>Speech given by Fidel Castro on April 8, 1961.

Evidence collected in 2003 over proved.</ref>\n\nResearch conducted by Yesilernis Pe\u00f1a, [[Jim Sidanius]] and Mark Sawyer in 2003, suggests that social discrimination is still prevalent, despite the low levels of economic discrimination.<ref>Pena, Y., Jim Sidanis and Mark Sawyer. 2003. ''Racial Democracy in the Americas: A Latin and US Comparison''. [[University of California]], Los Angeles.</ref>\nAfter considering the issue solved, the Cuban government moved beyond the issue of racism.  His message marked a shift in Cuban society's perception of racism that was triggered by the change in government focus.\"<ref name=\"Moore, C 1995\"/>  The government's announcement easily allowed the Cuban public to deny discrimination without first correcting the stereotypes that remained in the minds of those who grew up in a Cuba that was racially and economically divided. Many who argue that racism does not exist in Cuba base their claims on the idea of Latin American [[Exceptionalism]]. According to the argument of Latin American Exceptionality, a social history of intermarriage and mixing of the races is unique to Latina America. The large [[mestizo]] populations that result from high levels of interracial union common to Latin America are often linked to [[racial democracy]]. For many Cubans this translates into an argument of \"racial harmony\", often referred to as racial democracy. In the case of Cuba, ideas of Latin American Exceptionalism have delayed the progress of true racial harmony.<ref>Mark Sawyer. ''Racial Politics in Post- Revolutionary Cuba''.</ref>\n\nMost of the Latin population of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] in the 1950s was working class and lived in restricted areas, ethnic enclaves in the vicinity of Tampa's hundreds of cigar factories. African Cubans were tolerated to an extent in the Latin quarter (where most neighborhoods and cigar factories were integrated). [[Ybor City]] and its counterpart, [[West Tampa]], were areas that bordered on other restricted sections-areas for U.S. blacks or whites only. In this Latin quarter, there existed racial discrimination despite its subtleness.<ref>''Black Cuban, Black American''. Houston, Texas: Arte Publico Press, 130. Print.</ref>\n\n==Afrocubanismo==\n{{Main|Afrocubanismo}}\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s Cuba experienced a movement geared towards Afro-Cuban culture called Afrocubanismo.<ref>Arnedo-G\u00f3mez, M. \"Introduction.\" ''Writing Rumba''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2006: 1.</ref> The movement had a large impact on [[Cuban literature]], poetry, painting, music, and sculpture.  It was the first artistic campaign in [[Cuba]] that focused on one particular theme: African culture.  Specifically it highlighted the struggle for independence from Spain, African [[slavery]], and building a purely Cuban national identity.  Its goal was to incorporate African [[folklore]] and [[rhythm]] into traditional modes of art.\n\n===History of the movement===\nThe movement evolved from an interest in the rediscovery of African heritage.  It developed in two very different and parallel stages.  One stage stemmed from European artists and intellectuals who were interested in African art and musical folk forms.<ref>\"Afrocubanismo\", ''Encyclopedia of World Literature in the 20th Century''. Ed. Lenard S Klein. Continuum: Continuum Publishing Company, 2008: 20.</ref> This stage paralleled the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in New York, [[N\u00e9gritude]] in the [[French Caribbean]], and coincided with stylistic European Vanguard (like Cubism and its representation of African masks).  It was characterized by the participation of white intellectuals such as Cubans [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[R\u00f3mulo Lachata\u00f1er\u00e9]], [[Fortunato Vizcarrondo]], [[Fernando Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez|Fernando Ortiz]] and [[Lydia Cabrera]], Puerto Rican [[Luis Pal\u00e9s Matos]] and Spaniards [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Roger de Lauria]].  The African-inspired art tended to represent Afro-Cubans with clich\u00e9 images such as a black man sitting beneath a palm tree with a cigar.\n\nPoems and essays by Afro-Cuban writers began to be published in the 1930s in newspapers, magazines and books, where they discussed their own personal heritage.  Afro-Cuban and Afro-Cuban heritage artists such as Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n, Alberto Arredondo and Emilio Ballagas brought light to the once-marginalized African race and culture.  It became a symbol of empowerment and individuality for Afro-Cubans within the established Western culture of the Americas and Europe.<ref>Moore, R. \"The Minorista Vanguard: Modernism and Afrocubanismo.\" ''Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920-1940''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1997:200.</ref>\n\nThis empowerment became a catalyst for the second stage to be characterized by Afro-Cuban artists making art that truly reflected what it meant to be Afro-Cuban. Beginning in the 1930s this stage depicted a more serious view of black culture like African religions and the struggles associated with slavery.  The main [[protagonist]] during this stage of the movement was [[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]].<ref>Henken, T. \"Cuban Literature-The Avant-Garde vs the Vanguard: Colonial Literature\", in ''Cuba: A Global Studies Handbook''. Santa Barbara: ABC_CLIO, 2008: 363.</ref>\n\n===Results of the movement===\nThe lasting reputation of the Afrocubanismo movement was the establishment of a [[New World]] art form that used aesthetics from both European and African culture.<ref>\"Literature of the Revolutionary Era\", ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, history, culture''. Ed. Luis Martinez Ternandez. Wesport: Greenwood Press, 2003: 345.</ref> Although the actual movement of Afrocubanismo faded by the early 1940s, Afro-Cuban culture continues to play a vital role in the identity of Cuba.  It has been the [[Cuban Revolution]] that opened up a space for extended research of African ethnic roots in Cuba.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Mangual, E. \"Introduction\", ''Lydia Cabrera and the Construction of an Afro-Cuban Cultural Identity''. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004: 17.</ref> The rhetoric of the Revolution incorporates black history and its contribution as an important [[stratum]] of Cuban identity.  The Revolution has funded many projects that restore the work of Afro-Cubans in an effort to accommodate an African-driven identity within the new anti-racist Cuban society.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez-Mangual, E. \"Introduction\", 18.</ref>\n\n==Notable Afro-Cubans==\n\n===Arts and entertainment===\n*[[Alberto Arredondo]] - journalist, essayist, narrator, speaker and economist\n*[[Alberto Abreu Arcia]] - narrator and essayist\n*[[Alfredo Mor\u00faa Averhoff]] - musician, bread artisan and pastry chef\n*[[Amir Randall]] - actor, comedian, genius\n*[[Renny Arozarena]] - actor\n*[[Gast\u00f3n Baquero]] - poet\n*[[Matt Cede\u00f1o]] - actor and model\n*[[Celia Cruz]] - singer\n*[[Mellow Man Ace]] - rapper\n*[[Rosario Dawson]] - actress\n*[[\u00c1ngel Escobar]] - poet\n*[[Lola Falana]] - actress, singer and dancer\n*[[Sara G\u00f3mez]] - filmmaker \n*[[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]] - poet\n*[[Ignacio Granados]] - poet\n*[[Nestor Hern\u00e1ndez]] - photographer\n*[[Georgina Herrera]] - poet\n*[[Wifredo Lam]] - artist\n*[[Coco L\u00f3pez]] - artist \n*[[Faizon Love]] - actor \n*[[Nancy Morej\u00f3n]] - poet\n*[[Luis Moro]] - actor and filmmaker\n*[[Pierre O\u2019Farrell]] - actor\n*[[Rafael Serra]] - writer and political journalist \n*[[Gina Torres]] - actress\n*[[Alexis Vald\u00e9s]] - artist and comedian\nLazaro Alonso - actor\n\n\n*[[Martin Mor\u00faa Delgado]] - orator\n*[[Jorge Luis Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez]] - human rights activist\n\n===Music===\n*[[Afro-Cuban All Stars]]\n*[[Francisco Aguabella]] \u2014 percussionist\n*[[Tata G\u00fcines|Federico A. \"Tata G\u00fcines\" Soto Alejo]] \u2014 percussionist and bandleader\n*[[Carlos Alfonso]] \u2014 bassist and leader of S\u00edntesis\n*[[X Alfonso]] \u2014 singer\n*[[Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros]] \u2014 trumpeter and bandleader\n*[[Guillermo Barreto]] \u2014 percussionist \n*[[Abelardo Barroso]] \u2014 singer and bandleader \n*[[Mario Bauz\u00e1]] \u2014 musician and songwriter;

In Equatorial Guinea, they became part of the ''[[Emancipados]]''; in Nigeria, they were called ''[[Saros (Nigeria)#Amaros|Amaros]]''.  Despite being free to return to [[Cuba]] when their tenure was over, they remained in these countries marrying into the local indigenous population. The former slaves were brought to Africa by the ''Royal Orders of September 13, 1845'' (by way of voluntary arrangement) and a June 20, 1861, deportation from Cuba, due to the lack of volunteers. Similar circumstances previously occurred during the 17th century where ex-slaves from both [[Cuba]] and Brazil were offered the same opportunity.\n\n[[Angola]] also has communities of Afro-Cubans, Amparos. They are descendants of Afro-Cuban soldiers brought to the country in 1975 as a result of the Cuban involvement in the [[Cold War]]. [[Fidel Castro]] deployed thousands of troops to the country during the [[Angolan Civil War]]. As a result of this era, there exists a small Spanish-speaking community in [[Angola]] of Afro-Cubans numbering about 100,000.\n\n===Haitian-Cubans===\n{{Main|Haitian Cuban}}\n[[Haitian Creole]] and culture first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791\u20131804 [[Haitian Revolution]] brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially [[Guant\u00e1namo]], where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in [[Baracoa]] and [[Mais\u00ed]], the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Later, Haitians continued to come to Cuba to work as braceros (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning \"arm\") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians suffered discrimination. \nAfter Spanish, Creole is the second most-spoken language in Cuba.  In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in [[Ciego de \u00c1vila]] and [[Camag\u00fcey]] provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana. There is a Creole-language radio program.\n\n==Religion==\n[[Image:Santeria.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Santer\u00eda]] icons at an open place of worship in [[Havana]]. Santer\u00eda is a [[syncretism]] practiced by many Afro-Cubans]]\nAfro-Cuban religion can be broken down into three main currents: [[Santer\u00eda]], [[Palo Monte]] and [[Abaku\u00e1]] and include individuals of all origins. Santer\u00eda is syncretized with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].\n\nThe Abaku\u00e1 religion is a secret society for men, similar to the freemason orders of Europe. It has not been syncretized with Roman Catholicism and remains close to its origins in southeastern [[Nigeria]] and southwestern [[Cameroon]], from the [[Ekpe]] society of the [[Efik people]] of [[Cross River State]] and nearby areas.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Music of African heritage in Cuba|Music of Cuba#African heritage}}\nAfro-Cuban music involves two main categories of music, religious and profane. Religious music includes the chants, [[bat\u00e1|rhythms]] and [[claves|instruments]] used in rituals of the above-mentioned religious currents, while profane music focuses largely on [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], [[guaguanc\u00f3]] and [[comparsa]] (carnival music) as well as several lesser styles such as the [[tumba francesa]]. Virtually all [[Music of Cuba|Cuban music]] has been influenced by African rhythms. Cuban popular music, and quite a lot of the art music, has strands from both Spain and Africa, woven into a unique Cuban cloth. The ''[[Son (music)|son]]'' is a typical example of this. While much of the music is often performed in cut-time, artists typically use an array of time signatures like 6/8 for drumming beats. [[Clave (rhythm)|Clave]], on the other hand, uses a polymetric 7/8 + 5/8 time signature <ref>King, Anthony (1961:14). ''Yoruba Sacred Music from Ekiti''. Ibadan University Press.</ref>\n\n==Language==\nOther cultural elements considered to be Afro-Cuban can be found in language (including syntax, vocabulary, and style of speech).\n\nThe Afro-Cuban religions all maintain some degree of use of African languages. [[Santer\u00eda]] and [[Abaku\u00e1]] both have large parts of their liturgy in African languages ([[Lucum\u00ed language|Lucum\u00ed]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and \u00d1a\u00f1igo, respectively) while [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] uses a mixture of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Kikongo]], known as [[Habla Congo]].\n\n==Racial consciousness==\n{{main|Racism in Cuba}}\nAccording to anthropologists dispatched by the [[European Union]], racism is entrenched in Cuba.<ref name=\"obamaeffect\"/> Afro-Cubans are systematically excluded from positions in tourism-related jobs, where they could earn tips in hard currencies.<ref name=\"obamaeffect\"/> According to the EU study, Afro-Cubans are relegated to poor housing, and African Cubans are excluded from managerial positions.<ref name=\"obamaeffect\">{{cite web|date=December 15, 2008 |publisher=New America Media |title=\u2018Obama Effect\u2019 Highlights Racism in Cuba |url=http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=7b4ef8e52790034e043a37d170243f0f }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nEnrique Patterson describes race as a \"social bomb\" and says that \"If the Cuban government were to permit Afro-Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities] ... totalitarianism would fall\".<ref name=\"barrier\"/> Esteban Morales Dom\u00ednguez, a professor at the University of Havana, says that \"The absence of the debate on the racial problem already threatens ... the revolution's social project\".<ref name=\"barrier\"/> [[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], who has written extensively on the issue, says that \"There is an unstated threat, Afro-cubans in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail.

It achieved significant gains in racial equality through a series of egalitarian reforms early in the 1960s. [[Fidel Castro]]'s first public address on racism after his rise to power was on March 23, 1959, at a labor rally in Havana, less than three months after he defeated [[Fulgencio Batista]]. He is quoted as saying: \"One of the most just battles that must be fought, a battle that must be emphasized more and more, which I might call the fourth battle--the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. I repeat: the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. Of all the forms of racial discrimination the worst is the one that limits the colored Cuban's access to jobs. \"<ref>Speech at Havana Labor Rally . Transcript available on [http://www1.lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1959/19590323.html The University of Texas at Austin - Web Central]</ref> Castro pointed to the distinction between social segregation and employment, while placing great emphasis on correcting the latter. In response to the large amount of racism that existed in the job market, Castro issued anti-discrimination laws. In addition, he attempted to close the class gap between wealthy white Cubans and Afro-Cubans with a massive literacy campaign among other egalitarian reforms in the early and mid-1960s.<ref>Perez, Louis A. ''Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution'', New York. 2006, p. 326.</ref>\nTwo years after his 1959 speech at the Havana Labor Rally, Castro declared that the age of racism and discrimination was over. In a speech given at the [[Workers' Central Union of Cuba|Confederation of Cuban Workers]] in observance of [[International Workers' Day|May Day]], Castro declared that the \"just laws of the revolution ended unemployment, put an end to villages without hospitals and schools, enacted laws which ended discrimination, control by monopolies, humiliation, and the suffering of the people.\"<ref>Speech given by Fidel Castro on April 8, 1961.  Text provided by Havana FIEL Network.</ref> Although inspiring, many would consider the claim to be premature.\"<ref name=\"Moore, C 1995\">Moore, C. 1995.

Evidence collected in 2003 over proved.</ref>\n\nResearch conducted by Yesilernis Pe\u00f1a, [[Jim Sidanius]] and Mark Sawyer in 2003, suggests that social discrimination is still prevalent, despite the low levels of economic discrimination.<ref>Pena, Y., Jim Sidanis and Mark Sawyer. 2003. ''Racial Democracy in the Americas: A Latin and US Comparison''. [[University of California]], Los Angeles.</ref>\nAfter considering the issue solved, the Cuban government moved beyond the issue of racism.  His message marked a shift in Cuban society's perception of racism that was triggered by the change in government focus.\"<ref name=\"Moore, C 1995\"/>  The government's announcement easily allowed the Cuban public to deny discrimination without first correcting the stereotypes that remained in the minds of those who grew up in a Cuba that was racially and economically divided. Many who argue that racism does not exist in Cuba base their claims on the idea of Latin American [[Exceptionalism]]. According to the argument of Latin American Exceptionality, a social history of intermarriage and mixing of the races is unique to Latina America. The large [[mestizo]] populations that result from high levels of interracial union common to Latin America are often linked to [[racial democracy]]. For many Cubans this translates into an argument of \"racial harmony\", often referred to as racial democracy. In the case of Cuba, ideas of Latin American Exceptionalism have delayed the progress of true racial harmony.<ref>Mark Sawyer. ''Racial Politics in Post- Revolutionary Cuba''.</ref>\n\nMost of the Latin population of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] in the 1950s was working class and lived in restricted areas, ethnic enclaves in the vicinity of Tampa's hundreds of cigar factories. African Cubans were tolerated to an extent in the Latin quarter (where most neighborhoods and cigar factories were integrated). [[Ybor City]] and its counterpart, [[West Tampa]], were areas that bordered on other restricted sections-areas for U.S. blacks or whites only. In this Latin quarter, there existed racial discrimination despite its subtleness.<ref>''Black Cuban, Black American''. Houston, Texas: Arte Publico Press, 130. Print.</ref>\n\n==Afrocubanismo==\n{{Main|Afrocubanismo}}\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s Cuba experienced a movement geared towards Afro-Cuban culture called Afrocubanismo.<ref>Arnedo-G\u00f3mez, M. \"Introduction.\" ''Writing Rumba''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2006: 1.</ref> The movement had a large impact on [[Cuban literature]], poetry, painting, music, and sculpture.  It was the first artistic campaign in [[Cuba]] that focused on one particular theme: African culture.  Specifically it highlighted the struggle for independence from Spain, African [[slavery]], and building a purely Cuban national identity.  Its goal was to incorporate African [[folklore]] and [[rhythm]] into traditional modes of art.\n\n===History of the movement===\nThe movement evolved from an interest in the rediscovery of African heritage.  It developed in two very different and parallel stages.  One stage stemmed from European artists and intellectuals who were interested in African art and musical folk forms.<ref>\"Afrocubanismo\", ''Encyclopedia of World Literature in the 20th Century''. Ed. Lenard S Klein. Continuum: Continuum Publishing Company, 2008: 20.</ref> This stage paralleled the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in New York, [[N\u00e9gritude]] in the [[French Caribbean]], and coincided with stylistic European Vanguard (like Cubism and its representation of African masks).  It was characterized by the participation of white intellectuals such as Cubans [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[R\u00f3mulo Lachata\u00f1er\u00e9]], [[Fortunato Vizcarrondo]], [[Fernando Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez|Fernando Ortiz]] and [[Lydia Cabrera]], Puerto Rican [[Luis Pal\u00e9s Matos]] and Spaniards [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Roger de Lauria]].  The African-inspired art tended to represent Afro-Cubans with clich\u00e9 images such as a black man sitting beneath a palm tree with a cigar.\n\nPoems and essays by Afro-Cuban writers began to be published in the 1930s in newspapers, magazines and books, where they discussed their own personal heritage.  Afro-Cuban and Afro-Cuban heritage artists such as Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n, Alberto Arredondo and Emilio Ballagas brought light to the once-marginalized African race and culture.  It became a symbol of empowerment and individuality for Afro-Cubans within the established Western culture of the Americas and Europe.<ref>Moore, R. \"The Minorista Vanguard: Modernism and Afrocubanismo.\" ''Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920-1940''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1997:200.</ref>\n\nThis empowerment became a catalyst for the second stage to be characterized by Afro-Cuban artists making art that truly reflected what it meant to be Afro-Cuban. Beginning in the 1930s this stage depicted a more serious view of black culture like African religions and the struggles associated with slavery.  The main [[protagonist]] during this stage of the movement was [[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]].<ref>Henken, T. \"Cuban Literature-The Avant-Garde vs the Vanguard: Colonial Literature\", in ''Cuba: A Global Studies Handbook''. Santa Barbara: ABC_CLIO, 2008: 363.</ref>\n\n===Results of the movement===\nThe lasting reputation of the Afrocubanismo movement was the establishment of a [[New World]] art form that used aesthetics from both European and African culture.<ref>\"Literature of the Revolutionary Era\", ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, history, culture''. Ed. Luis Martinez Ternandez. Wesport: Greenwood Press, 2003: 345.</ref> Although the actual movement of Afrocubanismo faded by the early 1940s, Afro-Cuban culture continues to play a vital role in the identity of Cuba.
