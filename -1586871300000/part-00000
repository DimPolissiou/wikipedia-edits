The show is set in Mirador de Montepinar, a condominium located in the suburbs of [[Madrid]]. The show is an indirect successor to the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] comedy ''[[Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva]]''. The name is a pun on the verb \"avecinarse\", which means both \"become neighbour to\" and \"approach\", and is used in expression ''la que se avecina'' meaning \"the trouble that is approaching\", so it alludes both to being neighbours and the friction that exists between the characters.\n\n''La que se avecina'' debuted on Telecinco, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n|FDF]] and [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Espa\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' vs 'La que se avecina': el duelo resucita en la TDT |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/15023/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-vs-la-que-se-avecina-el-duelo-resucita-en-la-tdt/ |work=FormulaTV |date=11 May 2010 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='La que se avecina' y 'Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' tambi\u00e9n triunfan en Paramount Comedy |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/23559/la-que-se-avecina-aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-tambien-triunfan-paramount-comedy/ |work=Formula TV |date=12 February 2012 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref> The series debuted on 22 April 2007, the show began to become much more prominent in its third season, becoming one of the most widely watched shows in Spain.

On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaqu\u00edn is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the show flat on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Mait\u00e9 Figueroa Espinosa and their three children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father. The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentine and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to marry Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Mait\u00e9 takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Mait\u00e9 remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Mait\u00e9 alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Mait\u00e9, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Mait\u00e9, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is Judith and Enrique's marriage. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first nine episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Mait\u00e9, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Mait\u00e9, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and marry. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Mait\u00e9 continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job at Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after six months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Mait\u00e9 leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Mait\u00e9 and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Mait\u00e9 will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn. Mait\u00e9 writes an erotic novel based on the romances of Mirador de Montepinar. Berta will go to a spa at her bachelorette party with the girls in the building and she will meet Araceli with whom she is about to go to bed when the owner of the spa (Araceli's girlfriend) sees them. Araceli when she breaks up with her, without a house, goes to Bajo B and will make Enrique and Teresa break up. Judith tries to return with Trevor but he already expects a son with another girl. Rebeca throws her out of the house and goes with Dylan to live with Enrique. La Chusa and Ferm\u00edn break up and she refuses to leave, even though she does not pay the rent. Raquel falls in love with Diego, Fina's son, but Fina intervenes and gets Diego to think that she is crazy. Antonio sees how his son is now: a woman. It happens to be called \u00c1lvaro a Alba. Alba starts dating Leo. Antonio and Berta marry. To Mait\u00e9 they publish the book to him and it is reconciled with Amador and buys with him the Under A, where La Chusa de okupa is. Enrique, fed up with Judith, Araceli and Teresa treating him badly, leaves them with a note.\n\n===Season 9 (2016)===\nVicente is named the new president of Mirador de Montepinar. His consort Ferm\u00edn, moves with him to 2\u00baB to help him with the mandate since Vicente is not excited. However, the power of these two will be full of ups and downs. Enrique returns to the community because his party has named him mayor after the departure of Mar\u00eda Teresa. Enrique will have to learn from Crist\u00f3bal, a corrupt politician. After eight seasons, Leo dies when the parachute is not opened in a gift from Alba. Alba overcomes her depression with Teodoro, Amador's brother, with whom she marries. Teodoro refloats his father-in-law Antonio's fishmonger, but his friendship is not earned. Alba will save to do the sex change operation and then will have to wait to be able to \"consummate\" which is what Theodore is waiting impatiently. After the departure of Rebeca, Judith will not stop giving emotional thrombi. Between his ligues they are: a trainer obsessed with the sport, a homosexual Catholic, a patient with an imaginary friend, Trevor, a millionaire friend of Javi ... At the end of the season he goes to Ibiza where he falls in love and leaves the Serie. Mait\u00e9 is again what it was like: a penny with money. With La Chusa as a maid, Mait\u00e9 pays Amador a salary to keep custody of her four children, some spoiled. Start a relationship with Hector, a hipster. Amador rents 2\u00baA with Teodoro. Then he meets Yolanda \"Yoli\" a seamstress with a safe and problematic character. Yoli will bring her mother, Menchu, noisy and like her daughter, causing several problems, such as: Causing Teodoro and Alba to leave the 2nd A and leave with Antonio and Berta, not accept that Amador leaves him and try to have children with him, renting Enrique the Low B after the departure of Araceli and settling in Attic A with his mother at the end of the season. Besides, they emphasize their fights with Mait\u00e9, Alba ... The relationship between Nines and Coque will go through problems. Fermin tries to conquer Araceli until she leaves. Fine take it with Javi and Lola, who are still fighting for their love despite their debts. Bruno is a pianist who has just been abandoned by his wife. She becomes a patient of Judith and needs her help so much that she moves to the 1st B, property of the late Leo. Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... In the end, the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has, so Mait\u00e9 hires a hit man. Theodore breaks up with Alba because he did not like it when they made love. The hit man shoots Amador but he covers himself with Theodore without knowing if he lives or dies. Diego returns, the son of Fina. Diego sees at last how his mother really is and it seems that he is going to send her to a nursing home. Besides, a relationship with Raquel begins, with which it seems that he is leaving for China. It is not known if Theodore lives or if Raquel and Fina have left.\n\n===Season 10 (2017\u201318)===\nFina escapes from the nursing home where she was interned and returns to live at 2&nbsp;\u00b0C. Berta and Antonio are still married but the latter wants them to live separately and goes to live with Enrique, leaving Berta living at 1&nbsp;\u00b0C along with her daughter Alba, who is now single because she has left him with Teodoro. Both will have to carry with difficulty the business of Mariscos Recios, before the passivity of its owner to 50%, Antonio. Alba will be attracted to Enrique throughout the season and will have several encounters behind Antonio's back. After the departure of Judith, are Yoli and Menchu who buy Attic A, characters that will cause multiple problems in the building. Ferm\u00edn, who continues his relationship with Menchu, will go live with them. In addition, he will continue to serve as \"Richelieu\" of the new president, Bruno Quiroga. The latter will try to maintain an asexual relationship with Mait\u00e9, who will also have meetings with Hector, who has returned to Montepinar. Coque ends his relationship with Nines and takes vacations, leaving the community with the vacant janitor plaza. In addition, he goes to live with Enrique and Antonio at Bajo B. The latter recover the bar from the catastrophic rental contract that Enrique maintained with Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, baptizing him as Tony and Henry. Nines leaves her job and instead it will be Alba who at first helps her father in the business. Theodore and Amador are again the only tenants of the second. The latter will try to recover Yoli's love, although she passes from him; Meanwhile, he will pretend to be Fina's caregiver in front of Diego, his son, in exchange for a salary and with the objective that Diego stays calm and stops visiting his mother so much. Diego will begin a relationship with Raquel and will take her to China although eventually she returns. Mait\u00e9 will have to share with her assistant La Chusa with Bruno, who also hires her and who also gets pregnant through artificial insemination. During Coque's vacation period, Ferm\u00edn hired Clara as her fellow, who is Menchu's niece and whom she recommends to minimize an important expense such as the janitor's salary.\n\n==Cast and

In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Mait\u00e9 Figueroa Espinosa and their three children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father. The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentine and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to marry Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Mait\u00e9 takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Mait\u00e9 remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Mait\u00e9 alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Mait\u00e9, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Mait\u00e9, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is Judith and Enrique's marriage. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first nine episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Mait\u00e9, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Mait\u00e9, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and marry. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Mait\u00e9 continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job at Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after six months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Mait\u00e9 leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Mait\u00e9 and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Mait\u00e9 will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn.

Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... Al final the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has, so Mait\u00e9 hires a hit man.

It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"the poem to Coleridge\".<ref>e g Dorothy Wordsworth's ''Journal'' 26 December 1801</ref> \n\nWordsworth was Britain's [[poet laureate]] from 1843 until his death from [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/PoetLaureate.aspx \"Poet Laureate\"], The British Monarchy official website.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of William Wordsworth}}\n\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named [[Wordsworth House]] in [[Cockermouth]], Cumberland,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1327088 |desc=Wordsworth House |accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref> part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the [[Lake District]]. William's sister, the poet and diarist [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the ''[[Earl of Abergavenny (1796 EIC ship)|Earl of Abergavenny]]'', was wrecked off the south coast of England; and [[Christopher Wordsworth (divine)|Christopher]], the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>Appendix A (Past Governors) of Allport, D. H., & N. J. Friskney, ''A Short History of Wilson's School'', Wilson's School Charitable Trust, 1986.</ref>\n\nWordsworth's father was a legal representative of [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]] and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783.<ref>Moorman 1968 pp. 5\u20137.</ref> However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by [[John Milton|Milton]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. William was also allowed to use his father's library.\nWilliam also spent time at his mother's parents' house in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.<ref>Moorman 1968:9\u201313.</ref>\n\nWordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and [[Shrove Tuesday]]. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'', but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.<ref>Moorman 1968:15\u201318.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Wordsworth's mother, in 1778, his father sent him to [[Hawkshead Grammar School]] in [[Lancashire]] (now in [[Cumbria]]) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in [[Yorkshire]]. She and William did not meet again for another nine years.\n\nWordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in ''[[The European Magazine]]''. That same year he began attending [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He received his BA degree in 1791.<ref>{{acad|id=WRDT787W|name=Wordsworth, William}}</ref> He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on [[Hiking#Walking tours today|walking tours]], visiting places famous for the beauty of their [[landscape]]. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the [[Alps]] extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.<ref name=\"Bennett2015\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Bennett|title=William Wordsworth in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPtDBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02841-8|page=191}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Annette Vallon==\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited [[Revolutionary France]] and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year.<ref name=webbio>Everett, Glenn, [http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/bio.html \"William Wordsworth: Biography\"] at The Victorian Web, accessed 7 January 2007.</ref> The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The [[Reign of Terror]] left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.\n\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]] again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in [[Calais]]. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=webbio/> Afterwards he wrote the sonnet \"[[It is a beauteous evening, calm and free]],\" recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline's marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled \u00a330 a year on her (equivalent to \u00a31,360 as of the year 2000), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.<ref>Gill (1989) pp. 208, 299</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/|publisher=MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==First publication and ''Lyrical Ballads''==\n[[File:William Wordsworth at 28 by William Shuter2.jpg|thumb|right|Wordsworth in 1798, about the time he began ''[[The Prelude]]''.<ref>\"[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/wordsworth.html The Cornell Wordsworth Collection]\". [[Cornell University]]. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref>]] The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections ''An Evening Walk'' and ''Descriptive Sketches''. In 1795 he received a legacy of \u00a3900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.\n\nIt was also in 1795 that he met [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset\u2014a property of the Pinney family\u2014to the west of [[Pilsdon Pen]]. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\n<blockquote>\"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Dorset Villages|author=Roland Gant|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|pages=111\u2013112|year=1980|isbn=0 7091 8135 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1797, the pair moved to [[Alfoxton House]], Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in [[Nether Stowey]]. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798), an important work in the English [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].<ref>{{Cite book |year=1798 |title=Lyricall Ballads: With a Few Other Poems    |edition=1 |publisher=  J. & A.

One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, \"[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]\", was published in this collection, along with Coleridge's \"[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]\".

Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' was published in 1805.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wordsworth |first= William |year=1805 |title=Lyrical Ballads with Pastoral and other Poems |edition=4 |publisher=Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, by R.

He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], the manager of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 132\u2013133.</ref>\n\n==Germany and move to the Lake District==\nWordsworth, Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness.<ref name=webbio/> During the harsh winter of 1798\u201399 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in [[Goslar]], and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled ''The Prelude''. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including \"[[The Lucy poems]]\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister's settling at [[Dove Cottage]] in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] in the Lake District, this time with another poet, [[Robert Southey]], nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"[[Lake Poets]]\".<ref>''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]''.</ref> Throughout this period many of Wordsworth's poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:Dove Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 70618.jpg|thumb|[[Dove Cottage]] (Town End, Grasmere) \u2013 home of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, 1799\u20131808; home of [[Thomas De Quincey]], 1809\u20131820]]\nIn 1802, Lowther's heir, [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], paid the \u00a34,000 owed to Wordsworth's father through Lowther's failure to pay his aide.<ref>Moorman 1968 p. 8</ref> It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=\"webbio\"/> Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\n\n*John Wordsworth (18 June 1803{{snd}}1875).

Married Fanny Graham and had four children: Mary Louisa, William, Reginald, Gordon\n\n==Autobiographical work and ''Poems, in Two Volumes''==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nWordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call ''The Recluse''. In 1798\u201399 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"[[The Prelude|poem to Coleridge]]\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called ''The Recluse''. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of ''[[The Prelude]]'', in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of ''The Recluse''. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\n[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rydal Mount]] \u2013 home to Wordsworth 1813\u20131850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]\nWordsworth's philosophical allegiances as articulated in ''[[The Prelude]]'' and in such shorter works as \"[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveler [[John \"Walking\" Stewart]] (1747\u20131822),<ref>[[Kelly Grovier]], \"Dream Walker: A Wordsworth Mystery Solved\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 16 February 2007</ref> who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from [[Madras]], India, through [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]], across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled ''The Apocalypse of Nature'' (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\n\nIn 1807 Wordsworth published ''[[Poems, in Two Volumes]]'', including \"[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]\". Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for ''Lyrical Ballads'', and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.\n\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter's opium addiction,<ref name=webbio/> and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of \u00a3400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to [[Rydal Mount]], [[Ambleside]] (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.<ref name=webbio/>\n\n==The Prospectus==\nIn 1814 Wordsworth published ''[[The Excursion]]'' as the second part of the three-part work ''The Recluse'', even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to ''The Recluse'' in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth's most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n                      ... my voice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted:{{mdash}}and how exquisitely, too{{mdash}}\nTheme this but little heard of among Men,\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish ...<ref>{{cite book|title=Poetical Works|location=London|publisher=Oxford U.P.|date=1936|series=Oxford Standard Authors|page=590}}</ref></poem>}}\n\nSome modern critics<ref>{{Cite book|title = Wordsworth's Poetry, 1787\u20131814|last = Hartman|first = Geoffrey|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 9780674958210|location = New Haven|pages = 329\u2013331}}</ref> suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life.<ref>Already in 1891 [[James Kenneth Stephen]] wrote satirically of Wordsworth having \"two voices\":  one is \"of the deep\", the other \"of an old half-witted sheep/Which bleats articulate monotony\".</ref> By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\n\nFollowing the death of his friend the painter [[William Green (painter)|William Green]] in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge.<ref>Sylvanus Urban, ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1823</ref> The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the [[Rhineland]] together.<ref name=webbio/> Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and [[Charles Lamb]] both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of [[James Hogg]]. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nWordsworth's youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge's, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established [[Church of England]], reflected in his ''Ecclesiastical Sketches'' of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours ''[[The Excursion]]'' (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century; it features three central characters, the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the [[French Revolution]]; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/religion1.html|title=Wordsworth's Religion|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\n==Laureateship and other honours==\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright [[Joanna Baillie]] reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"<ref name=\"Baillie2010\">{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Joanna|editor=Thomas McLean|title=Further Letters of Joanna Baillie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17xLwZQppO4C&pg=PA22|year=2010|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, NJ|isbn=978-0-8386-4149-1|page=181}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the [[University of Durham]] and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when [[John Keble]] praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth.<ref name=webbio/><ref>Gill, pp396-7</ref> (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble's immensely popular book of devotional poetry, ''The Christian Year'' (1827).<ref>http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/herb4.html#ww1</ref>) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses.

English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet who, with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], helped to launch the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]] in [[English literature]] with their joint publication ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798).\n\nWordsworth's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' is generally considered to be ''[[The Prelude]]'', a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"the poem to Coleridge\".<ref>e g Dorothy Wordsworth's ''Journal'' 26 December 1801</ref> \n\nWordsworth was Britain's [[poet laureate]] from 1843 until his death from [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/PoetLaureate.aspx \"Poet Laureate\"], The British Monarchy official website.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of William Wordsworth}}\n\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named [[Wordsworth House]] in [[Cockermouth]], Cumberland,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1327088 |desc=Wordsworth House |accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref> part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the [[Lake District]]. William's sister, the poet and diarist [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the ''[[Earl of Abergavenny (1796 EIC ship)|Earl of Abergavenny]]'', was wrecked off the south coast of England; and [[Christopher Wordsworth (divine)|Christopher]], the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>Appendix A (Past Governors) of Allport, D. H., & N. J. Friskney, ''A Short History of Wilson's School'', Wilson's School Charitable Trust, 1986.</ref>\n\nWordsworth's father was a legal representative of [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]] and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783.<ref>Moorman 1968 pp. 5\u20137.</ref> However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by [[John Milton|Milton]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. William was also allowed to use his father's library.\nWilliam also spent time at his mother's parents' house in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.<ref>Moorman 1968:9\u201313.</ref>\n\nWordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and [[Shrove Tuesday]]. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'', but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.<ref>Moorman 1968:15\u201318.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Wordsworth's mother, in 1778, his father sent him to [[Hawkshead Grammar School]] in [[Lancashire]] (now in [[Cumbria]]) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in [[Yorkshire]]. She and William did not meet again for another nine years.\n\nWordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in ''[[The European Magazine]]''. That same year he began attending [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He received his BA degree in 1791.<ref>{{acad|id=WRDT787W|name=Wordsworth, William}}</ref> He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on [[Hiking#Walking tours today|walking tours]], visiting places famous for the beauty of their [[landscape]]. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the [[Alps]] extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.<ref name=\"Bennett2015\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Bennett|title=William Wordsworth in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPtDBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02841-8|page=191}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Annette Vallon==\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited [[Revolutionary France]] and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year.<ref name=webbio>Everett, Glenn, [http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/bio.html \"William Wordsworth: Biography\"] at The Victorian Web, accessed 7 January 2007.</ref> The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The [[Reign of Terror]] left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.\n\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]] again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in [[Calais]]. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=webbio/> Afterwards he wrote the sonnet \"[[It is a beauteous evening, calm and free]],\" recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline's marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled \u00a330 a year on her (equivalent to \u00a31,360 as of the year 2000), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.<ref>Gill (1989) pp. 208, 299</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/|publisher=MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==First publication and ''Lyrical Ballads''==\n[[File:William Wordsworth at 28 by William Shuter2.jpg|thumb|right|Wordsworth in 1798, about the time he began ''[[The Prelude]]''.<ref>\"[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/wordsworth.html The Cornell Wordsworth Collection]\". [[Cornell University]]. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref>]] The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections ''An Evening Walk'' and ''Descriptive Sketches''. In 1795 he received a legacy of \u00a3900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.\n\nIt was also in 1795 that he met [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset\u2014a property of the Pinney family\u2014to the west of [[Pilsdon Pen]]. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\n<blockquote>\"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Dorset Villages|author=Roland Gant|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|pages=111\u2013112|year=1980|isbn=0 7091 8135 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1797, the pair moved to [[Alfoxton House]], Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in [[Nether Stowey]]. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798), an important work in the English [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].<ref>{{Cite book |year=1798 |title=Lyricall Ballads: With a Few Other Poems    |edition=1 |publisher=  J. & A.

Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' was published in 1805.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wordsworth |first= William |year=1805 |title=Lyrical Ballads with Pastoral and other Poems |edition=4 |publisher=Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, by R.

He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], the manager of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 132\u2013133.</ref>\n\n==Germany and move to the Lake District==\nWordsworth, Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness.<ref name=webbio/> During the harsh winter of 1798\u201399 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in [[Goslar]], and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled ''The Prelude''. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including \"[[The Lucy poems]]\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister's settling at [[Dove Cottage]] in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] in the Lake District, this time with another poet, [[Robert Southey]], nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"[[Lake Poets]]\".<ref>''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]''.</ref> Throughout this period many of Wordsworth's poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:Dove Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 70618.jpg|thumb|[[Dove Cottage]] (Town End, Grasmere) \u2013 home of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, 1799\u20131808; home of [[Thomas De Quincey]], 1809\u20131820]]\nIn 1802, Lowther's heir, [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], paid the \u00a34,000 owed to Wordsworth's father through Lowther's failure to pay his aide.<ref>Moorman 1968 p. 8</ref> It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=\"webbio\"/> Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\n\n*John Wordsworth (18 June 1803{{snd}}1875).

In 1798\u201399 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"[[The Prelude|poem to Coleridge]]\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called ''The Recluse''. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of ''[[The Prelude]]'', in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of ''The Recluse''. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\n[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rydal Mount]] \u2013 home to Wordsworth 1813\u20131850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]\nWordsworth's philosophical allegiances as articulated in ''[[The Prelude]]'' and in such shorter works as \"[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveler [[John \"Walking\" Stewart]] (1747\u20131822),<ref>[[Kelly Grovier]], \"Dream Walker: A Wordsworth Mystery Solved\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 16 February 2007</ref> who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from [[Madras]], India, through [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]], across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled ''The Apocalypse of Nature'' (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\n\nIn 1807 Wordsworth published ''[[Poems, in Two Volumes]]'', including \"[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]\". Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for ''Lyrical Ballads'', and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.\n\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter's opium addiction,<ref name=webbio/> and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of \u00a3400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to [[Rydal Mount]], [[Ambleside]] (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.<ref name=webbio/>\n\n==The Prospectus==\nIn 1814 Wordsworth published ''[[The Excursion]]'' as the second part of the three-part work ''The Recluse'', even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to ''The Recluse'' in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth's most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n                      ... my voice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted:{{mdash}}and how exquisitely, too{{mdash}}\nTheme this but little heard of among Men,\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish ...<ref>{{cite book|title=Poetical Works|location=London|publisher=Oxford U.P.|date=1936|series=Oxford Standard Authors|page=590}}</ref></poem>}}\n\nSome modern critics<ref>{{Cite book|title = Wordsworth's Poetry, 1787\u20131814|last = Hartman|first = Geoffrey|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 9780674958210|location = New Haven|pages = 329\u2013331}}</ref> suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life.<ref>Already in 1891 [[James Kenneth Stephen]] wrote satirically of Wordsworth having \"two voices\":  one is \"of the deep\", the other \"of an old half-witted sheep/Which bleats articulate monotony\".</ref> By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\n\nFollowing the death of his friend the painter [[William Green (painter)|William Green]] in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge.<ref>Sylvanus Urban, ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1823</ref> The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the [[Rhineland]] together.<ref name=webbio/> Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and [[Charles Lamb]] both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of [[James Hogg]]. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nWordsworth's youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge's, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established [[Church of England]], reflected in his ''Ecclesiastical Sketches'' of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours ''[[The Excursion]]'' (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century; it features three central characters, the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the [[French Revolution]]; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/religion1.html|title=Wordsworth's Religion|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\n==Laureateship and other honours==\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright [[Joanna Baillie]] reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"<ref name=\"Baillie2010\">{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Joanna|editor=Thomas McLean|title=Further Letters of Joanna Baillie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17xLwZQppO4C&pg=PA22|year=2010|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, NJ|isbn=978-0-8386-4149-1|page=181}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the [[University of Durham]] and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when [[John Keble]] praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth.<ref name=webbio/><ref>Gill, pp396-7</ref> (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble's immensely popular book of devotional poetry, ''The Christian Year'' (1827).<ref>http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/herb4.html#ww1</ref>) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression, he completely gave up writing new material.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:WilliamWordsworth Grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Gravestone of William Wordsworth, [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], Cumbria]]\nWilliam Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850,<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 422\u20133.</ref> and was buried at [[St Oswald's Church, Grasmere]]. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical \"Poem to Coleridge\" as ''[[The Prelude]]'' several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nWordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:\n*William Kinsolving \u2013 ''Mister Christian''. 1996\n*[[Jasper Fforde]] - ''The Eyre Affair''. 2001\n*[[Val McDermid]] \u2013 ''The Grave Tattoo''. 2006\n*\"The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere\" by Sue Limb. 2008\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1966 [[Fantastic Voyage#Novelization|novelization]] of the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth's ''[[The Prelude]]'' as the miniaturized submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the \"strange seas of thought\".\n\n==Major works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=27em|\n* ''[[Lyrical Ballads]], with a Few Other Poems'' (1798)\n** \"Simon Lee\"\n** \"[[We are Seven]]\"\n** \"[[Lines Written in Early Spring]]\"\n** \"[[Expostulation and Reply]]\"\n** \"[[The Tables Turned]]\"\n** \"The Thorn\"\n** \"[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Lines Composed A Few Miles above Tintern Abbey]]\"\n* ''[[Lyrical Ballads]], with Other Poems'' (1800) {{Dubious|date=January 2018}}\n** [[Preface to the Lyrical Ballads]]\n** \"[[Strange fits of passion have I known]]\"<ref name=Lucy>M.

He was drafted into the military and worked on the production of [[plutonium]] for the [[Manhattan Project]].  After his discharge in 1946, Jess worked at the [[Hanford Atomic Energy Project]] in [[Richland, Washington]], and painted in his spare time, but his dismay at the threat of [[atomic weapon]]s led him to abandon his scientific career and focus on his art.\n\nIn 1949, Jess enrolled in the California School of the Arts (now the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]) and, after breaking with his family, began referring to himself simply as \"Jess\".  He met [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]] in 1951 and began a relationship with the poet that lasted until Duncan's death in 1988.  In 1952, in San Francisco, Jess, with Duncan and painter [[Harry Jacobus]], opened the [[King Ubu Gallery]], which became an important venue for alternative art and which remained so when, in 1954, poet [[Jack Spicer]] reopened the space as the [[Six Gallery reading|Six Gallery]].\n\nMany of Jess's paintings and [[collage]]s have themes drawn from [[chemistry]], [[alchemy]], the [[occult]], and male beauty, including a series called ''Translations'' (1959\u20131976) which is done with heavily laid-on paint in a [[paint-by-number]] style. In 1975, the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] displayed six of the \"Translations\" paintings in their ''Matrix 2'' exhibition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://2gc0771gkd8m295j5p2hvgje72l.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Matrix-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060723/http://2gc0771gkd8m295j5p2hvgje72l.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Matrix-2.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-07 |df= }}</ref> In the late 1950s, Jess also filled [[Pauline Kael]]'s home on Oregon St in Berkeley, CA, with fantastical and Romantic murals, which still adorn the walls today. Collins also created elaborate collages using old book illustrations and [[comic strip]]s (particularly, the strip ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', which he used to make his own strip ''Tricky Cad'').  Jess's final work, ''Narkissos'', is a complex rendered 6'x5' drawing owned by the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].\n\nA Jess retrospective (''Jess: A Grand Collage, 1951\u20131993'') toured the United States in 1993 to 1994, accompanied by a book of the same title.  The book included pictures of some of the paintings and collages from the tour. Interspersed between the pictures were essays by various contributors including poet [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]] who wrote an extended piece on Jess's ''Narkissos.''\n\nSections of Jess's paintings 'Arkadia Last Resort' were used by [[Faithless]] in 2004 for the front covers to their single \"[[I Want More (Faithless song)|I Want More]]\".\n\nIn 2008, an exhibition of Jess's drawings was held at [[Gallery Paule Anglim]] in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.gallerypauleanglim.com/Gallery_Paule_Anglim/Jess.html Gallery Paule Anglim, Artist profile Jess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331032329/http://www.gallerypauleanglim.com/Gallery_Paule_Anglim/Jess.html |date=2012-03-31 }}, February 6 - March 1, 2008</ref>\n\n== Museum collections ==\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/96.492/|title=Jess, Narkissos, 1976-1991|last=|first=|date=|website=SFMOMA|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://art.famsf.org/jess-burgess-franklin-collins/enamord-mage-translation-6-200587|title=The Enamord Mage: Translation #6 - Jess (Burgess Franklin Collins)|date=2015-05-08|website=FAMSF Search the Collections|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\ndi Rosa<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collection|url=http://www.dirosaart.org/about/the-collection/|website=dirosaart.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York City, NY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/2913?locale=en|title=Jess {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, NY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/626876?searchField=All&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;who=Jess$Jess&amp;ft=*&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=1|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.97502.html|title=Ex. 5 - Mind's I: Translation #12|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crockerart.org/collections/american-art-after-1945/artworks/feignting-spell-1954|title=Feignting Spell, 1954|website=Crocker Art Museum|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''O!

He was drafted into the military and worked on the production of [[plutonium]] for the [[Manhattan Project]].  After his discharge in 1946, Jess worked at the [[Hanford Atomic Energy Project]] in [[Richland, Washington]], and painted in his spare time, but his dismay at the threat of [[atomic weapon]]s led him to abandon his scientific career and focus on his art.\n\nIn 1949, Jess enrolled in the California School of the Arts (now the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]) and, after breaking with his family, began referring to himself simply as \"Jess\".  He met [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]] in 1951 and began a relationship with the poet that lasted until Duncan's death in 1988.  In 1952, in San Francisco, Jess, with Duncan and painter [[Harry Jacobus]], opened the [[King Ubu Gallery]], which became an important venue for alternative art and which remained so when, in 1954, poet [[Jack Spicer]] reopened the space as the [[Six Gallery reading|Six Gallery]].\n\nMany of Jess's paintings and [[collage]]s have themes drawn from [[chemistry]], [[alchemy]], the [[occult]], and male beauty, including a series called ''Translations'' (1959\u20131976) which is done with heavily laid-on paint in a [[paint-by-number]] style. In 1975, the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] displayed six of the \"Translations\" paintings in their ''Matrix 2'' exhibition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://2gc0771gkd8m295j5p2hvgje72l.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Matrix-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060723/http://2gc0771gkd8m295j5p2hvgje72l.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Matrix-2.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-07 |df= }}</ref> In the late 1950s, Jess also filled [[Pauline Kael]]'s home on Oregon St in Berkeley, CA, with fantastical and Romantic murals, which still adorn the walls today. Collins also created elaborate collages using old book illustrations and [[comic strip]]s (particularly, the strip ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', which he used to make his own strip ''Tricky Cad'').  Jess's final work, ''Narkissos'', is a complex rendered 6'x5' drawing owned by the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].\n\nA Jess retrospective (''Jess: A Grand Collage, 1951\u20131993'') toured the United States in 1993 to 1994, accompanied by a book of the same title.  The book included pictures of some of the paintings and collages from the tour. Interspersed between the pictures were essays by various contributors including poet [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]] who wrote an extended piece on Jess's ''Narkissos.''\n\nSections of Jess's paintings 'Arkadia Last Resort' were used by [[Faithless]] in 2004 for the front covers to their single \"[[I Want More (Faithless song)|I Want More]]\".\n\nIn 2008, an exhibition of Jess's drawings was held at [[Gallery Paule Anglim]] in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.gallerypauleanglim.com/Gallery_Paule_Anglim/Jess.html Gallery Paule Anglim, Artist profile Jess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331032329/http://www.gallerypauleanglim.com/Gallery_Paule_Anglim/Jess.html |date=2012-03-31 }}, February 6 - March 1, 2008</ref>\n\n== Museum collections ==\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/96.492/|title=Jess, Narkissos, 1976-1991|last=|first=|date=|website=SFMOMA|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://art.famsf.org/jess-burgess-franklin-collins/enamord-mage-translation-6-200587|title=The Enamord Mage: Translation #6 - Jess (Burgess Franklin Collins)|date=2015-05-08|website=FAMSF Search the Collections|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\ndi Rosa<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collection|url=http://www.dirosaart.org/about/the-collection/|website=dirosaart.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York City, NY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/2913?locale=en|title=Jess {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, NY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/626876?searchField=All&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;who=Jess$Jess&amp;ft=*&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=1|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.97502.html|title=Ex. 5 - Mind's I: Translation #12|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crockerart.org/collections/american-art-after-1945/artworks/feignting-spell-1954|title=Feignting Spell, 1954|website=Crocker Art Museum|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''O!

However, as technology has evolved, the sources of energy used in power plants has evolved as well.<ref name=\":02\" /> The introduction of more renewable/sustainable forms of energy has caused an increase in the improvement and creation of certain power plants.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Hydroelectric power plants ===\n[[File:Diablo Dam (from WA SR 20).jpg|thumb|239x239px|Hydroelectric Dam]]\n[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric power plants]] generate power using the force of water to turn generators. They can be categorized into three different types; impoundment, diversion and pumped storage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/types-hydropower-plants|title=Types of Hydropower Plants {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> Impoundment and diversion hydroelectric power plants operate similarly in that each involves creating a barrier to keep water from flowing at an uncontrollable rate, and then controlling the flow rate of water to pass through turbines to create electricity at an ideal level. Mechanical engineers are in charge of calculating flow rates and other volumetric calculations necessary to turn the generators at the electrical engineers specifications. Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants operate in a similar manner but only function at peak hours of power demand. At calm hours the water is pumped uphill, then is released at peak hours to flow from a high to low elevation to turn turbines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hyhowworks.html|title=Hydroelectric Power: How it works, USGS Water-Science School|last=USGS|first=Howard Perlman|website=water.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> The engineering knowledge required to assess the performance of pumped storage hydroelectric power plants is very similar to that of the impoundment and diversion power plants.\n\n=== Thermal power plants ===\n[[File:Komatsu bulldozer pushing coal in Power plant Ljubljana (winter 2017).jpg|thumb|238x238px|Coal being pushed into coal power plant]]\n[[Thermal power station|Thermal power plants]] are split into two different categories; those that create electricity by burning fuel and those that create electricity via prime mover. A common example of a thermal power plant that produces electricity by the consumption of fuel is the nuclear power plant. Nuclear power plants use a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear reactor's]] heat to turn water into steam.<ref name=\":02\" /> This steam is sent through a turbine which is connected to an electric generator to generate electricity. [[Nuclear power plant]]s account for 20% of [[Energy in the United States|America's electricity generation]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://thermal-powerplant.blogspot.com/2010/05/thermal-power-plant-classification.html|title=Thermal Power Plant Classification|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> Another example of a fuel burning power plant is [[Fossil fuel power station|coal power plant]]. [[Fossil fuel power station|Coal power plants]] generate 50% of the United States' electricity supply.<ref name=\":2\" /> Coal power plants operate in a manner similar to nuclear power plants in that the heat from the burning coal powers a steam turbine and electric generator.<ref name=\":02\" /> There are several types of engineers that work in a Thermal Power Plant.

Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role), but withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth, where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, and they team up with a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her last film role), who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd.]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], Charlie B. Barkin and his best friend Itchy Itchiford escape from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] and return to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie and Itchy getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Anaida R. Garcia. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990. For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick.

The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', had been backed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and executive producers [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] (for ''The Land Before Time'' only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable.<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html |title=Don Bluth American Tail |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cawley_land\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html The Land Before Time]''</ref> The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' and it, were completed under the deal).<ref name=\"cawley_ireland\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBireland.html At Home in Ireland]''</ref> The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film's production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media (though the cut-out scenes of Charlie's nightmare about being condemned was discovered by [[YouTube]] on October 29, 2016, therefore ''The Land Before Time'' was not included the cut-out scenes (due to being produced by Amblin Entertainment).<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\n\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth's first feature film, ''The Secret of NIMH''.

Barkin (voiced by [[Burt Reynolds]]), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by [[Vic Tayback]], in his penultimate film role), but withdraws from his place in Heaven to return to Earth, where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by [[Dom DeLuise]]), still lives, and they team up with a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by [[Judith Barsi]] in her last film role), who teaches them an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.\n\nThe film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by [[Goldcrest Films]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd.]]. On its cinema release, it competed directly with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth's previous feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling [[VHS]] releases ever. It inspired a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2|theatrical sequel]], a [[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series|television series]], and a [[An All Dogs Christmas Carol|holiday direct-to-video film]].\n\n''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released on [[DVD]] on November 17, 1998, and as an [[MGM Kids]] edition on March 6, 2001. It had a DVD double-feature release with its sequel on March 14, 2006, and January 18, 2011. The film was released in high definition for the first time on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011, without special features except the original theatrical trailer.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn 1939 [[New Orleans]], Charlie B. Barkin and his best friend Itchy Itchiford escape from the [[Animal shelter|dog pound]] and return to their [[casino]] [[riverboat]] on the [[bayou]], formerly run by Charlie himself and his business partner, Carface Caruthers. Refusing to share the profits with Charlie, Carface had been responsible for Charlie and Itchy getting committed to the pound and persuades Charlie to leave town with half of the casino's earnings. Charlie agrees, but is later [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] and killed by a car pushed downhill by Carface and his assistant, Killer. Charlie is sent to [[Heaven]] by default despite not having done any good deeds in his life; a [[whippet]] [[angel]] explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Charlie cheats death by stealing a [[gold]] [[pocket watch]] representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven; when the watch stops again, he will be sent to [[Hell]] instead. However, as long as the watch continues to run, Charlie will be immortal.\n\nAfter Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business, they discover that Carface has kidnapped a young orphaned girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves advantageous when betting on races. Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the [[Poverty|poor]] and help her find a family. The next day at the race track, Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become alarmed by her ragged appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie, upon realizing that she has been used, threatens to leave. To persuade her to stay, Charlie brings [[pizza]] to a family of poor puppies and their mother, Flo, at the old abandoned church. While there, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie for stealing the wallet. As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple, Kate and Harold. While they privately discuss adopting her, Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of King Gator, a giant effeminate [[alligator]]. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie contracts [[pneumonia]].\n\nCarface and his thugs destroy Charlie's casino and attack Itchy. An injured Itchy limps back to the church and confronts Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie, who Itchy thinks matters more than him. In his exasperation, Charlie loudly proclaims that he is using her and will eventually \"dump her in an orphanage\". Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface's casino, where he is ambushed by Carface and his thugs. They fight with Charlie, inadvertently setting an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie's pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface. In the chaos, both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water. Unable to rescue both at the same time, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and places her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety; however, the watch stops before he can reach it, ending his life. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in [[ghost]] form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where Carface finally arrives and takes his own clock, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that \"he'll be back\" before winking and retrieving his halo.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Charlie B. Barkin, a brash [[German Shepherd]] and a former [[Confidence trick|con artist]]. The character was designed specifically with Reynolds in mind for the role and the animators mimicked some of his mannerisms.\n** Reynolds is succeeded by [[Charlie Sheen]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'', and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] for ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]'' and ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. The model for the character of Charlie was a German Shepherd, appropriately named Burt. Burt the dog often spent time with the animators at the studio, even going with them during the studio's move to [[Ireland]].\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchy Itchiford, a [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[Anxiety|anxious]] but loyal [[Dachshund]].\n** DeLuise reprised his role in ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol''.\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Anne-Marie, a 7-year-old orphan girl with the [[Animal language|ability to talk to and understand animals]]. Her singing voice was performed by Anaida R. Garcia. This was Barsi's final film role before her murder in 1988. The ending credits song \"Love Survives\" was dedicated in her memory as her character became absent in the further franchise.\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Carface Caruthers, a violent, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] mixed blue-nosed [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]/[[Bulldog]] gangster. This was Tayback's final film role before his death in 1990. For ''All Dogs Go to Heaven 2'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series'' and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'', [[Ernest Borgnine]] took Tayback's role.\n* [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Killer, a misnamed, fidgety, [[Neurosis|neurotic]] and spectacles-wearing [[Schnoodle]] who is Carface's [[comic relief]] sidekick. Reilly was the second original voice actor that reprised his role in the series and ''An All Dogs Christmas Carol'' except for the sequel.\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Flo, a female [[Rough Collie]] and Charlie's friend.\n* [[Melba Moore]] as a [[Whippet]] angel who welcomes deceased dogs into Heaven. She was named \"Annabelle\" in the 1996 sequel and its subsequent syndicated television series. [[Bebe Neuwirth]] succeeded Melba in this role.  \n* [[Ken Page]] as King Gator, an [[American alligator]] and [[New Orleans voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] living below the streets of [[New Orleans]].\n* Rob Fuller and Earleen Carey as Kate and Harold, a married couple who later become Anne-Marie's adoptive parents.\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as [[Terrier]], a dog that appears when Itchy tells everyone Anne-Marie is in danger.\n* [[Anna Manahan]] as Stella Dallas, a horse that appears when Anne-Marie, Charlie, and Itchy are at the derby. She is against the Once Upon a Wintertime Team. \n* [[Candy Devine]] as Vera, a female gambling dog.\n\n==Production==\nThe earliest idea for the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. The [[film treatment|treatment]] was originally about a canine [[private investigator|private eye]], and one of three short stories making up an [[anthology film]]. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, [[John Pomeroy]] and [[Gary Goldman]], and rewritten by [[David N. Weiss]], collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and drew inspiration from films, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' and ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]''. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how \"provocative\" it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.\n\nDuring the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from [[Van Nuys, California]], to a state-of-the-art studio facility in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', had been backed by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and executive producers [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] (for ''The Land Before Time'' only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable.<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html |title=Don Bluth American Tail |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cawley_land\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html The Land Before Time]''</ref> The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' and it, were completed under the deal).<ref name=\"cawley_ireland\">Cawley, ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBireland.html At Home in Ireland]''</ref> The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film's production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\">{{cite web |author=Cawley, John |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |title=Don Bluth All Dogs Heaven |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |publisher=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103084802/http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed Reynolds and DeLuise to [[ad-lib]] extensively; Bluth later commented, \"their ad-libs were often better than the original script\".<ref name=\"beck\">*{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|date=October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1-55652-591-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/13 13\u201314]}} p.14</ref> However, Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, \"Great script, kid\", as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds' then-wife.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" /> Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]] in Bluth's previous film ''The Land Before Time'', was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was released.<ref name=\"cawley_dogs\" />\n\nAs production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some of the scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Writer and producer Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie's nightmare about being [[Damnation|condemned]]. Co-director Gary Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Don Bluth owned a private 35-mm print of the movie with the cut-out scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest Films on releasing a director's cut of the film after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth's locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media (though the cut-out scenes of Charlie's nightmare about being condemned was discovered by [[YouTube]] on October 29, 2016, therefore ''The Land Before Time'' was not included the cut-out scenes (due to being produced by Amblin Entertainment).<ref name=\"Ask Us Questions at donbluth.com\">Ask Us Questions at [donbluth.com]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = All Dogs Go to Heaven Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 1, 1989<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Dogs-Heaven-Various-artists/dp/B00R4PB5E4 |title=All Dogs Go To Heaven: Various artists |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 33:18\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Ralph Burns]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Don Bluth Music of Films\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Land Before Time]]\n | prev_year  = 1988\n | title      = All Dogs Go to Heaven\n | year       = 1989\n | next_title = [[Rock-a-Doodle]]\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}\n}}\n\nThe music for ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was composed by [[Ralph Burns]] with lyrics by [[Charles Strouse]], T.J.

Don Bluth and his studio had no involvement with any of them, and Burt Reynolds did not reprise his role as Charlie after the first film; he was replaced in the sequel film and television series by [[Charlie Sheen]] and [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]], respectively. Charles Nelson Reilly declined to return for the sequel film, but voiced Killer for the television productions.
