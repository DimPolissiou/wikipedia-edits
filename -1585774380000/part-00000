Sears purchased them, then sold them at a low price to the station agents and made a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it \"R.W. Sears Watch Company.\" Within the first year, he met Alvah C. Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago; later that year, the R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. \n[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|170px|Julius Rosenwald]]\nIn 1889 Sears sold his business for [[US$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.1|1889|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-W-Sears|title=Richard W. Sears \u2013 American merchant |website=britannica.com}}</ref> Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to '''Sears, Roebuck & Company''' and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. \n\nBefore the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies\u2014often at high prices and on credit\u2014from local [[general store]]s with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated, and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. \n\nBy 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items such as sewing machines, bicycles, [[sports equipment|sporting goods]], and automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by [[Lincoln Motor Car Works]] of Chicago, no relation to the current [[Lincoln (automobile)|Ford line]]).<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90.</ref> By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.4|1893|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) two years later.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/history1890s.htm \"Sears History \u2013 1890s.\"] ''Sears''. Last updated September 27, 2004.</ref> By 1896, dolls, stoves, and groceries had been added to the catalog.\n\n[[File:Sears Merchandise Building Tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The exterior of the [[Sears Merchandise Building Tower]]]]\nDespite the strong and growing sales, the national [[Panic of 1893]] led to a full-scale [[recession]], causing a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise by 1895. Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman [[Aaron Nusbaum]], who in turn brought in his brother-in-law [[Julius Rosenwald]], to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.075|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.15|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by [[Albert Henry Loeb]] of Chicago law firm Loeb & Adler (now [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.<ref>Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years (2013).</ref>\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903 (${{Inflation|US|1.3|1903|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 47\u201353</ref> Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.\n\nIn September 1904, a freight elevator carrying 10 people fell three stories at a Sears store in Chicago, killing two people and seriously injuring six others. The freight elevator was being used because the passenger elevator was out of service for repairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Killed And Six Injured in Accident In Chicago Store |publisher=[[Indiana Democrat]] |date=7 September 1904 |url=http://www.gendisasters.com/illinois/15491/chicago-il-elevator-accident-sep-1904}}</ref>\n\nSales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million (${{Inflation|US|0.04|1906|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). They had to incorporate a new company in order to bring the operation public; Sears and Rosenwald established '''Sears, Roebuck and Company''' with the legal name '''Sears, Roebuck and Co.''', in the state of New York, which effectively replaced the original company.<ref>https://cepi.io/companies/sears-roebuck-and-co-/us_ny/27644 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042417/https://cepi.io/companies/sears-roebuck-and-co-/us_ny/27644 |date=December 1, 2017}} Sears, Roebuck and Company (Co.) 1906 New York incorporation</ref> The current company inherits the history of the old company, celebrating the original 1892 incorporation, rather than the 1906 revision, as the start of the company.\n\nSears' successful 1906 [[initial public offering]] (IPO) marks the first major retail IPO in American financial history and represented a coming of age, financially, of the consumer sector.<ref>Gregory D.

The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973, when the [[Sears Tower]] was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million (${{Inflation|US|0.050|1907|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 53\u201357</ref>\n\nThe company was badly hurt during [[Post\u2013World War I recession|1919\u201321 as a severe depression]] hit the nation's farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings.

Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.<ref>Peter M.

Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in [[Robert E. Wood]] to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail-order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It de-emphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists\u2014set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, \"Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924\u201342,\" ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238\u2013279</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the US, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing [[central business district]]s), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the [[Homart Development Company]] for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance Company]] in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934. Over the decades it established major national brands, such as [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]], [[Diehard (type of battery)|DieHard]], [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]], [[Supertone Records|Supertone]], and [[Toughskins]]. The company became a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] during the mid-20th century, adding [[Dean Witter]] and [[Coldwell Banker]] real estate in 1981, starting [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] as a joint venture with [[IBM]] in 1984, and introducing the [[Discover Card|Discover credit card]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, Sears completed the 110-story [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] in Chicago, which became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|world's tallest building]], a title it took from the former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York.

In March 2009 London-based insurer [[Willis Group Holdings|Willis Group Holdings, Ltd.]], was given the building's naming rights to encourage them to occupy the building. The official renaming as the ''Willis Tower'' took place on Thursday, July 16, 2009, during a public ceremony hosted by Willis Group Holdings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE52B54J20090312 |title=Tallest U.S. building to get new name |work=Reuters |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Conlon}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, the company began divesting itself of many non-retail entities, which were detrimental to the company's bottom line. Sears spun off its financial services arm which included brokerage business Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card.

The company discontinued the catalog in 1993. It dismissed 50,000 workers who had filled the orders. This was before the internet became an effective tool. With the advantage of hindsight, the timing was poor; Sears already had in place what it took [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] years to achieve.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nSears eventually held sales on all items. The dedicated customer would just wait until the item was on sale to buy. In the meantime, the item took up valuable floor space. This was a marketing policy misjudgment.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nAfter weeks of speculation in 1998, Sears announced it had sold the remnants of Western Auto to [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]-based [[Advance Auto Parts]]. The business deal was not quite what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected. Specifically in return, Sears Roebuck became \"one of the largest shareholders\" after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto's wholesale and retail operations. More precisely, the existing store network of Advance Auto Parts, comprising 915 stores in 17 U.S. states, merged with 590 U.S.-based Parts America Stores in addition to 40 Western Auto stores in the [[Puerto Rico|Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]].\n\nIn 1997 Sears sold 85% of [[Sears (Mexico)|its Mexico affiliate]] to [[Grupo Carso]]. Sears Holdings continues to produce specialty catalogs and reintroduced a smaller version of the Holiday Wish Book in 2007. In 2003, Sears sold its U.S. retail credit card operation to [[Citibank]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sorkin |first=Andrew Ross |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/business/sears-to-sell-card-portfolio-to-citigroup-for-3-billion.html |title=Sears to Sell Card Portfolio To Citigroup For $3 Billion |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 2003 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}</ref> The remaining card operations for Sears Canada were sold to [[JPMorgan Chase]] in August 2005.<ref name=\"ct-2005sep01\">{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-09-01-0509010046-story.html |title=JPMorgan to buy credit card unit of Sears Canada |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 1, 2005 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref> In 2003, Sears opened a new concept store called Sears Grand.

As a part of the acquisition, Kmart Holding Corporation along with Sears Roebuck & Co. was transformed into the new [[Sears Holdings Corporation]].

It sponsored the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series|Truck Series]], using the Craftsman brand as the title sponsor, from the series' inception in the [[1995 NASCAR SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman]] to the [[2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2008 season]], when the agreement ended.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/news/breaking_news/story/388059.html \"Craftsman Dropping Sponsorship of NASCAR Truck Series\"]. ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. December 4, 2007.</ref> Craftsman tools remain the official tools of NASCAR. The company sponsored the television series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''. It sponsors and currently has naming rights to the [[Sears Centre]], an 11,000-seat multi-purpose family entertainment, cultural and sports center, constructed in 2006 in Hoffman Estates. The company also underwrote the [[PBS]] television series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', under the name The Sears-Roebuck Foundation from the show's premiere in 1968 until 1992. It sponsored the #10 [[Gillett Evernham Motorsports]] car of Scott Riggs for the September 2, 2007, running of the [[Sharp AQUOS 500]] at [[California Speedway]] through its Sears Auto Center branch. However, Riggs failed to qualify for the event.\nIn 2016, Craftsman became the title sponsor of the World Racing Group, World of Outlaws Sprint car racing series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woosprint.com/sponsors|title=World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series \u2013 Sponsors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Employee relations==\n[[File:Sears Centro Historico.jpg|thumb|Sears building in the [[Edificio La Nacional]] building in Mexico City, across from the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].]]\nSears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done \"to be successful in this highly competitive environment\".<ref>\"600-plus Sears jobs to be cut\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1992</ref>\n\nIn early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of \"base items\" from the electronic department was cut to 1%. As of 2017, appliances is the only remaining department where compensation is based entirely on commission. Other departments give a base pay plus commission. In many stores, jewelry department associates receive a low base salary with 1% commission on their sales.\n\nIn March 2019, Sears claimed that it was ending life insurance benefits for an undisclosed number of its 90,000 retirees. A few months earlier the company handed out over $25 million in bonuses to executives.<ref>{{cite news |last= Folley|first=Aris|date=March 30, 2019|title=Sears cutting life insurance benefits for up to 90,000 retirees: report|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/436593-sears-cuts-life-insurance-benefits-for-up-to-90000-retirees|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|location= |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> This key Sears Retiree Benefit was worth between $5,000 and $15,000 for most of the pool (29,000) of eligible retired employees.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mooney|first=John|date=July 30, 2019|title=Sears Retiree Benefit|url=https://choiceseniorlife.com/2019/07/what-do-you-do-when-sears-cancels-your-life-insurance-policy/ |website=ChoiceSeniorLife.com}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2019, former Sears Holdings chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert, months after purchasing the remains of Sears from the holding company, threatened not to pay out the $43 million in pension payments<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/business/sears-severance/index.html|title=Sears' owner wants to get out of paying $43 million in severance to former employees|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> owed to 90,000 former Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-fears-eddie-lampert-would-wipe-out-sears-pension-plans|title=Government fears Eddie Lampert would wipe out Sears' pension plans|last=|first=|date=February 1, 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref> A ''[[Forbes]]'' editorial pointed out that [[Steven Mnuchin]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]], was a board member of Sears Holding until 2016, and is presently one of three directors of the [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]], which manages administration of pensions for defunct or bankrupt businesses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2019/06/03/the-shameless-sears-world-of-eddie-lampert-continues/#296430171fd6/|title=The Shameless Sears World Of Eddie Lampert Continues|last=|first=|date=June 3, 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"50\">\nFile:Sears, Robuck & Co. letterhead 1907.jpg|Letterhead logo 1907\nFile:Sears logo 1966-1984.svg|Logo 1963\u201384\nFile:Sears1984.png|1984\u201394\nFile:Sears logo 1994-2004.svg|1994\u20132004 (still used in [[Sears Mexico|Mexico]])\nFile:SearsLogo.svg|2004\u201310 (2004\u201316 in Canada)\nFile:Sears logo 2010-present.svg|2010\u201320\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Sears Auto Center.jpg|Sears Auto Center at [[Steeplegate Mall]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]].

Sears purchased them, then sold them at a low price to the station agents and made a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it \"R.W. Sears Watch Company.\" Within the first year, he met Alvah C. Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago; later that year, the R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. \n[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|170px|Julius Rosenwald]]\nIn 1889 Sears sold his business for [[US$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.1|1889|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-W-Sears|title=Richard W. Sears \u2013 American merchant |website=britannica.com}}</ref> Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to '''Sears, Roebuck & Company''' and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. \n\nBefore the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies\u2014often at high prices and on credit\u2014from local [[general store]]s with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated, and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. \n\nBy 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items such as sewing machines, bicycles, [[sports equipment|sporting goods]], automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by [[Lincoln Motor Car Works]] of Chicago, no relation to the current [[Lincoln (automobile)|Ford line]]).<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90.</ref> By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.4|1893|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.75|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) two years later.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/history1890s.htm \"Sears History \u2013 1890s.\"] ''Sears''. Last updated September 27, 2004.</ref> By 1896, dolls, stoves, and groceries had been added to the catalog.\n\n[[File:Sears Merchandise Building Tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The exterior of the [[Sears Merchandise Building Tower]]]]\nDespite the strong and growing sales, the national [[Panic of 1893]] led to a full-scale [[recession]], causing a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise by 1895. Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman [[Aaron Nusbaum]], who in turn brought in his brother-in-law [[Julius Rosenwald]], to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.075|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.15|1895|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by [[Albert Henry Loeb]] of Chicago law firm Loeb & Adler (now [[Arnstein & Lehr, LLP]]). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.<ref>Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years (2013).</ref>\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903 (${{Inflation|US|1.3|1903|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 47\u201353</ref> Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.\n\nIn September 1904, a freight elevator carrying 10 people fell three stories at a Sears store in Chicago, killing two people and seriously injuring six others. The freight elevator was being used because the passenger elevator was out of service for repairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Killed And Six Injured in Accident In Chicago Store |publisher=[[Indiana Democrat]] |date=7 September 1904 |url=http://www.gendisasters.com/illinois/15491/chicago-il-elevator-accident-sep-1904}}</ref>\n\nSales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million (${{Inflation|US|0.04|1906|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). They had to incorporate a new company in order to bring the operation public; Sears and Rosenwald established '''Sears, Roebuck and Company''' with the legal name '''Sears, Roebuck and Co.''', in the state of New York, which effectively replaced the original company.<ref>https://cepi.io/companies/sears-roebuck-and-co-/us_ny/27644 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042417/https://cepi.io/companies/sears-roebuck-and-co-/us_ny/27644 |date=December 1, 2017}} Sears, Roebuck and Company (Co.) 1906 New York incorporation</ref> The current company inherits the history of the old company, celebrating the original 1892 incorporation, rather than the 1906 revision, as the start of the company.\n\nSears' successful 1906 [[initial public offering]] (IPO) marks the first major retail IPO in American financial history and represented a coming of age, financially, of the consumer sector.<ref>Gregory D.

The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973, when the [[Sears Tower]] was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million (${{Inflation|US|0.050|1907|r=1|fmt=c}} billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.<ref>Emmet and Jeuck, ''Catalogues and Counters'' (1950) pp 53\u201357</ref>\n\nThe company was badly hurt during [[Post\u2013World War I recession|1919\u201321 as a severe depression]] hit the nation's farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings.

Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.<ref>Peter M. Ascoli, ''Julius Rosenwald: The Man Who Built Sears, Roebuck and Advanced the Cause of Black Education in the American South'', (2006).</ref>\n\nIn 1933 Sears issued the first of its Christmas catalogs known as the \"[[Sears Wishbook]]\", a catalog featuring toys and gifts, separate from the annual Christmas Catalog.

Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in [[Robert E. Wood]] to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail-order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It de-emphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists\u2014set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.<ref>Richard Longstreth, \"Sears, Roebuck and the Remaking of the Department Store, 1924\u201342,\" ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' (2006) 65#2 pp 238\u2013279</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the US, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing [[central business district]]s), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the [[Homart Development Company]] for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating [[Allstate|Allstate Insurance Company]] in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934. Over the decades it established major national brands, such as [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]], [[Diehard (type of battery)|DieHard]], [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]], [[Supertone Records|Supertone]], and [[Toughskins]]. The company became a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] during the mid-20th century, adding [[Dean Witter]] and [[Coldwell Banker]] real estate in 1981, starting [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] as a joint venture with [[IBM]] in 1984, and introducing the [[Discover Card|Discover credit card]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, Sears completed the 110-story [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] in Chicago, which became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|world's tallest building]], a title it took from the former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York.

In March 2009 London-based insurer [[Willis Group Holdings|Willis Group Holdings, Ltd.]], was given the building's naming rights to encourage them to occupy the building. The official renaming as the ''Willis Tower'' took place on Thursday, July 16, 2009, during a public ceremony hosted by Willis Group Holdings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE52B54J20090312 |title=Tallest U.S. building to get new name |work=Reuters |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Conlon}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, the company began divesting itself of many non-retail entities, which were detrimental to the company's bottom line. Sears spun off its financial services arm which included brokerage business Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card.

Katz, ''The Big Store'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe cost of distributing the once highly influential general merchandise catalog became prohibitive; sales and profits had declined. The company discontinued the catalog in 1993. It dismissed 50,000 workers who had filled the orders. This was before the internet became an effective tool. With the advantage of hindsight, the timing was poor; Sears already had in place what it took [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] years to achieve.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nSears eventually held sales on all items. The dedicated customer would just wait until the item was on sale to buy. In the meantime, the item took up valuable floor space. This was a marketing policy misjudgment.<ref name=wsj/>\n\nAfter weeks of speculation in 1998, Sears announced it had sold the remnants of Western Auto to [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]-based [[Advance Auto Parts]]. The business deal was not quite what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected. Specifically in return, Sears Roebuck became \"one of the largest shareholders\" after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto's wholesale and retail operations.

However, Riggs failed to qualify for the event.\nIn 2016, Craftsman became the title sponsor of the World Racing Group, World of Outlaws Sprint car racing series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woosprint.com/sponsors|title=World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series \u2013 Sponsors|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Employee relations==\n[[File:Sears Centro Historico.jpg|thumb|Sears building in the [[Edificio La Nacional]] building in Mexico City, across from the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].]]\nSears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done \"to be successful in this highly competitive environment\".<ref>\"600-plus Sears jobs to be cut\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 13, 1992</ref>\n\nIn early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of \"base items\" from the electronic department was cut to 1%.

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word ''plandovati'' used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means ''odmarati'', and in English means ''to rest''.\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century, the Hungarian empire started its reign, and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In the 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two-thirds of Hungary, including Banat.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th-century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* ''Pervan'' is Serbian and means ''first'', which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker does not tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it is nothing more than a guess: in German it is common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Hungarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happened to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787){{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs, Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also, the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got its present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word \"plandovati\" used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means \"odmarati\", and in English means \"to rest\".\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century the Hungarian empire started it's career and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two thirds of Hungary, including Banat.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* Pervan is serbian and means first, which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker doesnt't tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it's nothing more than a guess: in German it's common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Huangarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happend to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787){{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got it's present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].
