[[Brahmi]] legend \"NITI\" in front, [[Shrivatasa]] symbol on the reverse. 8th century CE.]]\n\nThe history of the region of [[Arakan]] (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into the [[Dhanyawadi]], [[Waithali]], [[Laymro]] and [[Mrauk U]]. Mrauk U was conquered by the [[Konbaung dynasty]] of Burma in 1784\u201385, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongside [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]]) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part of the new federal republic.\n\n===Independent kingdom===\nBased on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Arakan |volume=2 |page=315}}</ref> down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory as including, in varying points of time, the regions of [[Inwa|Ava]], the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], the port town of [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAccording to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom, centred around the northern town of [[Dhanyawadi]], arose in the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famed [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple|Mahamuni Buddha image]] was cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains than its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter its partial dominance by the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], the final [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] was founded in 1429 by [[Min Saw Mon]]. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Part of it, along [[Bengal Subah]]'s [[Chittagong]], was later conquered by the Islamic Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. \nThe country steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakan.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name=\"Phayre1841\">{{cite book|author=Arthur P.

The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the First [[Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824\u201326). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by the [[British Army]] and awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in [[British East India Company]]'s 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a temple at village Nadrai near [[Kasganj]] town in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of [[Uttar Pradesh]] India. In the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] (1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongside [[Tanintharyi]] (Tenasserim) to [[British India]]. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period.\n\n===1940 onwards and inclusion in Myanmar===\n\nRakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u201343]] and the [[Battle of Ramree Island]]. In 1948, Arakan became part of the newly independent [[Union of Burma]] (later renamed as [[Myanmar]]) and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement for [[secession]] and restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under General [[Ne Win]] constituted \"Rakhine State\" from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of the [[Rakhine people]].\n\n===2010 onwards (after 2008 constitution)===\nSince 2010, Rakhine state has had two chief ministers: Hla Maung Tin and Major General Maung Maung Ohn.\nHla Maung Tin ( January 2011 \u2013 20 June 2014) was an elected Rakhine [[State and Region Hluttaws|State Hluttaw]] member representing USDP from [[Ann Township]] in 2010 general election.  He resigned from the post after recurrent intense inter-communal conflicts between Muslims and Rakhine ethnic groups in 2012\u201314.<ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621065601/http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns |date=21 June 2014 }}</ref>\nIn 2014, he was replaced by Major General Maung Maung Ohn (30 June 2014 \u2013 present).

[[Brahmi]] legend \"NITI\" in front, [[Shrivatasa]] symbol on the reverse. 8th century CE.]]\n\nThe history of the region of [[Arakan]] (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into the [[Dhanyawadi]], [[Waithali]], [[Laymro]] and [[Mrauk U]]. Mrauk U was conquered by the [[Konbaung dynasty]] of Burma in 1784\u201385, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongside [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]]) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part of the new federal republic.\n\n===Independent kingdom===\nBased on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Arakan |volume=2 |page=315}}</ref> down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory as including, in varying points of time, the regions of [[Inwa|Ava]], the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], the port town of [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAccording to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom, centred around the northern town of [[Dhanyawadi]], arose in the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famed [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple|Mahamuni Buddha image]] was cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains than its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter its partial dominance by the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], the final [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] was founded in 1429 by [[Min Saw Mon]]. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Part of it, along [[Bengal Subah]]'s [[Chittagong]], was later conquered by the Islamic Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. \nThe country steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakans.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name=\"Phayre1841\">{{cite book|author=Arthur P.

The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the First [[Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824\u201326). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by the [[British Army]] and awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in [[British East India Company]]'s 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a temple at village Nadrai near [[Kasganj]] town in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of [[Uttar Pradesh]] India. In the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] (1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongside [[Tanintharyi]] (Tenasserim) to [[British India]]. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period.\n\n===1940 onwards and inclusion in Myanmar===\n\nRakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u201343]] and the [[Battle of Ramree Island]]. In 1948, Arakan became part of the newly independent [[Union of Burma]] (later renamed as [[Myanmar]]) and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement for [[secession]] and restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under General [[Ne Win]] constituted \"Rakhine State\" from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of the [[Rakhine people]].\n\n===2010 onwards (after 2008 constitution)===\nSince 2010, Rakhine state has had two chief ministers: Hla Maung Tin and Major General Maung Maung Ohn.\nHla Maung Tin ( January 2011 \u2013 20 June 2014) was an elected Rakhine [[State and Region Hluttaws|State Hluttaw]] member representing USDP from [[Ann Township]] in 2010 general election.  He resigned from the post after recurrent intense inter-communal conflicts between Muslims and Rakhine ethnic groups in 2012\u201314.<ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621065601/http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns |date=21 June 2014 }}</ref>\nIn 2014, he was replaced by Major General Maung Maung Ohn (30 June 2014 \u2013 present).
