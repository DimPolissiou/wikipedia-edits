As the [[gorilla]] named [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], the player explores the themed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] of an island to collect items and rescue [[List of Donkey Kong characters|his kidnapped friends]] from [[King K. Rool]]. The player completes [[minigames]] and puzzles as five playable Kong characters\u2014each with its own special abilities\u2014to receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, up to four players can compete in [[deathmatch]] and [[last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] games.\n\nRare, which had previously developed the ''[[Donkey Kong Country (series)|Donkey Kong Country]]'' games, began development in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare's ''[[Banjo-Tooie|Banjo]]'' group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by [[Nintendo]] in North America in November and worldwide in December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console's [[Expansion Pak]], an accessory that added [[random access memory|memory]] resources. The game's exceptionally large marketing budget included advertisements, [[Sweepstake|sweepstakes]], and a national tour.\n\nThe game received universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo's top seller during the 1999 [[holiday season]], with 2.3&nbsp;million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 [[Game Critics Awards|E3 Game Critics award]] for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game's exceptional size and length, but criticized its camera controls and emphasis on item collection and backtracking. Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare's 1998 predecessor, ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', despite ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} mandatory memory add-on. Critics felt that the game did not meet the revolutionary potential of ''Donkey Kong Country'', but remained among the best 3D platform games on the console.\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' is remembered as the emblematic example of Rare's \"collect-a-thon\" adventure platformers for the tedium of its collection tasks. ''Donkey Kong 64'' was later released on Nintendo's [[Wii U Virtual Console]] in 2015.\n\nHis coconut gun can fire in spurts\nIf he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n[[File:dk64 jungle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], the player-controlled character, runs towards an enemy in the game's jungle-themed world|alt=A brown gorilla runs across a green expanse of blurry green. A palm tree grows in the back right corner and a dark jungle background shows in the distance.]]\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' is a 3D [[platform game|platforming]] [[adventure game]] in which the player, as [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] and [[List of Donkey Kong characters|his friends]], explores an island and collects items to progress through [[minigame]]s and puzzles.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev}} The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: [[King K. Rool]] and his reptilian [[Kremlings]] invade the idyllic DK Isle and kidnap Donkey Kong's friends, planning to power up their Blast-O-Matic weapon and destroy the island.{{r|GSpot rev|NL: Wii U rev}} After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue the others from their kidnappers and stop K. Rool's plan.{{r|IGN rev}} While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects two types of bananas: normal bananas, which are colored differently for each Kong character, award the player with banana medals and can be traded for access to each world's [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]]; and golden bananas, a certain number of which are required to unlock each new in-game world.{{r|NL: Wii U rev}} Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game [[Concentration (game)|Concentration]]. Minigames include races, [[minecart]] rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as [[Projectile|projectiles]]. There are five such golden banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across seven themed worlds{{emdash}}200 goals in total, in addition to a connecting [[overworld]].{{r|IGN rev}}{{refn|Each world follows a theme, such as underwater, forest, jungle, and industry.{{r|GSpot rev|NL: Wii U rev}}}} Unlike in prior ''Donkey Kong'' games, the objectives can be completed in any order.{{r|NG preview|NL: Wii U rev}} The player can [[fast travel]] between sections of the [[Level (video gaming)|level]] with designated warp pads and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels.{{r|N46 mag rev|GamePro}} The player also collects banana coins, which can be spent to unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces.<!--if needed: http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/23/the-secrets-of-donkey-kong-64--> As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.{{r|IGN rev}}\n\nDonkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable characters after the player rescues them.{{r|Next Gen rev}} Each of the five characters begin with basic abilities and can purchase additional, unique abilities from [[Cranky Kong]] as the game progresses, which are necessary to solve certain puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can operate levers, [[Chunky Kong]] can lift rocks, [[Tiny Kong]] can crawl through holes, [[Diddy Kong]] can fly, and [[Lanky Kong]] can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can be opened only with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can be opened only with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities. Combinations also trigger special modes, including alternative camera angles, a sniper mode, and a snapshot mode which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable versions of the 1981 ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and 1983 ''[[Jetpac]]'' are hidden within the game, and playing through them is required to finish the story.{{r|IGN rev}}<!-- The player-character can also transform into animals, such as [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Animal buddies|Rambi the rhino and Enguarde the swordfish]], who recur from earlier series games.{{r|AllGame rev}}--> Optional hardware support includes a [[widescreen]] mode{{r|GSpot rev}} and [[Rumble Pak]] compatibility.{{r|AllGame overview}}\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' features a separate multiplayer mode with six{{r|NP rev}} minigames for two to four players.{{r|GSpot rev}} Monkey Smash is an open arena, [[deathmatch]]-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all their own [[Health (gaming)|lives]]. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other off the edge of a platform.{{r|IGN rev}} Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.{{r|AllGame overview}}\n\n== Development ==\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Nintendo-64-Memory-Expansion-Pak.jpg\n| alt1 = Front and back views of a black, plastic cartridge with a red top.\n| image2 = Jungle green Nintendo 64 (10448842084).jpg\n| alt2 = A translucent green Nintendo 64 console with four controller ports in its front.\n| footer = ''Donkey Kong 64'' was the first game to require the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak ''(pictured)'', a memory upgrade.

The Nintendo 64 was still new to Rare, and at the time they did not have a common game engine. The linear version was developed for around 18 months. While 3D graphics prevented Rare from reproducing the detailed [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] graphics of the ''Donkey Kong Country'' series, they allowed the company to make characters more expressive. {{r|DF Retro}}\n\nOne of the big challenges in the switch to 3D was making the player models look good. Lead artist Mark Stevenson noted that  \"Being able to see this character from any angle, you'd make an animation, put it in the game, and you'd think it looked good side-on, but awful from every other angle! It was challenging from a technical and design perspective.\"<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\"/> Stevenson also noted that as 3D gaming was in its infancy, the real-time models they created were always going to look worse than the [[pre-rendered]] graphics of the previous games in the series.<ref name=\"Nintedolife\"/> The models from the ''Country'' games were used as reference points although owing to the graphics being built on different hardware their use beyond this was limited.<ref name=\"Nintedolife\"/>\n\nThe game was noted for its high number of collectibles, containing 3,821 in total.<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\"/>  This was at the request of Rare founder [[Tim Stamper]] who requested early on that there be \"lots to collect\" to help differentiate the game from ''Banjo-Kazooie''. According to creative director George Andres, \"I'd always go back to him and say 'Here's some' and he'd go 'No, more things'.\" Andres would later note that he should have \"Scaled things down\", pointing out that he would have, among other things, liked to unify the banana system.<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\">{{cite web |last1=Power |first1=Tom |title=As Donkey Kong 64 turns 20, the devs reflect on its design, the infamous DK Rap, and how a shocked Shigeru Miyamoto created the Coconut Shooter |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/making-of-donkey-kong-64/ |website=Games Radar |accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref>  The game also attempted to differentiate itself from ''Banjo-Kazooie'' through the use  of \"thrilling moments\" and \"over the top Boss battles.\"<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\"/>\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' was the first of two games{{r|CVG: rap}} to require the Nintendo 64's [[Expansion Pak]], a console [[Computer memory|memory]] upgrade that shipped with the game.{{r|GSpot rev}} The upgrade was previously used to power optional, high-resolution textures, but in the case of ''Donkey Kong 64'', it was marketed as improving the game's frame rate and rendering of objects at a distance.{{r|IGN: Enforces}} According to Rare programmer Chris Marlow, the company could not resolve a bug that occurred without the Expansion Pak and thus they were forced, at great expense, to bundle the game with the memory upgrade.{{r|Expansion Pak}}  However, Mark Stevenson has called this a \"myth\" and noted that the decision to use the Expansion Pak was made early on in development. He confirmed the presence of such a bug near the end of development but noted that \"the Expansion Pak wasn\u2019t introduced to deal with this and wasn\u2019t the solution to the problem.\"<ref name=\"Nintedolife\">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=Gavin |title=Feature: Donkey Kong 64 Devs On Bugs, Boxing And 20 Years Of The DK Rap |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_donkey_kong_64_devs_on_bugs_boxing_and_20_years_of_the_dk_rap |website=Nintendo Life}}</ref> Nintendo said that the choice to bundle, rather than selling the accessory separately, would avoid consumer confusion.{{r|IGN: Absolute}}\n\n[[File:Grant Kirkhope.png|thumb|left|upright=.7|Composer Grant Kirkhope|alt=A blue duotone headshot photo of a white man with a short haircut in T-shirt]]\n\n[[Grant Kirkhope]] composed the game's soundtrack, bringing it closer to the tradition of ''Banjo-Kazooie'' than to that of [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]]'s ''Donkey Kong Country'' soundtracks.{{r|NL: N64 rev}} The \"[[DK Rap]]\", which introduces the Kong character abilities at its outset, was conceived and written by George Andreas, scored and recorded by Kirkhope, and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland.{{r|Rare Breed|Edge: Rare Vintage}} It was designed to be lighthearted despite being interpreted as a \"serious\" songwriting attempt at the game's launch.{{r|Rare Breed|SEMO}} Nintendo of America ran a \"DK Rap\" contest in which fans record their own version of the rap to win prizes including a trip to the company's [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] headquarters.{{r|IGN: Chatter}}\n\nRare announced ''Donkey Kong 64'' with a single screenshot on its website{{r|N46 mag rev}} and coverage in the January 1999 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.{{r|IGN: Miss Us}} ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' wrote that the title was playable by the [[E3 1997|1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo]],{{r|EGM preview}} though ''[[IGN]]'' said that it debuted at [[E3 1999|the 1999 event]].<!--more citations, if needed: {{r|IGN: Stellar|IGN: 99}}-->{{r|IGN: Eye}} The game also demoed at Nintendo's 1999 [[Nintendo Space World|Spaceworld]].{{r|IGN: Spaceworld}} ''Donkey Kong 64'' was expected to be a bestseller, as the console's \"crowning achievement\" in graphics and sound.{{r|IGN: Stellar|IGN: 99}}\n\n''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} sizable {{usd|22&nbsp;million}} marketing campaign doubled the typical budget for a major Nintendo release. The campaign included a 60-second commercial played at over 10,000 movie theaters during the holiday season, and additional advertisements shown on billboards, in print, and over radio.{{r|EGM preview}} A promotional \"The Beast Is Back\" tour brought a truck outfitted with Nintendo games across the United States,{{r|IGN: Beast}} and a separate sweepstakes between the series and [[Dr. Pepper]] soda advertised in [[supermarkets]]. Nintendo sought to sell four million copies of the game (1.5&nbsp;million more than for ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''), including a million of the translucent green Nintendo 64 bundles.{{r|EGM preview}}{{refn|Earlier in the year, Nintendo projected the game to sell 2.5 million copies within a year.{{r|IGN: Enforces}}}} Polled retailers expected ''Donkey Kong 64'' to be the

and Nintendo's chief defense against competitor [[Sega]]'s introduction of its [[Dreamcast]] console.{{r|IGN: Dominates}} As a bestseller, ''Donkey Kong 64'' joined Nintendo's \"[[Player's Choice]]\" game selection, where it continued to sell well through the next year's holiday season.{{r|IGN: Player's Choice}} By 2004, ''Donkey Kong 64'' had sold over 2.3&nbsp;million units in North America.{{r|GD 2005}} It won the 1999 [[Game Critics Awards|E3 Game Critics award]] for Best Platform Game,{{r|RG 43}} and several annual awards from ''Nintendo Power'', including best overall game of 1999.{{r|IGN: NP awards|NP 132}} It was additionally nominated for Game of the Year and Console Game of the Year in the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]]' 2000 [[Interactive Achievement Awards]].{{r|AIAS}} ''[[GamePro]]'' named it an \"Editor's Choice\".{{r|GamePro}} ''IGN'' described ''Donkey Kong 64'' as the biggest and most ambitious title on the Nintendo 64 as of its release, but very similar to ''Banjo-Kazooie'' in its platforming and puzzle design.{{r|IGN rev}} Similarities between the two games and their themes was a common refrain among reviewers.{{r|N46 mag rev|Next Gen rev}}<!-- Overall, reviewers were more impressed by its visuals than by its other elements, such as gameplay.{{r|EGM rev|IGN rev}}-->\n\n<!-- COLLECTING -->Reviewers criticized or had little praise for the game's emphasis on collecting items and backtracking{{r|CVG: rap}}{{refn|Reviewers who commented on item collection and backtracking include ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'',{{r|EGM rev}} ''GameSpot'',{{r|GSpot rev}} ''GameFan'',{{r|GameFan rev}} ''N64 Magazine'',{{r|NL: N64 rev}} ''Nintendo Life'',{{r|NL: Wii U rev}} ''Next Generation'',{{r|Next Gen rev}} ''Daily Radar'',{{r|Daily Radar}} and ''AllGame''.{{r|AllGame rev}}}}{{emdash}}\"an interactive [[egg hunt]]\".{{r|Next Gen rev}} This had become a trend in the developer's games, and ''Donkey Kong 64'' followed the \"predictable formula\" of making players collect multiple sets of items and in full for a special ending.{{r|EGM rev}} ''Next Generation'' also saw the developer creating a habit of backtracking in their games.{{r|Next Gen rev}} ''[[GameSpot]]'' was more diplomatic: those who liked collecting items would be titillated by its [[replay value]], and those who did not would be frustrated by its chores.{{r|GSpot rev}} The puzzles and minigames are fun the first time through, according to ''EGM'', but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions.{{r|EGM rev}} ''GameSpot'', however, considered parts of ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} gameplay \"cerebral\", requiring the player to consider several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles.{{r|GSpot rev}} Already familiar with the game's concepts borrowed from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Banjo-Kazooie'', reviewers considered the player's tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher.{{r|AllGame rev|IGN rev}} In retrospective reviews, ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' described the chore of collecting objects \"excessive\" and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.{{r|NL: Wii U rev|NL: N64 rev}}\n\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->Reviewers noted the game's size and length.{{r|N46 mag rev|IGN rev|NP rev|GamePro|Next Gen rev|NL: N64 rev}} With an estimated 30 hours in basic gameplay,{{r|EGM preview|N46 mag rev|NL: Wii U rev}} ''IGN'' called it Rare's ''[[War and Peace]]''.{{r|IGN rev}} \"Big\" is an understatement, wrote ''[[GameFan]]'', \"the adventure found within is mastodonic\".{{r|GameFan rev}} Reviewers became frequently lost or distracted in its world.{{r|AllGame rev|EGM rev}} Reviewers highlighted the ingenuity of the boss battles, particularly the final battle against K. Rool,{{r|N46 mag rev|EGM rev}} although the story's ending disappointed ''EGM''.{{r|EGM rev}} Reviewers found little entertainment in the multiplayer mode but praised the gameplay variety between the five characters.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev}} The controls also frustrated reviewers, between slow movement speed and camera angle issues.{{r|AllGame rev|N46 mag rev|GSpot rev|NP rev|EGM rev}} For example, characters who become unresponsive to control during their attack animations are vulnerable to encroaching enemies.{{r|EGM rev}} ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' wrote that the lack of camera improvements over ''Banjo-Kazooie'' was inexcusable.{{r|Edge rev}}\n\n<!-- GRAPHICS -->Despite its expanded memory resources, reviewers felt that ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} visuals were only marginally{{emdash}}if at all{{emdash}}better than that of its contemporary games, such as the previous year's ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''.{{r|AllGame rev|GSpot rev|IGN rev|EGM rev}} In fact, ''[[IGN]]'' avowed that ''Donkey Kong 64'' was not as pretty as ''Banjo-Kazooie'', especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. ''IGN'' hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered its dynamic lighting overused.{{r|IGN rev}} ''[[N64 Magazine]]'' said the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths.{{r|N46 mag rev}} Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev}} ''[[GameSpot]]'' also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.{{r|GSpot rev}}\n\nThe characters have Rare's emblematic humor, and reviewers praised their individual personalities.{{r|AllGame rev|NL: N64 rev|GameFan rev}} Several reviewers noted the degree to which the character personalities showed in their animations.{{r|IGN rev|GamePro|GameFan rev}} ''IGN'' considered ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} characters less baffling than those of other Rare titles, and sometimes funny.{{r|IGN rev}} ''GameFan'' found that the addition of the three new playable characters to the series offered little personality that would be missed.{{r|GameFan rev}}\n\n<!-- SOUND -->While ''IGN'' felt that the game's music was less clever than ''Banjo-Kazooie''{{'s}}, Kirkhope's soundtrack still delivered a variety of moods{{r|IGN rev}} and fit the setting.{{r|NL: Wii U rev}} Aural clues in the surround sound and the quality of the underwater effects impressed ''GameSpot''.{{r|GSpot rev}} Reviewers criticized the opening \"DK Rap\"{{r|CVG: rap}} as \"embarrassing\"{{r|N46 mag rev}} and among the worst music to feature in a game.{{r|IGN rev}} ''GamePro'', however, thought it was humorous albeit lowbrow.{{r|GamePro}} Eight years later, ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' said the song was \"loved by some, loathed by others\", similar to the game itself.{{r|NL: N64 rev}}\n\n<!-- CONCLUSION -->Reviewers concluded that ''Donkey Kong 64'' lacked the revolutionary potential of ''Donkey Kong Country'' but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev|EGM rev}} \"The 3D platform genre doesn't evolve with ''Donkey Kong 64'',\" ''AllGame'' wrote.{{r|AllGame rev}} While hyped fans would be disappointed, ''IGN'' felt that ''Donkey Kong 64'' remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount of things to do.{{r|IGN rev}} ''GameFan'', on the other hand, was most disappointed by how the game \"truly offers nothing new\" and compared its monotony and repetition with the film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'': \"a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness{{nbsp}}... [of] sitting through the whole thing\", it \"fails to live up to the Rare name\".{{r|GameFan rev}} ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to ''GameSpot'', would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 [[launch title]].{{r|GSpot rev}} With its competition considered, ''[[Daily Radar]]'' wrote that ''Donkey Kong 64'' was simply the best 3D platform game on the console.{{r|Daily Radar}} ''Edge'' qualified this thought: ''Donkey Kong 64'' was the closest any third-party developer had come to outdoing Nintendo's mastery of game structure, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo's ''Super Mario 64''. Nevertheless, the 3D ''Donkey Kong'' was \"a fine effort{{nbsp}}... in its own right\".{{r|Edge rev}}\n<!--\nIn a retrospective review, ''Nintendo Life'' found the Wii U controller an easy substitute for the Nintendo 64's controls.{{r|NL: Wii U rev}}\n-->\n\n== Legacy ==\nAlthough they received critical acclaim from critics and players, Rare's 3D platformers became notorious for their emphasis on collecting items, and ''[[Kotaku]]'' remembered ''Donkey Kong 64'' as \"the worst offender\" with hundreds of color-coded bananas.{{r|Kotaku: Yooka}} Other retrospective reviewers agreed.{{r|USgamer: Best|Kotaku: Mockery|Complex: worst}} \"As{{nbsp}}... ''Super Mario 64'' breathed life into the 3D platforming genre\", ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote, \"''Donkey Kong 64'' sucked it all out\" and solidified Rare's reputation for making \"collect-a-thon\" games.{{r|EGM 2005}} The indie developer behind ''[[A Hat in Time]]'', a spiritual successor to ''Banjo-Kazooie'', blamed ''Donkey Kong 64'' for the \"collect-a-thon platform adventurer\" genre's decline in popularity.{{r|NL: Hat|Polygon: Hat}}\n\n''Retro Gamer'' and ''Game Informer'' both remembered the game's reception as \"mixed\",{{r|RG 43|GI: Replay}} in consideration of its similarities with ''Banjo-Kazooie'' and lack of genre-pushing changes.{{r|RG 43}} Despite decent reviews, ''Donkey Kong 64'' and Rare's subsequent Nintendo 64 releases did not meet the extolment of the company's preceding games, and lackluster sales led to a staff exodus that culminated with the company's acquisition by [[Microsoft]] in 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Rare\">{{Cite web|last1=McLaughlin |first1=Rus |title=IGN Presents the History of Rare |work=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2008 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/28/ign-presents-the-history-of-rare?page=5 |pages=5\u20136 |accessdate=May 30, 2017 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529042610/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/28/ign-presents-the-history-of-rare?page=5 |archivedate=May 29, 2016 }}</ref> The Nintendo 64 was approaching the end of its lifecycle, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' noted at the game's launch, as gamers turned their sights to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony [[PlayStation 2]].{{r|EGM preview}} ''IGN'' later named ''Donkey Kong 64'' as worthy of being remade for Nintendo's [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS handheld console]].{{r|IGN: 3DS remake}}\n\nThe \"DK Rap\" is remembered for its negative reception.{{r|DK Rap}} Renditions of the song later appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

As the [[gorilla]] named [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], the player explores the themed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] of an island to collect items and rescue [[List of Donkey Kong characters|his kidnapped friends]] from [[King K. Rool]]. The player completes [[minigames]] and puzzles as five playable Kong characters\u2014each with its own special abilities\u2014to receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, up to four players can compete in [[deathmatch]] and [[last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] games.\n\nRare, which had previously developed the ''[[Donkey Kong Country (series)|Donkey Kong Country]]'' games, began development in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare's ''[[Banjo-Tooie|Banjo]]'' group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by [[Nintendo]] in North America in November and worldwide in December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console's [[Expansion Pak]], an accessory that added [[random access memory|memory]] resources. The game's exceptionally large marketing budget included advertisements, [[Sweepstake|sweepstakes]], and a national tour.\n\nThe game received universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo's top seller during the 1999 [[holiday season]], with 2.3&nbsp;million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 [[Game Critics Awards|E3 Game Critics award]] for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game's exceptional size and length, but criticized its camera controls and emphasis on item collection and backtracking. Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare's 1998 predecessor, ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', despite ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} mandatory memory add-on. Critics felt that the game did not meet the revolutionary potential of ''Donkey Kong Country'', but remained among the best 3D platform games on the console.\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' is remembered as the emblematic example of Rare's \"collect-a-thon\" adventure platformers for the tedium of its collection tasks. ''Donkey Kong 64'' was later released on Nintendo's [[Wii U Virtual Console]] in 2015.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n[[File:dk64 jungle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], the player-controlled character, runs towards an enemy in the game's jungle-themed world|alt=A brown gorilla runs across a green expanse of blurry green. A palm tree grows in the back right corner and a dark jungle background shows in the distance.]]\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' is a 3D [[platform game|platforming]] [[adventure game]] in which the player, as [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] and [[List of Donkey Kong characters|his friends]], explores an island and collects items to progress through [[minigame]]s and puzzles.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev}} The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: [[King K. Rool]] and his reptilian [[Kremlings]] invade the idyllic DK Isle and kidnap Donkey Kong's friends, planning to power up their Blast-O-Matic weapon and destroy the island.{{r|GSpot rev|NL: Wii U rev}} After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue the others from their kidnappers and stop K. Rool's plan.{{r|IGN rev}} While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects two types of bananas: normal bananas, which are colored differently for each Kong character, award the player with banana medals and can be traded for access to each world's [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]]; and golden bananas, a certain number of which are required to unlock each new in-game world.{{r|NL: Wii U rev}} Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game [[Concentration (game)|Concentration]]. Minigames include races, [[minecart]] rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as [[Projectile|projectiles]]. There are five such golden banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across seven themed worlds{{emdash}}200 goals in total, in addition to a connecting [[overworld]].{{r|IGN rev}}{{refn|Each world follows a theme, such as underwater, forest, jungle, and industry.{{r|GSpot rev|NL: Wii U rev}}}} Unlike in prior ''Donkey Kong'' games, the objectives can be completed in any order.{{r|NG preview|NL: Wii U rev}} The player can [[fast travel]] between sections of the [[Level (video gaming)|level]] with designated warp pads and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels.{{r|N46 mag rev|GamePro}} The player also collects banana coins, which can be spent to unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces.<!--if needed: http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/23/the-secrets-of-donkey-kong-64--> As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.{{r|IGN rev}}\n\nDonkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable characters after the player rescues them.{{r|Next Gen rev}} Each of the five characters begin with basic abilities and can purchase additional, unique abilities from [[Cranky Kong]] as the game progresses, which are necessary to solve certain puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can operate levers, [[Chunky Kong]] can lift rocks, [[Tiny Kong]] can crawl through holes, [[Diddy Kong]] can fly, and [[Lanky Kong]] can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can be opened only with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can be opened only with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities. Combinations also trigger special modes, including alternative camera angles, a sniper mode, and a snapshot mode which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable versions of the 1981 ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and 1983 ''[[Jetpac]]'' are hidden within the game, and playing through them is required to finish the story.{{r|IGN rev}}<!-- The player-character can also transform into animals, such as [[List of Donkey Kong characters#Animal buddies|Rambi the rhino and Enguarde the swordfish]], who recur from earlier series games.{{r|AllGame rev}}--> Optional hardware support includes a [[widescreen]] mode{{r|GSpot rev}} and [[Rumble Pak]] compatibility.{{r|AllGame overview}}\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' features a separate multiplayer mode with six{{r|NP rev}} minigames for two to four players.{{r|GSpot rev}} Monkey Smash is an open arena, [[deathmatch]]-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all their own [[Health (gaming)|lives]]. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other off the edge of a platform.{{r|IGN rev}} Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.{{r|AllGame overview}}\n\n== Development ==\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Nintendo-64-Memory-Expansion-Pak.jpg\n| alt1 = Front and back views of a black, plastic cartridge with a red top.\n| image2 = Jungle green Nintendo 64 (10448842084).jpg\n| alt2 = A translucent green Nintendo 64 console with four controller ports in its front.\n| footer = ''Donkey Kong 64'' was the first game to require the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak ''(pictured)'', a memory upgrade.

The Nintendo 64 was still new to Rare, and at the time they did not have a common game engine. The linear version was developed for around 18 months. While 3D graphics prevented Rare from reproducing the detailed [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] graphics of the ''Donkey Kong Country'' series, they allowed the company to make characters more expressive. {{r|DF Retro}}\n\nOne of the big challenges in the switch to 3D was making the player models look good. Lead artist Mark Stevenson noted that  \"Being able to see this character from any angle, you'd make an animation, put it in the game, and you'd think it looked good side-on, but awful from every other angle! It was challenging from a technical and design perspective.\"<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\"/> Stevenson also noted that as 3D gaming was in its infancy, the real-time models they created were always going to look worse than the [[pre-rendered]] graphics of the previous games in the series.<ref name=\"Nintedolife\"/> The models from the ''Country'' games were used as reference points although owing to the graphics being built on different hardware their use beyond this was limited.<ref name=\"Nintedolife\"/>\n\nThe game was noted for its high number of collectibles, containing 3,821 in total.<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\"/>  This was at the request of Rare founder [[Tim Stamper]] who requested early on that there be \"lots to collect\" to help differentiate the game from ''Banjo-Kazooie''. According to creative director George Andres, \"I'd always go back to him and say 'Here's some' and he'd go 'No, more things'.\" Andres would later note that he should have \"Scaled things down\", pointing out that he would have, among other things, liked to unify the banana system.<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\">{{cite web |last1=Power |first1=Tom |title=As Donkey Kong 64 turns 20, the devs reflect on its design, the infamous DK Rap, and how a shocked Shigeru Miyamoto created the Coconut Shooter |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/making-of-donkey-kong-64/ |website=Games Radar |accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref>  The game also attempted to differentiate itself from ''Banjo-Kazooie'' through the use  of \"thrilling moments\" and \"over the top Boss battles.\"<ref name=\"Gamesradarretrospective\"/>\n\n''Donkey Kong 64'' was the first of two games{{r|CVG: rap}} to require the Nintendo 64's [[Expansion Pak]], a console [[Computer memory|memory]] upgrade that shipped with the game.{{r|GSpot rev}} The upgrade was previously used to power optional, high-resolution textures, but in the case of ''Donkey Kong 64'', it was marketed as improving the game's frame rate and rendering of objects at a distance.{{r|IGN: Enforces}} According to Rare programmer Chris Marlow, the company could not resolve a bug that occurred without the Expansion Pak and thus they were forced, at great expense, to bundle the game with the memory upgrade.{{r|Expansion Pak}}  However, Mark Stevenson has called this a \"myth\" and noted that the decision to use the Expansion Pak was made early on in development. He confirmed the presence of such a bug near the end of development but noted that \"the Expansion Pak wasn\u2019t introduced to deal with this and wasn\u2019t the solution to the problem.\"<ref name=\"Nintedolife\">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=Gavin |title=Feature: Donkey Kong 64 Devs On Bugs, Boxing And 20 Years Of The DK Rap |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_donkey_kong_64_devs_on_bugs_boxing_and_20_years_of_the_dk_rap |website=Nintendo Life}}</ref> Nintendo said that the choice to bundle, rather than selling the accessory separately, would avoid consumer confusion.{{r|IGN: Absolute}}\n\n[[File:Grant Kirkhope.png|thumb|left|upright=.7|Composer Grant Kirkhope|alt=A blue duotone headshot photo of a white man with a short haircut in T-shirt]]\n\n[[Grant Kirkhope]] composed the game's soundtrack, bringing it closer to the tradition of ''Banjo-Kazooie'' than to that of [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]]'s ''Donkey Kong Country'' soundtracks.{{r|NL: N64 rev}} The \"[[DK Rap]]\", which introduces the Kong character abilities at its outset, was conceived and written by George Andreas, scored and recorded by Kirkhope, and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland.{{r|Rare Breed|Edge: Rare Vintage}} It was designed to be lighthearted despite being interpreted as a \"serious\" songwriting attempt at the game's launch.{{r|Rare Breed|SEMO}} Nintendo of America ran a \"DK Rap\" contest in which fans record their own version of the rap to win prizes including a trip to the company's [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] headquarters.{{r|IGN: Chatter}}\n\nRare announced ''Donkey Kong 64'' with a single screenshot on its website{{r|N46 mag rev}} and coverage in the January 1999 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.{{r|IGN: Miss Us}} ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' wrote that the title was playable by the [[E3 1997|1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo]],{{r|EGM preview}} though ''[[IGN]]'' said that it debuted at [[E3 1999|the 1999 event]].<!--more citations, if needed: {{r|IGN: Stellar|IGN: 99}}-->{{r|IGN: Eye}} The game also demoed at Nintendo's 1999 [[Nintendo Space World|Spaceworld]].{{r|IGN: Spaceworld}} ''Donkey Kong 64'' was expected to be a bestseller, as the console's \"crowning achievement\" in graphics and sound.{{r|IGN: Stellar|IGN: 99}}\n\n''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} sizable {{usd|22&nbsp;million}} marketing campaign doubled the typical budget for a major Nintendo release. The campaign included a 60-second commercial played at over 10,000 movie theaters during the holiday season, and additional advertisements shown on billboards, in print, and over radio.{{r|EGM preview}} A promotional \"The Beast Is Back\" tour brought a truck outfitted with Nintendo games across the United States,{{r|IGN: Beast}} and a separate sweepstakes between the series and [[Dr. Pepper]] soda advertised in [[supermarkets]]. Nintendo sought to sell four million copies of the game (1.5&nbsp;million more than for ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''), including a million of the translucent green Nintendo 64 bundles.{{r|EGM preview}}{{refn|Earlier in the year, Nintendo projected the game to sell 2.5 million copies within a year.{{r|IGN: Enforces}}}} Polled retailers expected ''Donkey Kong 64'' to be the top console game sold during the 1999 holiday season.{{r|IGN: Huge}} The title had little [[holiday season]] competition from Nintendo, who had moved its other releases including ''[[Mario Party 2]]'', ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'' into the next year.{{r|AllGame rev|EGM preview}}\n\nRare and Nintendo released the game in North America in November 1999,{{r|EGM preview|AllGame rev}} and a worldwide release followed the next month.{{r|N46 mag rev|Famitsu}} Accompanying the game's launch, Nintendo offered a special bundle of the game and console, including a

and Nintendo's chief defense against competitor [[Sega]]'s introduction of its [[Dreamcast]] console.{{r|IGN: Dominates}} As a bestseller, ''Donkey Kong 64'' joined Nintendo's \"[[Player's Choice]]\" game selection, where it continued to sell well through the next year's holiday season.{{r|IGN: Player's Choice}} By 2004, ''Donkey Kong 64'' had sold over 2.3&nbsp;million units in North America.{{r|GD 2005}} It won the 1999 [[Game Critics Awards|E3 Game Critics award]] for Best Platform Game,{{r|RG 43}} and several annual awards from ''Nintendo Power'', including best overall game of 1999.{{r|IGN: NP awards|NP 132}} It was additionally nominated for Game of the Year and Console Game of the Year in the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]]' 2000 [[Interactive Achievement Awards]].{{r|AIAS}} ''[[GamePro]]'' named it an \"Editor's Choice\".{{r|GamePro}} ''IGN'' described ''Donkey Kong 64'' as the biggest and most ambitious title on the Nintendo 64 as of its release, but very similar to ''Banjo-Kazooie'' in its platforming and puzzle design.{{r|IGN rev}} Similarities between the two games and their themes was a common refrain among reviewers.{{r|N46 mag rev|Next Gen rev}}<!-- Overall, reviewers were more impressed by its visuals than by its other elements, such as gameplay.{{r|EGM rev|IGN rev}}-->\n\n<!-- COLLECTING -->Reviewers criticized or had little praise for the game's emphasis on collecting items and backtracking{{r|CVG: rap}}{{refn|Reviewers who commented on item collection and backtracking include ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'',{{r|EGM rev}} ''GameSpot'',{{r|GSpot rev}} ''GameFan'',{{r|GameFan rev}} ''N64 Magazine'',{{r|NL: N64 rev}} ''Nintendo Life'',{{r|NL: Wii U rev}} ''Next Generation'',{{r|Next Gen rev}} ''Daily Radar'',{{r|Daily Radar}} and ''AllGame''.{{r|AllGame rev}}}}{{emdash}}\"an interactive [[egg hunt]]\".{{r|Next Gen rev}} This had become a trend in the developer's games, and ''Donkey Kong 64'' followed the \"predictable formula\" of making players collect multiple sets of items and in full for a special ending.{{r|EGM rev}} ''Next Generation'' also saw the developer creating a habit of backtracking in their games.{{r|Next Gen rev}} ''[[GameSpot]]'' was more diplomatic: those who liked collecting items would be titillated by its [[replay value]], and those who did not would be frustrated by its chores.{{r|GSpot rev}} The puzzles and minigames are fun the first time through, according to ''EGM'', but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions.{{r|EGM rev}} ''GameSpot'', however, considered parts of ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} gameplay \"cerebral\", requiring the player to consider several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles.{{r|GSpot rev}} Already familiar with the game's concepts borrowed from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Banjo-Kazooie'', reviewers considered the player's tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher.{{r|AllGame rev|IGN rev}} In retrospective reviews, ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' described the chore of collecting objects \"excessive\" and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.{{r|NL: Wii U rev|NL: N64 rev}}\n\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->Reviewers noted the game's size and length.{{r|N46 mag rev|IGN rev|NP rev|GamePro|Next Gen rev|NL: N64 rev}} With an estimated 30 hours in basic gameplay,{{r|EGM preview|N46 mag rev|NL: Wii U rev}} ''IGN'' called it Rare's ''[[War and Peace]]''.{{r|IGN rev}} \"Big\" is an understatement, wrote ''[[GameFan]]'', \"the adventure found within is mastodonic\".{{r|GameFan rev}} Reviewers became frequently lost or distracted in its world.{{r|AllGame rev|EGM rev}} Reviewers highlighted the ingenuity of the boss battles, particularly the final battle against K. Rool,{{r|N46 mag rev|EGM rev}} although the story's ending disappointed ''EGM''.{{r|EGM rev}} Reviewers found little entertainment in the multiplayer mode but praised the gameplay variety between the five characters.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev}} The controls also frustrated reviewers, between slow movement speed and camera angle issues.{{r|AllGame rev|N46 mag rev|GSpot rev|NP rev|EGM rev}} For example, characters who become unresponsive to control during their attack animations are vulnerable to encroaching enemies.{{r|EGM rev}} ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' wrote that the lack of camera improvements over ''Banjo-Kazooie'' was inexcusable.{{r|Edge rev}}\n\n<!-- GRAPHICS -->Despite its expanded memory resources, reviewers felt that ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} visuals were only marginally{{emdash}}if at all{{emdash}}better than that of its contemporary games, such as the previous year's ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]''.{{r|AllGame rev|GSpot rev|IGN rev|EGM rev}} In fact, ''[[IGN]]'' avowed that ''Donkey Kong 64'' was not as pretty as ''Banjo-Kazooie'', especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. ''IGN'' hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered its dynamic lighting overused.{{r|IGN rev}} ''[[N64 Magazine]]'' said the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths.{{r|N46 mag rev}} Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev}} ''[[GameSpot]]'' also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.{{r|GSpot rev}}\n\nThe characters have Rare's emblematic humor, and reviewers praised their individual personalities.{{r|AllGame rev|NL: N64 rev|GameFan rev}} Several reviewers noted the degree to which the character personalities showed in their animations.{{r|IGN rev|GamePro|GameFan rev}} ''IGN'' considered ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} characters less baffling than those of other Rare titles, and sometimes funny.{{r|IGN rev}} ''GameFan'' found that the addition of the three new playable characters to the series offered little personality that would be missed.{{r|GameFan rev}}\n\n<!-- SOUND -->While ''IGN'' felt that the game's music was less clever than ''Banjo-Kazooie''{{'s}}, Kirkhope's soundtrack still delivered a variety of moods{{r|IGN rev}} and fit the setting.{{r|NL: Wii U rev}} Aural clues in the surround sound and the quality of the underwater effects impressed ''GameSpot''.{{r|GSpot rev}} Reviewers criticized the opening \"DK Rap\"{{r|CVG: rap}} as \"embarrassing\"{{r|N46 mag rev}} and among the worst music to feature in a game.{{r|IGN rev}} ''GamePro'', however, thought it was humorous albeit lowbrow.{{r|GamePro}} Eight years later, ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' said the song was \"loved by some, loathed by others\", similar to the game itself.{{r|NL: N64 rev}}\n\n<!-- CONCLUSION -->Reviewers concluded that ''Donkey Kong 64'' lacked the revolutionary potential of ''Donkey Kong Country'' but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season.{{r|GSpot rev|IGN rev|EGM rev}} \"The 3D platform genre doesn't evolve with ''Donkey Kong 64'',\" ''AllGame'' wrote.{{r|AllGame rev}} While hyped fans would be disappointed, ''IGN'' felt that ''Donkey Kong 64'' remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount of things to do.{{r|IGN rev}} ''GameFan'', on the other hand, was most disappointed by how the game \"truly offers nothing new\" and compared its monotony and repetition with the film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'': \"a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness{{nbsp}}... [of] sitting through the whole thing\", it \"fails to live up to the Rare name\".{{r|GameFan rev}} ''Donkey Kong 64''{{'s}} 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to ''GameSpot'', would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 [[launch title]].{{r|GSpot rev}} With its competition considered, ''[[Daily Radar]]'' wrote that ''Donkey Kong 64'' was simply the best 3D platform game on the console.{{r|Daily Radar}} ''Edge'' qualified this thought: ''Donkey Kong 64'' was the closest any third-party developer had come to outdoing Nintendo's mastery of game structure, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo's ''Super Mario 64''. Nevertheless, the 3D ''Donkey Kong'' was \"a fine effort{{nbsp}}... in its own right\".{{r|Edge rev}}\n<!--\nIn a retrospective review, ''Nintendo Life'' found the Wii U controller an easy substitute for the Nintendo 64's controls.{{r|NL: Wii U rev}}\n-->\n\n== Legacy ==\nAlthough they received critical acclaim from critics and players, Rare's 3D platformers became notorious for their emphasis on collecting items, and ''[[Kotaku]]'' remembered ''Donkey Kong 64'' as \"the worst offender\" with hundreds of color-coded bananas.{{r|Kotaku: Yooka}} Other retrospective reviewers agreed.{{r|USgamer: Best|Kotaku: Mockery|Complex: worst}} \"As{{nbsp}}... ''Super Mario 64'' breathed life into the 3D platforming genre\", ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote, \"''Donkey Kong 64'' sucked it all out\" and solidified Rare's reputation for making \"collect-a-thon\" games.{{r|EGM 2005}} The indie developer behind ''[[A Hat in Time]]'', a spiritual successor to ''Banjo-Kazooie'', blamed ''Donkey Kong 64'' for the \"collect-a-thon platform adventurer\" genre's decline in popularity.{{r|NL: Hat|Polygon: Hat}}\n\n''Retro Gamer'' and ''Game Informer'' both remembered the game's reception as \"mixed\",{{r|RG 43|GI: Replay}} in consideration of its similarities with ''Banjo-Kazooie'' and lack of genre-pushing changes.{{r|RG 43}} Despite decent reviews, ''Donkey Kong 64'' and Rare's subsequent Nintendo 64 releases did not meet the extolment of the company's preceding games, and lackluster sales led to a staff exodus that culminated with the company's acquisition by [[Microsoft]] in 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Rare\">{{Cite web|last1=McLaughlin |first1=Rus |title=IGN Presents the History of Rare |work=[[IGN]] |date=July 28, 2008 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/28/ign-presents-the-history-of-rare?page=5 |pages=5\u20136 |accessdate=May 30, 2017 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529042610/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/28/ign-presents-the-history-of-rare?page=5 |archivedate=May 29, 2016 }}</ref> The Nintendo 64 was approaching the end of its lifecycle, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' noted at the game's launch, as gamers turned their sights to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony [[PlayStation 2]].{{r|EGM preview}} ''IGN'' later named ''Donkey Kong 64'' as worthy of being remade for Nintendo's [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS handheld console]].{{r|IGN: 3DS remake}}\n\nThe \"DK Rap\" is remembered for its negative reception.{{r|DK Rap}} Renditions of the song later appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Considered one of Belgium's greatest ever players, his primary traits as a footballer were his excellent vision, tactical intelligence, and technical skills, which allowed him to orchestrate his team's attacking moves from midfield; he was also highly regarded for his balance on the ball, and his ability to [[Dribbling#Association football|dribble]] with his head up, as well as his accurate shooting and passing ability with his right foot, which enabled him both to score goals or create chances for his teammates. However, despite his talent, he was also criticised by his managers at times for his poor defensive work-rate off the ball, his introverted character, and for being selfish and inefficient at times, in particular in his youth, as he attempted too many individual dribbling runs, rather than looking to provide a simpler pass to an open teammate. Throughout his career, his unique playing style drew comparisons with [[Gianni Rivera]], [[Giancarlo Antognoni]], and his idol [[Michel Platini]].<ref name=devil/><ref name=\"ITALIANO PER FORZA\">{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/04/23/italiano-per-forza.html|title=ITALIANO PER FORZA|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=EMANUELA AUDISIO|date=23 April 1987|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== After retirement ==\nScifo tried his hand at coaching with [[R.

Considered one of Belgium's greatest ever players, his primary traits as a footballer were his excellent vision, tactical intelligence, and technical skills, which allowed him to orchestrate his team's attacking moves from midfield; he was also highly regarded for his balance on the ball, and his ability to [[Dribbling#Association football|dribble]] with his head up, as well as his accurate shooting and passing ability with his right foot, which enabled him both to score goals or create chances for his teammates. However, despite his talent, he was also criticised by his managers at times for his poor defensive work-rate off the ball, his introverted character, and for being selfish and inefficient at times, in particular in his youth, as he attempted too many individual dribbling runs, rather than looking to provide a simpler pass to an open teammate. Throughout his career, his unique playing style drew comparisons with [[Gianni Rivera]], [[Giancarlo Antognoni]], and his idol [[Michel Platini]].<ref name=devil/><ref name=\"ITALIANO PER FORZA\">{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/04/23/italiano-per-forza.html|title=ITALIANO PER FORZA|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=EMANUELA AUDISIO|date=23 April 1987|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== After retirement ==\nScifo tried his hand at coaching with [[R.
