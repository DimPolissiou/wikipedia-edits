In 1939 Lewis resigned as ''Plaid Genedleathol Cymru'' president citing that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a Roman Catholic.<ref name=\"Daviesp593\" /> Academic and theologian [[John Edward Daniel|J E Daniel]], the party's former vice-president between 1931\u20131935, was elected as president of ''Plaid Cenedlaethol Cymru'' in 1939, serving until 1943.<ref>[https://biography.wales/article/s2-DANI-EDW-1902 Welsh Biography Online, DANIEL, JOHN EDWARD, extracted 20 April 2008]</ref>\n\n=== Criticism ===\nSaunders Lewis' perceived \"elitist views\", and a \"condescending attitude towards some aspects of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]], [[Radicalization|radical]] and [[pacifist]] traditions of Wales\" drew criticism from fellow nationalist such as [[David James Davies|David James (D.J.)

Davies pointed towards [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] as a model to emulate, and was active in the economic implications of Welsh self-government.<ref>Davies, ''op cit'', pages 591\u2013592</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding his intellect Lewis may have been ill-equipped to lead the party, or even convince his immediate colleagues of his theories. Historian Geraint H. Jenkins writes:- \"..Lewis was a cold fish. His reedy voice, bow tie, cerebral style and aristocratic contempt for the proletariat were hardly endearing qualities in a political leader, and his conversion to Catholicism lost him the sympathy of fervent Nonconformists. Heavily influenced by the discourse of right-wing French theorists, this profoundly authoritarian figure developed a grand strategy, such as it was, based on the deindustrialization of Wales. Such a scheme was both impractical and unpopular. It caused grave embarrassment to his socialist colleague D.J.Davies, a progressive economist who, writing with force and passion, showed a much better grasp of the economic  realities of the time and greater sensitivity towards the plight of working people.\"<ref>\"A Concise History of Wales\" by Geraint H Jenkins: Cambridge University Press 2007 {{ISBN|9780521530712}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking at the [[North American Association for the Study of Welsh Culture and History]] in [[Gallia County]], [[Ohio]], in 2001, Professor John Davies said\n\n<blockquote>\nThe other strand of Welsh twentieth-century radicalism- that of Plaid Cymru- also had American associations. While Saunders Lewis looked to France and Rome, that equally significant figure D.J. Davies looked to the Nordic countries and to America, in whose [[United States Army|armed forces]] he served in the First World War, as a protest against the class bound attitudes of the officers of the [[British Army]]. His inspiration came above all from the [[New Deal]], and year in year out the model he offered for the regeneration of depression-ridden Wales was the work of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]].<ref name=\"Davies' Speech\">Davies, Dr. John. North American Journal of Welsh Studies Vol. 1,1 (Winter 2001)</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was Davies' ideal of Welsh nationalism which was adopted by ''Plaid Cymru'' after the Second World War, wrote Dr. Davies. But it was Lewis' \"brilliance and charismatic appeal\" which was firmly associated with ''Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru'' in the 1930s.<ref name=\"Daviesp592\">Davies, ''op cit'', page 592</ref>\n\n''Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru's'' appeal may have been further complicated by the apparent \"fascist-style corporatism shown by [Lewis] and other Roman Catholic leaders of the party\", according to historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan, Baron Morgan|Lord Morgan]].<ref name=\"MorganDevolution\">Morgan, K O, Welsh Devolution: the Past and the Future in Scotland and Wales: Nations Again? (Ed. Taylor, B and Thomson, K), (1999), University of Wales Press</ref> Author [[G. A. Williams]] characterised the party of the 1930s as a \"right wing force\", and \"Its journal refused to resist [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] or [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], ignored or tolerated anti-Semitism and, in effect, came out in support of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\".<ref name=\"MorganDevolution\" /><ref>Williams, G A ''When Was Wales?'', (1985), Penguin.</ref><ref>Davies, D H, ''The Welsh Nationalist Party 1925\u20131945'', (1983), St. Martin's Press.</ref><ref>Morgan, K O, ''Rebirth of a Nation'', (1981), OUP.</ref>\n\nHowever, within the [[Context (language use)|context]] of the 1930s, other UK politicians of other parties offered endorsements for fascist leaders. In 1933 [[Winston Churchill]] characterised Mussolini as 'the greatest lawgiver among men',<ref>Canadine op cit p52</ref> and later wrote in his 1937 book ''[[Great Contemporaries]]'', \"If our country were defeated, I hope we should find a champion as admirable (as Hitler) to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations\". In the same work, Churchill expressed a hope that despite Hitler's apparent dictatorial tendencies, he would use his power to rebuild Germany into a worthy member of the world community. And in August 1936, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]] member [[David Lloyd George]] met Hitler at [[Berchtesgaden]] and offered some public comments that were surprisingly favourable to the German dictator, expressing warm enthusiasm both for Hitler personally and for Germany's public works schemes (upon returning, he wrote of Hitler in the ''Daily Express'' as \"the greatest living German\", \"the George Washington of Germany\").\n\n===''Bards under the bed'' 1939\u20131945===\n\nDuring the Second World War the UK government felt it prudent to \"avoid action which might foster the growth of an extreme Welsh nationalist movement\".<ref name=\"bardsunderbeds\">[http://www.south-wales.police.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=8&n2=253&n3=504&n4=846 Bards under the beds, South Wales police website]</ref> [[Clement Attlee]], UK [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] 1942\u201343, voiced concern over Welsh nationalists after a deputation of Welsh Labour UK parliamentarians met with him about ignoring Welsh issues during the conflict.\n\nAttlee characterised Welsh nationalists as \"mischievous [who] tend to be against the [[war effort]]\".<ref name=\"bardsunderbeds\" /> To root-out Welsh nationalist sympathies within army units, the UK [[Ministry of Labour and National Service]] reported that Welsh-speaking men were posted to predominantly [[Welsh Guards|Welsh-speaking units]] to report on anti-war sympathies.<ref name=\"bardsunderbeds\" />\n\nAdditional plans were developed to counter growing ''Plaid Cymru'' influence and included \"rolling out\" a member of the [[British Royal Family|U.K. Royal Family]] to \"smooth things over\", according to then constitutional expert [[Edward Iwi]].<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm Royal plans to beat nationalism Tuesday, 8 March 2005 Extracted 10-31-07]</ref> In a report he gave to [[Home Secretary]] [[Herbert Morrison]], Iwi proposed to make the then [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] [[Constable]] of [[Caernarfon Castle]] (a post held by David Lloyd George until his death in January 1945), and patroness of ''[[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]]'', and a tour of Wales as ''Urdd's'' patroness.<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\" />\n\nAppointing the princess as constable of Caernarfon Castle was rejected by the Home Secretary, as potentially creating conflict between north and south Wales, and [[King George VI]] refused to let the teenage princess tour Wales, to avoid undue pressure on her;<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\" /> the plan to make the princess patroness of ''Urdd Gobaith Cymru '' was dropped, it being thought unsuitable to link the princess, enlisted in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]], to an organisation two of whose leading members were [[conscientious objectors]].<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\" />\n\n[[File:South Wales Borderers cap badge, showing the Sphinx.jpg|left|thumb|125px|[[South Wales Borderers|So.

Rather, Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh [[nation]] \"over the loyalty to the British [[Sovereign state|State]]\".<ref name=\"Daviesp598\" /> Lewis argued, \"The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist\".<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" />\n\nHowever, most party members who claimed [[conscientious objector]] status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political conviction.<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" /> Of these, almost all were exempted from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole ground for exemption, of whom twelve received prison sentences (for refusing to attend a medical examination, as an essential preliminary to call-up, after their claim of conscientious had been refused).<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" /> For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was \"being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures\".<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" />\n\n'''University of Wales by-election, 1943'''\n\nUp to 1950 universities elected representatives to the UK parliament.

The development would include the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] (''Holly Chapel''), a Welsh-speaking community of historic significance. Despite universal and [[bi-partisan]] objections by Welsh politicians (thirty five out of thirty six Welsh [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] opposed the bill, and one abstained) the bill was passed in 1957.\n\nEvans joined Dr Tudor Jones and Capel Celyn farmer David Roberts, aged 65, at the Liverpool Town Hall to protest, and had to be forcibly ejected by police.<ref name=\"floodapology\">\n{{cite web\n| last = Coslett\n| first = Paul\n| title = Flooding Apology\n| work = Where I Live \u2013 Liverpool\n| publisher = [[bbc.co.uk]]\n| date = 2005-10-19\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/10/17/feature_welsh_reservoir_feature.shtml\n| accessdate = 2008-08-17\n| quote = A motion passed by the council on Wednesday 19 October reads, \"We realise the hurt of forty years ago when the Tryweryn Valley was transformed into a reservoir to help meet the water needs of Liverpool.

The contest was significant in that it resulted in the election of Gwynfor Evans, the first ever ''Plaid Cymru'' M.P. The contest was caused by the death of [[Megan Lloyd George|Lady Megan Lloyd George]], Labour (and former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]) MP and daughter of [[David Lloyd George|David]], 1st [[Earl Lloyd George of Dwyfor]].\n\nThis was followed by two further by-elections in [[Rhondda West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda West]] in 1967 and [[Caerphilly (UK Parliament constituency)|Caerphilly]] in 1968, in which the party achieved massive swings of 30% and 40% respectively, coming within a whisker of victory as both also won a higher proportion of the vote then it had won in Carmarthen.\n\nThe results were caused partly by an anti-Labour backlash. However, in Carmarthen particularly, ''Plaid Cymru'' also successfully depicted Labour's policies as a threat to the viability of small Welsh communities.<ref>Tanner, D, ''Facing the New Challenge: Labour and Politics 1970\u20132000'' in ''The Labour Party in Wales 1900\u20132000'' (Ed.

The Act was based on the [[Hughes Parry report]], published in 1965, which advocated equal validity for Welsh in speech and in written documents, both in the courts and in public administration in Wales. However the Act did not include all the Hughes Parry report's recommendations.

In early September 1980, Evans addressed thousands at a gathering in which \"passions ran high,\" according to Dr Davies.<ref name=\"Daviesp667\" /> The government yielded by 17 September, and the Welsh Fourth Channel ([[S4C]]) was launched on 2 November 1982.\n\n==The Wigley & Elis presidencies 1981\u20132000==\n[[File:Dafydd Wigley.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Dafydd Wigley]],<br /> two-term president]]\n\nCaernarfon MP, [[Dafydd Wigley]] succeeded Gwynfor Evans as president in 1981, inheriting a party whose morale was at an all-time low after the defeat of the ''Yes Campaign''. In 1981 the party adopted \"community socialism,\" or a \"[[decentralised]] socialist state,\" as a constitutional aim. This was in part as a consequence of [[Thatcherism]]'s effect in Wales. While the party embarked on a wide-ranging review of its priorities and goals, Evans continued his successful campaign to oblige the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] UK government to fulfil its promise to establish S4C.<ref name=\"evansdeath\" />\n\nWigley's election was seen as instrumental in deciding the future direction of ''Plaid Cymru''. Though Wigley described his own politics as 'right-wing', at the time he represented a moderate, pragmatic [[social democracy]] policy, in sharp contrast with rival candidate [[Dafydd Elis Thomas]]' far-left socialism. Wigley's triumph was also somewhat a [[pyrrhic victory]] \u2013 he won the presidency, but Thomas would have a greater influence over the party's ideology throughout the 1980s.\n\nIn 1984 Wigley resigned from the presidency because of his children's health.

After leaving Aberystwyth University, Jenkins worked in the office of [[Leanne Wood|Leanne Wood AM]] and used her contacts there to set up the organisation [[Cymru X]]. Cymru X launched the first ever interactive text referendum on a Parliament for Wales, as well as campaigns against [[nuclear arms]].

Plaid Cymru Youth has campaigned against university top-up fees, the [[Iraq War]], and the development of new nuclear arms, for the re-introduction of grants for university students, for affordable housing for young people and for a Yes vote in the [[2011 Welsh devolution referendum]]. In 2012 they launched a campaign to help tackle youth unemployment called 'Gwaith i Gymru - Work for Wales' which aims to put pressure on the Welsh Government to help young people into work or training in Wales, and includes a petition to the Welsh Assembly.\n\nPlaid Cymru Youth is run by its National Executive Committee, with an election and AGM at Plaid Cymru's Spring Conference every year.

Changes included officially using \"''Plaid''\" as the party's name, although \"Plaid Cymru \u2013 The Party of Wales\" remained the official title. The adoption of ''Plaid'', which had long been used in less formal speech as referring to ''the party'', was a recognition of its use for all party business. Additionally, the party's colours were changed from the traditional green and red to yellow, while the party logo was changed from the 'triban' (three peaks) used since 1933 to a yellow [[Welsh poppy]] (Meconopsis cambrica).\n\n===The Government of Wales Act 2006===\n{{main|Government of Wales Act 2006}}\n\nThe [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] was heavily criticised by ''Plaid'' for not delivering a fully-fledged parliament.

His reedy voice, bow tie, cerebral style and aristocratic contempt for the proletariat were hardly endearing qualities in a political leader, and his conversion to Catholicism lost him the sympathy of fervent Nonconformists. Heavily influenced by the discourse of right-wing French theorists, this profoundly authoritarian figure developed a grand strategy, such as it was, based on the deindustrialization of Wales. Such a scheme was both impractical and unpopular. It caused grave embarrassment to his socialist colleague D.J.Davies, a progressive economist who, writing with force and passion, showed a much better grasp of the economic  realities of the time and greater sensitivity towards the plight of working people.\"<ref>\"A Concise History of Wales\" by Geraint H Jenkins: Cambridge University Press 2007 {{ISBN|9780521530712}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking at the [[North American Association for the Study of Welsh Culture and History]] in [[Gallia County]], [[Ohio]], in 2001, Professor John Davies said\n\n<blockquote>\nThe other strand of Welsh twentieth-century radicalism- that of Plaid Cymru- also had American associations. While Saunders Lewis looked to France and Rome, that equally significant figure D.J. Davies looked to the Nordic countries and to America, in whose [[United States Army|armed forces]] he served in the First World War, as a protest against the class bound attitudes of the officers of the [[British Army]]. His inspiration came above all from the [[New Deal]], and year in year out the model he offered for the regeneration of depression-ridden Wales was the work of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]].<ref name=\"Davies' Speech\">Davies, Dr. John.

In the same work, Churchill expressed a hope that despite Hitler's apparent dictatorial tendencies, he would use his power to rebuild Germany into a worthy member of the world community. And in August 1936, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]] member [[David Lloyd George]] met Hitler at [[Berchtesgaden]] and offered some public comments that were surprisingly favourable to the German dictator, expressing warm enthusiasm both for Hitler personally and for Germany's public works schemes (upon returning, he wrote of Hitler in the ''Daily Express'' as \"the greatest living German\", \"the George Washington of Germany\").\n\n===''Bards under the bed'' 1939\u20131945===\n\nDuring the Second World War the UK government felt it prudent to \"avoid action which might foster the growth of an extreme Welsh nationalist movement\".<ref name=\"bardsunderbeds\">[http://www.south-wales.police.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=8&n2=253&n3=504&n4=846 Bards under the beds, South Wales police website]</ref> [[Clement Attlee]], UK [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] 1942-43, voiced concern over Welsh nationalists after a deputation of Welsh Labour UK parliamentarians met with him about ignoring Welsh issues during the conflict.\n\nAttlee characterised Welsh nationalists as \"mischievous [who] tend to be against the [[war effort]]\".<ref name=\"bardsunderbeds\" /> To root-out Welsh nationalist sympathies within army units, the UK [[Ministry of Labour and National Service]] reported that Welsh-speaking men were posted to predominantly [[Welsh Guards|Welsh-speaking units]] to report on anti-war sympathies.<ref name=\"bardsunderbeds\" />\n\nAdditional plans were developed to counter growing ''Plaid Cymru'' influence and included \"rolling out\" a member of the [[British Royal Family|U.K. Royal Family]] to \"smooth things over\", according to then constitutional expert [[Edward Iwi]].<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm Royal plans to beat nationalism Tuesday, 8 March 2005 Extracted 10-31-07]</ref> In a report he gave to [[Home Secretary]] [[Herbert Morrison]], Iwi proposed to make the then [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] [[Constable]] of [[Caernarfon Castle]] (a post held by David Lloyd George until his death in January 1945), and patroness of ''[[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]]'', and a tour of Wales as ''Urdd's'' patroness.<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\" />\n\nAppointing the princess as constable of Caernarfon Castle was rejected by the Home Secretary, as potentially creating conflict between north and south Wales, and [[King George VI]] refused to let the teenage princess tour Wales, to avoid undue pressure on her;<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\" /> the plan to make the princess patroness of ''Urdd Gobaith Cymru '' was dropped, it being thought unsuitable to link the princess, enlisted in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]], to an organisation two of whose leading members were [[conscientious objectors]].<ref name=\"princesselizabeth\" />\n\n[[File:South Wales Borderers cap badge, showing the Sphinx.jpg|left|thumb|125px|[[South Wales Borderers|So.

Rather, Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh [[nation]] \"over the loyalty to the British [[Sovereign state|State]]\".<ref name=\"Daviesp598\" /> Lewis argued, \"The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist\".<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" />\n\nHowever, most party members who claimed [[conscientious objector]] status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political conviction.<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" /> Of these, almost all were exempted from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole ground for exemption, of whom twelve received prison sentences (for refusing to attend a medical examination, as an essential preliminary to call-up, after their claim of conscientious had been refused).<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" /> For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was \"being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures\".<ref name=\"Daviesp599\" />\n\n'''University of Wales by-election, 1943'''\n\nUp to 1950 universities elected representatives to the UK parliament.

Despite universal and [[bi-partisan]] objections by Welsh politicians (thirty five out of thirty six Welsh [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] opposed the bill, and one abstained) the bill was passed in 1957.\n\nEvans joined Dr Tudor Jones and Capel Celyn farmer David Roberts, aged 65, at the Liverpool Town Hall to protest, and had to be forcibly ejected by police.<ref name=\"floodapology\">\n{{cite web\n| last = Coslett\n| first = Paul\n| title = Flooding Apology\n| work = Where I Live \u2013 Liverpool\n| publisher = [[bbc.co.uk]]\n| date = 2005-10-19\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/10/17/feature_welsh_reservoir_feature.shtml\n| accessdate = 2008-08-17\n| quote = A motion passed by the council on Wednesday 19 October reads, \"We realise the hurt of forty years ago when the Tryweryn Valley was transformed into a reservoir to help meet the water needs of Liverpool.

The contest was significant in that it resulted in the election of Gwynfor Evans, the first ever ''Plaid Cymru'' M.P. The contest was caused by the death of [[Megan Lloyd George|Lady Megan Lloyd George]], Labour (and former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]) MP and daughter of [[David Lloyd George|David]], 1st [[Earl Lloyd George of Dwyfor]].\n\nThis was followed by two further by-elections in [[Rhondda West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda West]] in 1967 and [[Caerphilly (UK Parliament constituency)|Caerphilly]] in 1968, in which the party achieved massive swings of 30% and 40% respectively, coming within a whisker of victory as both also won a higher proportion of the vote then it had won in Carmarthen.\n\nThe results were caused partly by an anti-Labour backlash. However, in Carmarthen particularly, ''Plaid Cymru'' also successfully depicted Labour's policies as a threat to the viability of small Welsh communities.<ref>Tanner, D, ''Facing the New Challenge: Labour and Politics 1970\u20132000'' in ''The Labour Party in Wales 1900\u20132000'' (Ed.

The Act was based on the [[Hughes Parry report]], published in 1965, which advocated equal validity for Welsh in speech and in written documents, both in the courts and in public administration in Wales. However the Act did not include all the Hughes Parry report's recommendations. Prior to the Act, only the English language could be spoken at government and court proceedings.\n\n==='79 ''Yes Campaign''; Hunger Strike for S4C===\n\n''See also [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum]], [[S4C]], [[Hunger strike]]''\n\nIn the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] ''Plaid Cymru'' contested every seat in Wales for the first time and its vote share surged from 4.5% in 1966 to 11.5%. Also in that year, founding member Saunders Lewis was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize]] for Literature. Evans, however, lost Carmarthen to Labour, lost again by three votes in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], but regained the seat in [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]], by which time the party had gained a further two MPs, representing the constituencies of [[Caernarfon]] and [[Merionethshire]]. Alarmed at the decrease in the number of Welsh speakers, Evans began a campaign for the establishment of a Welsh-language television channel.<ref name=\"evansdeath\" />\n\nAt the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 General Election]] the party's vote share declined from 10.8% to 8.1% and Carmarthen was again lost to Labour.\n\n''Plaid Cymru'' led the ''Yes Campaign'' in favor of devolution, though some party members were somewhat ambivalent toward home rule (as opposed to outright independence).<ref name=\"McAllisterEmergence\">McAllister, L, ''Plaid Cymru: The Emergence of a Political Party'', (2001), Seren</ref> The [[referendum]] was held on [[St David's Day]] (1 March) 1979, but the people of Wales voted against proposals to establish a [[Welsh Assembly]].\n\nOnly 12% of the Welsh electorate voted to set up a directly elected forum which would have been based in [[Cardiff]]'s Coal Exchange. The Assembly would have had the powers and budget of the [[Secretary of State for Wales]]. The plans were defeated by a majority of 4:1 (956,330 against, 243,048 for). The [[Wales Act 1978|Wales Act]] contained a requirement that at least 40% of all voters backed the plan. After the referendum results many in the party questioned its direction.<ref name=\"McAllisterEmergence\" />\n\nFollowing the ''Yes Campaign's'' defeat, and believing Welsh nationalism was \"in a paralysis of helplessness,\" the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government Home Secretary announced in September 1979 that the government would ''not'' honour its pledge in the previous May's election campaign to establish a Welsh-language television channel,<ref name=\"Daviesp680\">Davies, ''op cit'', page 680</ref> much to widespread anger and resentment in Wales, wrote Dr Davies.<ref name=\"Daviesp680\" />\n\nIn early 1980 over two thousand members of ''Plaid Cymru'' pledged to go to prison rather than pay the television licence fees, and by that spring Evans announced his intention to [[hunger strike|fast to death]] if a Welsh-language channel were not established. In early September 1980, Evans addressed thousands at a gathering in which \"passions ran high,\" according to Dr Davies.<ref name=\"Daviesp667\" /> The government yielded by 17 September, and the Welsh Fourth Channel ([[S4C]]) was launched on 2 November 1982.\n\n==The Wigley & Elis presidencies 1981\u20132000==\n[[File:Dafydd Wigley.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Dafydd Wigley]],<br /> two-term president]]\n\nCaernarfon MP, [[Dafydd Wigley]] succeeded Gwynfor Evans as president in 1981, inheriting a party whose morale was at an all-time low after the defeat of the ''Yes Campaign''. In 1981 the party adopted \"community socialism,\" or a \"[[decentralised]] socialist state,\" as a constitutional aim. This was in part as a consequence of [[Thatcherism]]'s effect in Wales. While the party embarked on a wide-ranging review of its priorities and goals, Evans continued his successful campaign to oblige the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] UK government to fulfil its promise to establish S4C.<ref name=\"evansdeath\" />\n\nWigley's election was seen as instrumental in deciding the future direction of ''Plaid Cymru''. Though Wigley described his own politics as 'right-wing', at the time he represented a moderate, pragmatic [[social democracy]] policy, in sharp contrast with rival candidate [[Dafydd Elis Thomas]]' far-left socialism. Wigley's triumph was also somewhat a [[pyrrhic victory]] \u2013 he won the presidency, but Thomas would have a greater influence over the party's ideology throughout the 1980s.\n\nIn 1984 Wigley resigned from the presidency because of his children's health. In the 1984 party leadership elections Dafydd Elis-Thomas was elected President, defeating [[Dafydd Iwan]], a move that saw the party shift to the political left.

Plaid Cymru Youth has campaigned against university top-up fees, the [[Iraq War]], and the development of new nuclear arms, for the re-introduction of grants for university students, for affordable housing for young people and for a Yes vote in the [[2011 Welsh devolution referendum]]. In 2012 they launched a campaign to help tackle youth unemployment called 'Gwaith i Gymru - Work for Wales' which aims to put pressure on the Welsh Government to help young people into work or training in Wales, and includes a petition to the Welsh Assembly.\n\nPlaid Cymru Youth is run by its National Executive Committee, with an election and AGM at Plaid Cymru's Spring Conference every year.

Changes included officially using \"''Plaid''\" as the party's name, although \"Plaid Cymru \u2013 The Party of Wales\" remained the official title. The adoption of ''Plaid'', which had long been used in less formal speech as referring to ''the party'', was a recognition of its use for all party business. Additionally, the party's colours were changed from the traditional green and red to yellow, while the party logo was changed from the 'triban' (three peaks) used since 1933 to a yellow [[Welsh poppy]] (Meconopsis cambrica).\n\n===The Government of Wales Act 2006===\n{{main|Government of Wales Act 2006}}\n\nThe [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] was heavily criticised by ''Plaid'' for not delivering a fully-fledged parliament.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82310'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Garnet'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}}.<ref name=\"USCG\">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website]</ref><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref>\n\n==Construction and design details==\n''Point Garnet'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.<ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> She was powered by two {{convert|600|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT600 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref>\n\nThe design specifications for ''Point Garnet'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref><ref name=Scotti10>Scotti, p 10</ref><ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter delivery in 1961, ''Point Garnet'' was assigned a homeport of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.<ref name=\"USCG\" />\n\nAt the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[South Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 16 other Point class cutters.<ref name=Larzelere72>Larzelere, p 72</ref><ref name=Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Garnet'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] arriving in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]].

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82310'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Garnet'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}}.<ref name=\"USCG\">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website]</ref><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref>\n\n==Construction and design details==\n''Point Garnet'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.<ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> She was powered by two {{convert|600|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT600 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref>\n\nThe design specifications for ''Point Garnet'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref><ref name=Scotti10>Scotti, p 10</ref><ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter delivery in 1961, ''Point Garnet'' was assigned a homeport of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.<ref name=\"USCG\" />\n\nAt the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[South Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 16 other Point class cutters.<ref name=Larzelere72>Larzelere, p 72</ref><ref name=Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Garnet'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] arriving in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]]. The original [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Wells\" /><ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref><ref name=Cutler82>Cutler, p 82</ref> For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.<ref name=Larzelere15>Larzelere, p 15</ref>\n\n''Point Garnet'' was assigned to Division 11 of Squadron One to be based at [[An Th\u1edbi]], a small fishing village on the southern tip of [[Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c]] island along with {{USCGC|Point Banks|WPB-82327|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Clear|WPB-82315|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Comfort|WPB-82317|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Glover|WPB-82307|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Marone|WPB-82331|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Mast|WPB-82316|6}} and {{USCGC|Point Young|WPB-82303|6}}.

Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.

Bernard and Ashley, believing Liam to be a host swapped by Dolores, try to abduct him from a charity event, but Dolores and Caleb stop them. While Dolores fights off Ashley and Caleb chases down Liam, Bernard realizes Martin is the swapped host.

The town is close to the coast and the mouth of the [[Waikouaiti River]].\n\nToday, Waikouaiti is a retail trade and servicing centre for the surrounding district, which has sheep farming as the principal primary activity. A major egg producer, Zeagold Foods, a branch of Mainland Poultry LTD has a 500,000-hen [[factory farming]] operation here and is in the process of expanding over the next year to meet demand for egg products. [[Hawksbury, New Zealand|Hawksbury]], 3&nbsp;km southwest of Waikouaiti, has a [[Evansdale Cheese|cheese factory and shop]], a swimming pool and housing developed from the old [[mental health]] institution, [[Cherry Farm]]. [[Karitane]], 3&nbsp;km to the southeast has a small fishing port. Waikouaiti is also a thriving hub for \"busy bodies\" whom feel the need to prize thier nose in things that don't concern them it has been suggested that these people find themselves a hobby.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans the area was occupied by [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], who had a kaik, or unfortified settlement, at modern [[Karitane]] and a [[Pa (M\u0101ori)|pa]], or fortified settlement, on the adjacent Huriawa Peninsula.\n{{stack|[[File:Matanaka - Granary, Privy & Schoolhouse.jpg|thumb|These [[Matanaka Farm]] buildings from the 1840s are a Category I registered historic place]]}}\nAn 1826 sketch of the east Otago coast, shows the headlands and beaches of what are now Karitane and Waikouaiti.<ref>Otago coast map sketch - Thomas Shepherd (1779\u20131835), Original in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. Reproduced in [[Peter Entwisle|Entwisle]], 2005, illustration 17</ref>\n\nWaikouaiti was the first European settlement in southern New Zealand to be mainly based on farming and one of the first enduring European settlements in [[Otago]].  From 1837 there had been a whaling station confusingly also called \"Waikouaiti\" nearby on the south side of the estuary at what is now called \"Karitane\". Having already purchased large areas of land in the South Island (much of which was later declared to have been iinvalid) [[Johnny Jones (pioneer)|Johnny Jones]] sent settlers from [[Sydney, Australia]] in the ''Magnet'' to farm the district in 1840, eight years before the foundation of the Otago Association's settlement.<ref name=TeAraJones>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1j4/jones-john E.

His original homestead and some of the associated buildings of his colonial manor farm, known as [[Matanaka Farm]], which still stand on Cornish Head, date from this time. The farm buildings, though not the homestead, are owned by [[Heritage New Zealand]] and are open to the public.

The wooden shingle roofed St. John's Anglican Church in Waikouaiti proper opened in 1858, was funded by Jones. It was designed by [[Benjamin Mountfort]] of Christchurch who also designed the Provincial Council Building there. In 1861 [[William Chapman (doctor)|Dr. William Chapman]], at Jones request, became the first [[General Practitioner|GP]] for the district.\n\nThe Presbyterians built a wooden church in 1863. It was moved to Kildare Street in 1876 and still remains. It became the Sunday School when a brick church was built in 1914, designed by [[J.Louis Salmond]] but this building closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2009.\n\n[[File:East Otago Events Centre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The modern East Otago Events Centre which is used for many community activities]]\n\n==Place names==\n\nThe town of Waikouaiti was initially called \"Hawksbury,\" a name that still applies to the Hawksbury Lagoon [[wetland]] in the centre of the town, known in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] as '''Matainaka''',<ref name=\"place names\">''[http://www.puketeraki.co.nz/sites/default/files/Place%20names_0.pdf Place names]'' on K\u0101ti Huirapa Runaka ki Puketeraki website, viewed 2012-01-04</ref> and also adopted in the name of the residential/industrial redevelopment at the former [[Cherry Farm]] Hospital.\nThe name Waikouaiti is [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]], and is believed to come from phrases meaning \"small bitter waters\" (''wai-kawa-iti'') or \"braided streamlets\" (''wai-koua-iti''). This placename once applied to a [[whaling]] station at [[Karitane]], but subsequently drifted to the present location.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nWaikouaiti is located on [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] 40 kilometres north of Dunedin city centre and 666 kilometres from [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]].\n\nWaikouaiti is serviced by the Dunedin to Palmerston bus service operated by [[Passenger Transport (New Zealand)|Dunedin Passenger Transport]].

The town is close to the coast and the mouth of the [[Waikouaiti River]].\n\nToday, Waikouaiti is a retail trade and servicing centre for the surrounding district, which has sheep farming as the principal primary activity. A major egg producer, Zeagold Foods, a branch of Mainland Poultry LTD has a 500,000-hen [[factory farming]] operation here and is in the process of expanding over the next year to meet demand for egg products. [[Hawksbury, New Zealand|Hawksbury]], 3&nbsp;km southwest of Waikouaiti, has a [[Evansdale Cheese|cheese factory and shop]], a swimming pool and housing developed from the old [[mental health]] institution, [[Cherry Farm]]. [[Karitane]], 3&nbsp;km to the southeast has a small fishing port.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans the area was occupied by [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], who had a kaik, or unfortified settlement, at modern [[Karitane]] and a [[Pa (M\u0101ori)|pa]], or fortified settlement, on the adjacent Huriawa Peninsula.\n{{stack|[[File:Matanaka - Granary, Privy & Schoolhouse.jpg|thumb|These [[Matanaka Farm]] buildings from the 1840s are a Category I registered historic place]]}}\nAn 1826 sketch of the east Otago coast, shows the headlands and beaches of what are now Karitane and Waikouaiti.<ref>Otago coast map sketch - Thomas Shepherd (1779\u20131835), Original in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. Reproduced in [[Peter Entwisle|Entwisle]], 2005, illustration 17</ref>\n\nWaikouaiti was the first European settlement in southern New Zealand to be mainly based on farming and one of the first enduring European settlements in [[Otago]].  From 1837 there had been a whaling station confusingly also called \"Waikouaiti\" nearby on the south side of the estuary at what is now called \"Karitane\". Having already purchased large areas of land in the South Island (much of which was later declared to have been iinvalid) [[Johnny Jones (pioneer)|Johnny Jones]] sent settlers from [[Sydney, Australia]] in the ''Magnet'' to farm the district in 1840, eight years before the foundation of the Otago Association's settlement.<ref name=TeAraJones>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1j4/jones-john E.

His original homestead and some of the associated buildings of his colonial manor farm, known as [[Matanaka Farm]], which still stand on Cornish Head, date from this time. The farm buildings, though not the homestead, are owned by [[Heritage New Zealand]] and are open to the public. They are the oldest surviving farm buildings in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = Historic Places to Visit in Otago/Southland\n| url        = http://www.historicplaces.org.nz/placesToVisit/otagosouthland.aspx\n| accessdate = 26 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"NZHPT 7787\">{{NZHPT|7787|Matanaka Farm|30 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nJones moved to Dunedin in 1854<ref name=TeAraJones/> but was influential in the development of Waikouaiti for many years after. The wooden shingle roofed St. John's Anglican Church in Waikouaiti proper opened in 1858, was funded by Jones. It was designed by [[Benjamin Mountfort]] of Christchurch who also designed the Provincial Council Building there. In 1861 [[William Chapman (doctor)|Dr. William Chapman]], at Jones request, became the first [[General Practitioner|GP]] for the district.\n\nThe Presbyterians built a wooden church in 1863. It was moved to Kildare Street in 1876 and still remains. It became the Sunday School when a brick church was built in 1914, designed by [[J.Louis Salmond]] but this building closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2009.\n\n[[File:East Otago Events Centre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The modern East Otago Events Centre which is used for many community activities]]\n\n==Place names==\n\nThe town of Waikouaiti was initially called \"Hawksbury,\" a name that still applies to the Hawksbury Lagoon [[wetland]] in the centre of the town, known in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] as '''Matainaka''',<ref name=\"place names\">''[http://www.puketeraki.co.nz/sites/default/files/Place%20names_0.pdf Place names]'' on K\u0101ti Huirapa Runaka ki Puketeraki website, viewed 2012-01-04</ref> and also adopted in the name of the residential/industrial redevelopment at the former [[Cherry Farm]] Hospital.\nThe name Waikouaiti is [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]], and is believed to come from phrases meaning \"small bitter waters\" (''wai-kawa-iti'') or \"braided streamlets\" (''wai-koua-iti''). This placename once applied to a [[whaling]] station at [[Karitane]], but subsequently drifted to the present location.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nWaikouaiti is located on [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] 40 kilometres north of Dunedin city centre and 666 kilometres from [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]].\n\nWaikouaiti is serviced by the Dunedin to Palmerston bus service operated by [[Passenger Transport (New Zealand)|Dunedin Passenger Transport]]. The bus operates thrice daily each way Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays).<ref>[http://www.orc.govt.nz/Information-and-Services/Buses/1-2---Palmerston-to-Dunedin--Dunedin-to-Palmerston/ Otago Regional Council: Timetable]</ref>\n\n===Railway===\nThe [[Main South Line]] [[railway]] between [[Christchurch]] and [[Invercargill]] passes through Waikouaiti. It was constructed in the 1870s, and daily passenger trains passed through Waikouaiti until the cancellation of the [[Southerner (New Zealand train)|Southerner]] in February 2002.

However, response to the company's products at the CP/M-82 show in San Francisco showed that a U.S. company would be needed to reach the American market. They met [[Philippe Kahn]], who had just moved to Silicon Valley, and who had been a key developer of the [[Micral]]. The three Danes had embarked, at first successfully, on marketing software first from Denmark, and later from Ireland, before running into some challenges at the time when they met Philippe Kahn.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Kahn was chairman, president, and CEO of Borland Inc. from its inception in 1983 until 1995. Main shareholders at the incorporation of Borland were Niels Jensen (250,000 shares), Ole Henriksen (160,000), Mogens Glad (100,000), and Kahn (80,000).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Borland International, Inc. era===\nBorland developed a series of well-regarded software development tools. Its first product was [[Turbo Pascal]] in 1983, developed by [[Anders Hejlsberg]] (who later developed .NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product sold in Scandinavia under the name of Compas Pascal. 1984 saw the launch of [[Borland Sidekick]], a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility that was an early and popular [[terminate and stay resident program]] (TSR) for [[DOS]] operating systems.\n\nBy the mid-1980s the company had become so successful that it had the largest exhibit at the 1985 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] other than IBM or AT&T.<ref name=\"pournelle198508\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-08/1985_08_BYTE_10-08_Declarative_Languages#page/n299/mode/2up | title=The West Coast Computer Faire | work=BYTE | date=August 1985 | accessdate=27 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=293}}</ref> [[Bruce Webster]] reported that \"the legend of Turbo Pascal has by now reached mythic proportions, as evidenced by the number of firms that, in marketing meetings, make plans to become 'the next Borland'\".<ref name=\"webster198608\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-08/1986_08_BYTE_11-08_Object-Oriented_Languages#page/n355/mode/2up | title=Going to the Faire | work=BYTE | date=August 1986 | accessdate=23 September 2016 | author=Webster, Bruce | pages=323\u2013328}}</ref> After Turbo Pascal and Sidekick the company successfully launched other applications such as SuperKey and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Kahn, [[Tim Berry (entrepreneur)|Tim Berry]], John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986. [[Schroders]] was the lead investment banker. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with [[Goldman Sachs]] as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.\n\nIn 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its [[Borland Reflex|Reflex]] database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by [[Brad Silverberg]] and including Reflex co-founder [[Adam Bosworth]], became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at [[Microsoft]]. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the [[Quattro Pro|Quattro]] project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became [[Microsoft Access|Access]].\n\nIn 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into [[Turbo C]]. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987, and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen & Partners International(JPI), later [[TopSpeed]]. JPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++ and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the [[Clarion (programming language)|Clarion]] 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.\n\nIn September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their [[Borland Paradox|Paradox]] (version 2.0) [[database]] management tool. Richard Schwartz, a cofounder of Ansa, became Borland's CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.\n\nThe [[Quattro Pro]] spreadsheet was launched in 1989 with, at the time, a notable improvement and charting capabilities. Lotus Development, under the leadership of [[Jim Manzi]] sued Borland for copyright infringement (see [[Look and feel]]). The litigation, ''[[Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.]]'',<ref name=LotusVBorland>{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18208011207990458376&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr |title=Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 516 U.S. 233|access-date=April 24, 2012}}</ref> brought forward Borland's open standards position as opposed to Lotus' closed approach. Borland, under Kahn's leadership took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus' legal position and \"fight for programmer's rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After a decision in favor of Borland by the [[First Circuit Court of Appeals]], the case went to the United States Supreme Court. Because Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had recused himself, only eight Justices heard the case, and it ended in a 4\u20134 tie.<ref name=LotusVBorland/> As a result, the First Circuit decision remained standing, but the Supreme Court result, being a tie, did not bind any other court and set no national precedent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Ryan |last2=Epstein |first2=Lee |title=Recusal and the \"Problem\" of an Equally Divided Supreme Court |journal=Journal of Appellate Practice and Process |date=Spring 2005 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201399, 81 |url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/recusal.html |access-date=April 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215531/http://epstein.usc.edu/research/recusal.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Borland was known for its practical and creative approach towards [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]] and [[intellectual property]] (IP), introducing its \"Borland no-nonsense license agreement\". This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products \"just like a book\"; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.{{Citation needed| date= September 2016}}\n\n====The 1990s: Rise and change====\nIn September 1991 Borland purchased [[Ashton-Tate]], bringing the [[dBASE]] and [[InterBase]] databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. [[Microsoft]] launched the competing database [[Microsoft Access]] and bought the dBASE clone [[FoxPro]] in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices. During the early 1990s Borland's implementation of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It went through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, and became a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.\n\nThe internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the downfall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready.<ref>[http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html Delayed Graphical Products Put Dent in Borland\u2019s Image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192941/http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html |date=2011-07-21 }}, PC Week, April 20, 1992</ref> Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the [[ObjectVision]] team, redeployed) headed by [[Bill Turpin]] to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase, and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.\n\nDuring 1993 Borland explored ties with [[WordPerfect]] as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by [[Novell]]. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.\n\n[[Philippe Kahn]] and the Borland board disagreed on how to focus the company, and Kahn resigned as chairman, CEO and president, after 12 years, in January 1995.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Baby's arrival inspires birth of cellphone camera \u2014 and societal evolution |author= Kevin Maney |date= January 23, 2007 |work= USA Today |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2007-01-23-kahn-cellphone-camera_x.htm |accessdate= September 14, 2016 }}</ref> Kahn remained on the board until November 7, 1996.<ref name=\"KahnBoard\">{{cite press release|publisher=Borland |date= November 7, 1996 |url=http://www.borland.com/about/press/1996/pkresign.html |title=Kahn Resigns as Borland Director \u2013 Cites Increasing Demands of New Business |accessdate= September 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010618010852/http://www.borland.com/about/press/1996/pkresign.html |archivedate=June 18, 2001 }}</ref> Borland named [[Gary Wetsel]] as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996.

When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business. In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).\n\nIn 1999, Dale L. Fuller replaced Yocam. At this time Fuller's title was \"interim president and CEO.\" The \"interim\" was dropped in December 2000. [[Keith Gottfried]] served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.\n\nA proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing [[Linux]]-based products. The scheme was abandoned when Corel's shares fell and it became clear that there was really no strategic fit.\n\n[[InterBase]] 6.0 was made available as [[open-source software]] in July 2000.\n\nOn 2000-11-14, Inprise Corporation announced the company intends to officially change its name to Borland Software Corporation.

This brought Borland's expertise in [[integrated development environment]]s to the Linux platform for the first time. Kylix was launched in 2001.\n\nPlans to spin off the [[InterBase]] division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation. Borland stopped open-source releases of InterBase and has developed and sold new versions at a fast pace.\n\nIn 2001 Delphi 6 became the first integrated development environment to support web services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itweb.co.za/content/kYbe97XxAkB7AWpG|title=Borland delivers on web services promises with Delphi 6|last=Partners|first=Global Research|date=2001-07-12|website=ITWeb|language=en-ZA|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> All of the company's development platforms now support web services.\n\n[[CSharpBuilder|C#Builder]] was released in 2003 as a native [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] development tool, competing with [[Visual Studio .NET]].

Its first product was [[Turbo Pascal]] in 1983, developed by [[Anders Hejlsberg]] (who later developed .NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product sold in Scandinavia under the name of Compas Pascal. 1984 saw the launch of [[Borland Sidekick]], a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility that was an early and popular [[terminate and stay resident program]] (TSR) for [[DOS]] operating systems.\n\nBy the mid-1980s the company had become so successful that it had the largest exhibit at the 1985 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] other than IBM or AT&T.<ref name=\"pournelle198508\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-08/1985_08_BYTE_10-08_Declarative_Languages#page/n299/mode/2up | title=The West Coast Computer Faire | work=BYTE | date=August 1985 | accessdate=27 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=293}}</ref> [[Bruce Webster]] reported that \"the legend of Turbo Pascal has by now reached mythic proportions, as evidenced by the number of firms that, in marketing meetings, make plans to become 'the next Borland'\".<ref name=\"webster198608\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-08/1986_08_BYTE_11-08_Object-Oriented_Languages#page/n355/mode/2up | title=Going to the Faire | work=BYTE | date=August 1986 | accessdate=23 September 2016 | author=Webster, Bruce | pages=323\u2013328}}</ref> After Turbo Pascal and Sidekick the company successfully launched other applications such as SuperKey and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Kahn, [[Tim Berry (entrepreneur)|Tim Berry]], John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986. [[Schroders]] was the lead investment banker. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with [[Goldman Sachs]] as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.\n\nIn 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its [[Borland Reflex|Reflex]] database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by [[Brad Silverberg]] and including Reflex co-founder [[Adam Bosworth]], became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at [[Microsoft]]. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the [[Quattro Pro|Quattro]] project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became [[Microsoft Access|Access]].\n\nIn 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into [[Turbo C]]. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987, and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen & Partners International(JPI), later [[TopSpeed]]. JPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++ and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the [[Clarion (programming language)|Clarion]] 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.\n\nIn September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their [[Borland Paradox|Paradox]] (version 2.0) [[database]] management tool. Richard Schwartz, a cofounder of Ansa, became Borland's CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.\n\nThe [[Quattro Pro]] spreadsheet was launched in 1989 with, at the time, a notable improvement and charting capabilities. Lotus Development, under the leadership of [[Jim Manzi]] sued Borland for copyright infringement (see [[Look and feel]]). The litigation, ''[[Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.]]'',<ref name=LotusVBorland>{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18208011207990458376&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr |title=Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 516 U.S. 233|access-date=April 24, 2012}}</ref> brought forward Borland's open standards position as opposed to Lotus' closed approach. Borland, under Kahn's leadership took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus' legal position and \"fight for programmer's rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After a decision in favor of Borland by the [[First Circuit Court of Appeals]], the case went to the United States Supreme Court. Because Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had recused himself, only eight Justices heard the case, and it ended in a 4\u20134 tie.<ref name=LotusVBorland/> As a result, the First Circuit decision remained standing, but the Supreme Court result, being a tie, did not bind any other court and set no national precedent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Ryan |last2=Epstein |first2=Lee |title=Recusal and the \"Problem\" of an Equally Divided Supreme Court |journal=Journal of Appellate Practice and Process |date=Spring 2005 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201399, 81 |url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/recusal.html |access-date=April 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215531/http://epstein.usc.edu/research/recusal.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Borland was known for its practical and creative approach towards [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]] and [[intellectual property]] (IP), introducing its \"Borland no-nonsense license agreement\". This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products \"just like a book\"; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.{{Citation needed| date= September 2016}}\n\n====The 1990s: Rise and change====\nIn September 1991 Borland purchased [[Ashton-Tate]], bringing the [[dBASE]] and [[InterBase]] databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. [[Microsoft]] launched the competing database [[Microsoft Access]] and bought the dBASE clone [[FoxPro]] in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices. During the early 1990s Borland's implementation of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It went through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, and became a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.\n\nThe internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the downfall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready.<ref>[http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html Delayed Graphical Products Put Dent in Borland\u2019s Image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192941/http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html |date=2011-07-21 }}, PC Week, April 20, 1992</ref> Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the [[ObjectVision]] team, redeployed) headed by [[Bill Turpin]] to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase, and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.\n\nDuring 1993 Borland explored ties with [[WordPerfect]] as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by [[Novell]]. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.\n\n[[Philippe Kahn]] and the Borland board disagreed on how to focus the company, and Kahn resigned as chairman, CEO and president, after 12 years, in January 1995.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Baby's arrival inspires birth of cellphone camera \u2014 and societal evolution |author= Kevin Maney |date= January 23, 2007 |work= USA Today |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2007-01-23-kahn-cellphone-camera_x.htm |accessdate= September 14, 2016 }}</ref> Kahn remained on the board until November 7, 1996.<ref name=\"KahnBoard\">{{cite press release|publisher=Borland |date= November 7, 1996 |url=http://www.borland.com/about/press/1996/pkresign.html |title=Kahn Resigns as Borland Director \u2013 Cites Increasing Demands of New Business |accessdate= September 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010618010852/http://www.borland.com/about/press/1996/pkresign.html |archivedate=June 18, 2001 }}</ref> Borland named [[Gary Wetsel]] as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996.

When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business. In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).\n\nIn 1999, Dale L. Fuller replaced Yocam. At this time Fuller's title was \"interim president and CEO.\" The \"interim\" was dropped in December 2000. [[Keith Gottfried]] served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.\n\nA proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing [[Linux]]-based products. The scheme was abandoned when Corel's shares fell and it became clear that there was really no strategic fit.\n\n[[InterBase]] 6.0 was made available as [[open-source software]] in July 2000.\n\nOn 2000-11-14, Inprise Corporation announced the company intends to officially change its name to Borland Software Corporation.

Kylix was launched in 2001.\n\nPlans to spin off the [[InterBase]] division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation.

As of 2013, it has a population of 5,977 inhabitants, while the town of Kostajnica has a population of 4,047 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality was created from part of the pre-war municipality of [[Novi Grad, Bosanska Krajina|Novi Grad]]. It is located across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river from [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]], [[Croatia]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Bosnia-herzegovina Bosanska Kostajnica.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Passport stamp bearing just the name Kostajnica.]]\nIt is considered, that the name of town and municipality of Kostajnica originates from the old [[Slavic languages|slavic]] word for [[Castanea sativa|sweet chestnut]] (kostanj). Therefore the name Kostajnica means the land of chestnuts. Indeed, that is true, because the forests of the Kostajnica municipality grow this particular tree. The name of this settlement was first recorded in the year 1258. The name Kostajnica is used for the both settlements in the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] valley (Kostajnica-[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|BiH]] and [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]]-[[Croatia|Cro]]) which surround the Kostajnica castle.<ref>[https://turizamrs.org/kostajnica-kroz-istoriju/ \u201eTouristic organisation of the Republic of Srpska - Kostajnica through the history\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms of the Kostajnica municipality has a form of a medieval [[shield]]. In the central part of it is a chestnut with a leaf, that represents the origin of the name of this municipality and of the rare plant, that grows in this area. In the lower part of coat of arms are two leaves that together make a lower frame. Above these two leaves are the river [[Una (Sava)|Una]] (represented with blue colour), on the left side is the bridge, that connects two towns, and on the right side is the medieval Castle. Behind the chestnut and the leaf in the central part are two curves that represent the hill of Balj, where one could find these precious fruits - chestnuts. On the top of the coat of arms is the flag of the [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srpska]]. Stone blocks represent the will to build and to be strong. Inn the upper central part of the coat of arms there is written 1258 which represents the year when name Kostajnica was first recorded . <ref>[http://www.opstina-kostajnica.com/images/stories/Statut_optine_Kostajnica_5_16.pdf \u201eOfficial gazette of the Municipality of Kostajnica, number 5/16\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Name==\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], when the municipality of Kostajnica was created (it was a part of the [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Novi Grad municipality]]), the name of the town was renamed to ''Srpska Kostajnica'' (\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430). After that the name of the town was changed to ''Bosanska Kostajnica''. The final name of the settlement and the municipality is only ''Kostajnica'', according to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. <ref>http://www.opstina-kostajnica.com/</ref><ref>[https://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/clanak/ustavni-sud-rs-dopustio-ukidanje-prefiksa-bosanski-20090708/print \u201eRepublika Srpska Constitutional Court allowed revocation of prefix \"bosnian\"\u201d]</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\nThe Kostajnica municipality encompasses a very small area in comparison to the other municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The municipality has an area of 85,12 km2 and it was formed in the year 1995, therefore it is one of the youngest municipalities in the Republic of Srpska. On the area of the whole municipality there are 11 rural settlements and only one urban settlement (Kostajnica - municipality seat). The settlements that are make up the territory of this municipalities are: Gornja Slabinja, Grdanovac, Gumnjani, Zovik, Kalenderi, '''Kostajnica''', Mrakodol, Mraovo Polje, Petrinja, Pobr\u0111ani, Podo\u0161ka and Tavija. \n\n==History==\nHuman settlements in the area of Kostajnica municipality was first recorded from a so called \"[[Vu\u010dedol Culture]]\" period. According to the found remains and preserved documents, it is known that in the era of the [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], there was trade traffic across the Una River in the territory of the present municipality of Kostajnica. Owing to its location, Kostajnica was already a significant settlement within Roman water supply system. The name Kostajnica was first mentioned as a toponym in the year 1258. During the [[Middle Ages]] Kostajnica, as a significant commercial settlement and fortress, was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]], ie. in possession of a nobleman who recognized the Hungarian crown. After 1513. (the victory of the Turks at [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Dubica]]), the following masters changed in constant warfare: the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], later the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]. As an integral part of the [[Illyrian Provinces|Kingdom of Illyria]], in 1809 the area of Kostajnica came under the rule of [[Napoleon]], and remained until 1814. During the French rule, a wooden bridge was built between the two \"Kostajnicas\" (two towns that are situated on the both sides of the Una river banks) to facilitate the flow of goods and people. That was then the only bridge on the Una river that served to transport goods from the Middle East to Europe and vice versa. After a brief French administration, Kostajnica again came under Turkish rule in 1814. During the period of Turkish rule, the population of this region raised numerous uprisings. The most famous is Pecia's uprising in 1858, that was led by the [[hajduk|hajduks]] Petar Petrovic Pecija and Petar Garaca. In 1878 Kostajnica again came under Austrian rule and remained until the end of [[World War I]]. During the Austro-Hungarian period Kostajnica was first a district, and later a part of the Bosnian-Novi district. During the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] Kostajnica was a trade and crafts center. During [[World War II]], the population of this region participated massively in the fight against fascism. This is evidenced by the legendary Balj Company (named after the hill above Kostajnica), which was made up of fighters mostly recruited from the area. In addition to the fallen fighters, as many as 1,848, inhabitants of the municipality lost their lives as victims of the fascist terror war. Their execution sites are [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], Zemun, Baji\u0107a jame and Ze\u010devo Brdo. After World War II, Kostajnica, under the name Bosanska Kostajnica, existed as a municipality within the Bosanski-Novi and later Prijedor district.<ref>-{\u040b\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0416.}-: ''-{\u041e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}-''; -{''\u0106ur\u010dija, \u017d.''}-: ''-{Srpska Kostajnica Municipality}-'' Kostajnica, march 1995. </ref>\n\n==Geographical position==\nThe Kostajnica municipality is situated in north-west part of [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srspka]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and lies at one of the ends of Republika Srpska territory (Other is [[Trebinje]] at the south-east). The area of Kostajnica municipality lies on the right river bank of Una river. North and north-west border represents river Una, which is also the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, south border is border with [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Novi Grad municipality]].

For this town the border checkpoint between BiH and Croatia has a large importance for the local economy and it is located at the very centre of the city. Through the territory of this municipality runs the railway [[Zagreb]] - [[Banja Luka]], namely through the settlement Grdanovac, but there is currently no railway station, nor is planed.

As of 2013, it has a population of 5,977 inhabitants, while the town of Kostajnica has a population of 4,047 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality was created from part of the pre-war municipality of [[Novi Grad, Bosanska Krajina|Novi Grad]]. It is located across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river from [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]], [[Croatia]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Bosnia-herzegovina Bosanska Kostajnica.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Passport stamp bearing just the name Kostajnica.]]\nIt is considered, that the name of town and municipality of Kostajnica originates from the old [[Slavic languages|slavic]] word for [[Castanea sativa|sweet chestnut]] (kostanj). Therefore the name Kostajnica means the land of chestnuts. Indeed, that is true, because the forests of the Kostajnica municipality grow this particular tree. The name of this settlement was first recorded in the year 1258. The name Kostajnica is used for the both settlements in the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] valley (Kostajnica-[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|BiH]] and [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]]-[[Croatia|Cro]]) which surround the Kostajnica castle.<ref>[https://turizamrs.org/kostajnica-kroz-istoriju/ \u201eTouristic organisation of the Republic of Srpska - Kostajnica through the history\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms of the Kostajnica municipality has a form of a medieval [[shield]]. In the central part of it is a chestnut with a leaf, that represents the origin of the name of this municipality and of the rare plant, that grows in this area. In the lower part of coat of arms are two leaves that together make a lower frame. Above these two leaves are the river [[Una (Sava)|Una]] (represented with blue colour), on the left side is the bridge, that connects two towns, and on the right side is the medieval Castle. Behind the chestnut and the leaf in the central part are two curves that represent the hill of Balj, where one could find these precious fruits - chestnuts. On the top of the coat of arms is the flag of the [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srpska]]. Stone blocks represent the will to build and to be strong. Inn the upper central part of the coat of arms there is written 1258 which represents the year when name Kostajnica was first recorded . <ref>[http://www.opstina-kostajnica.com/images/stories/Statut_optine_Kostajnica_5_16.pdf \u201eOfficial gazette of the Municipality of Kostajnica, number 5/16\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Name==\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], when the municipality of Kostajnica was created (it was a part of the [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Novi Grad municipality]]), the name of the town was renamed to ''Srpska Kostajnica'' (\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430). After that the name of the town was changed to ''Bosanska Kostajnica''. The final name of the settlement and the municipality is only ''Kostajnica'', according to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. <ref>http://www.opstina-kostajnica.com/</ref><ref>[https://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/clanak/ustavni-sud-rs-dopustio-ukidanje-prefiksa-bosanski-20090708/print \u201eRepublika Srpska Constitutional Court allowed revocation of prefix \"bosnian\"\u201d]</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\nThe Kostajnica municipality encompasses a very small area in comparison to the other municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The municipality has an area of 85,12 km2 and it was formed in the year 1995, therefore it is one of the youngest municipalities in the Republic of Srpska. On the area of the whole municipality there are 11 rural settlements and only one urban settlement (Kostajnica - municipality seat). The settlements that are make up the territory of this municipalities are: Gornja Slabinja, Grdanovac, Gumnjani, Zovik, Kalenderi, '''Kostajnica''', Mrakodol, Mraovo Polje, Petrinja, Pobr\u0111ani, Podo\u0161ka and Tavija. \n\n==History==\nHuman settlements in the area of Kostajnica municipality was first recorded from a so called \"[[Vu\u010dedol Culture]]\" period. According to the found remains and preserved documents, it is known that in the era of the [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], there was trade traffic across the Una River in the territory of the present municipality of Kostajnica. Due to it's location, Kostajnica was already a significant settlement within Roman water supply system. The name Kostajnica was first mentioned as a toponym in the year 1258. During the [[Middle Ages]] Kostajnica, as a significant commercial settlement and fortress, was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]], ie. in possession of a nobleman who recognized the Hungarian crown. After 1513. (the victory of the Turks at [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Dubica]]), the following masters changed in constant warfare: the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], later the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]. As an integral part of the [[Illyrian Provinces|Kingdom of Illyria]], in 1809 the area of Kostajnica came under the rule of [[Napoleon]], and remained until 1814. During the French rule, a wooden bridge was built between the two \"Kostajnicas\" (two towns that are situated on the both sides of the Una river banks) to facilitate the flow of goods and people. That was then the only bridge on the Una river that served to transport goods from the Middle East to Europe and vice versa. After a brief French administration, Kostajnica again came under Turkish rule in 1814. During the period of Turkish rule, the population of this region raised numerous uprisings. The most famous is Pecia's uprising in 1858, that was led by the [[hajduk|hajduks]] Petar Petrovic Pecija and Petar Garaca. In 1878 Kostajnica again came under Austrian rule and remained until the end of [[World War I]]. During the Austro-Hungarian period Kostajnica was first a district, and later a part of the Bosnian-Novi district. During the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] Kostajnica was a trade and crafts center. During [[World War II]], the population of this region participated massively in the fight against fascism. This is evidenced by the legendary Balj Company (named after the hill above Kostajnica), which was made up of fighters mostly recruited from the area. In addition to the fallen fighters, as many as 1,848, inhabitants of the municipality lost their lives as victims of the fascist terror war. Their execution sites are [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], Zemun, Baji\u0107a jame and Ze\u010devo Brdo. After World War II, Kostajnica, under the name Bosanska Kostajnica, existed as a municipality within the Bosanski-Novi and later Prijedor district.<ref>-{\u040b\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0416.}-: ''-{\u041e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}-''; -{''\u0106ur\u010dija, \u017d.''}-: ''-{Srpska Kostajnica Municipality}-'' Kostajnica, march 1995. </ref>\n\n==Geographical position==\nThe Kostajnica municipality is situated in north-west part of [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srspka]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and lies at one of the ends of Republika Srpska territory (Other is [[Trebinje]] at the south-east). The area of Kostajnica municipality lies on the right river bank of Una river. North and north-west border represents river Una, which is also the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, south border is border with [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Novi Grad municipality]].

For this town the border checkpoint between BiH and Croatia has a large importance for the local economy and it is located at the very centre of the city. Through the territory of this municipality runs the railway [[Zagreb]] - [[Banja Luka]], namely through the settlement Grdanovac, but there is currently no railway station, nor is planed.
