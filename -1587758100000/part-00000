Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago (with one [[taxon]] having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia. Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous [[aardwolf]] survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the [[Extant taxon|extant]] spotted, [[brown hyena|brown]] and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\nHyenas feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures that live alongside them. Hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt. In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence people's spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children.<ref name=\"m96\">{{Harvnb|Mills|Hofer|1998|p=96}}</ref> Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in [[Traditional medicine|traditional African medicine]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=A study on use of animals as traditional medicine by Sukuma Tribe of Busega District in North-western Tanzania|first1=Rajeev|last1=Vats|first2=Simion|last2=Thomas|date=7 May 2015|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine|volume=11|pages=38|doi=10.1186/s13002-015-0001-y|pmid = 25947365|pmc=4472419}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Origins===\nHyenas originated in the jungles of [[Miocene]] Eurasia 22 million years ago, when most early feliform species were still largely [[arboreal]]. The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern [[banded palm civet]]; one of the earliest hyena species described, ''[[Plioviverrops]]'', was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20\u201322 million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the [[middle ear]] and dentition. The lineage of ''Plioviverrops'' prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in [[North America]].<ref name=\"mac119\">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1992|pp=119\u2013144}}</ref>\n\n===Rise and fall of the dog-like hyenas===\n[[File:Ictitherium viverrinum.JPG|left|thumb|Skull of ''Ictitherium viverrinum'', one of the \"dog-like\" hyenas. [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]\nThe descendants of ''Plioviverrops'' reached their peak 15 million years ago, with more than 30 species having been identified. Unlike most modern hyena species, which are specialised bone-crushers, these dog-like hyenas were nimble-bodied, wolfish animals; one species among them was ''[[Ictitherium]] viverrinum'', which was similar to a [[jackal]]. The dog-like hyenas were very numerous; in some Miocene fossil sites, the remains of ''Ictitherium'' and other dog-like hyenas outnumber those of all other carnivores combined. The decline of the dog-like hyenas began 5\u20137 million years ago during a period of climate change, which was exacerbated when [[canid]]s crossed the [[Bering land bridge]] to Eurasia. One species, ''[[Chasmaporthetes|Chasmaporthetes ossifragus]]'', managed to cross the land bridge into North America, being the only hyena to do so. ''Chasmopothertes'' managed to survive for some time in North America by deviating from the [[cursorial]] and bone-crushing niches monopolised by canids, and developing into a [[cheetah]]-like sprinter. Most of the dog-like hyenas had died off by 1.5 million years ago.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\n===Bone-crushing hyenas===\nBy 10\u201314 million years ago, the hyena family had split into two distinct groups: dog-like hyenas and bone-crushing hyenas. The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built family [[Percrocutidae]]. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the dog subfamily [[Borophaginae]]. By 5 million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas had become the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by [[sabre-toothed cat]]s. One genus, ''[[Pachycrocuta]]'', was a 200&nbsp;kg (440&nbsp;lb) mega-scavenger that could splinter the bones of [[elephant]]s {{cn|date=June 2018}}. With the decline of large herbivores by the late ice age, ''Pachycrocuta'' was replaced by the smaller ''Crocuta''.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\n===Rise of modern hyenas===\n[[File:Stripedspottedhyenas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skeletons of a [[striped hyena]] and a [[spotted hyena]], two species of the \"bone-crushing\" hyenas]]\nThe four extant species are the striped hyena (''Hyaena hyeana''), the brown hyena (''Hyaena brunnea''), the spotted hyena (''Crocuta crocuta''), and the aardwolf (''Proteles cristata'').\n\nThe [[aardwolf]] can trace its lineage directly back to ''Plioviverrops'' 15 million years ago, and is the only survivor of the dog-like hyena lineage. Its success is partly attributed to its insectivorous diet, for which it faced no competition from canids crossing from North America. Its unrivaled ability to digest the [[terpene]] excretions from soldier [[termite]]s is likely a modification of the strong digestive system its ancestors used to consume fetid carrion.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\nThe [[striped hyena]] may have evolved from ''H. namaquensis'' of [[Pliocene]] [[Africa]]. Striped hyena fossils are common in Africa, with records going back as far as the [[Villafranchian]]. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the [[Mediterranean]] region, it is likely that the species is a relatively late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of [[spotted hyena]]s in Asia at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. The striped hyena occurred for some time in [[Europe]] during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. It also occurred in [[Montmaurin]], [[Hollabrunn]] in [[Austria]], the Furninha Cave in [[Portugal]] and the Genista Caves in [[Gibraltar]]. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the [[brown hyena]].<ref name=\"k66\">{{Harvnb|Kurt\u00e9n|1968|pp=66\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThe [[spotted hyena]] (''Crocuta crocuta'') diverged from the striped and brown hyena 10 million years ago.<ref name=\"m1\">{{Harvnb|Mills|Hofer|1998|p=1}}</ref> Its direct ancestor was the Indian ''Crocuta sivalensis'', which lived during the Villafranchian.<ref name=\"k69\" /> Ancestral spotted hyenas probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from rivals on carcasses, thus forcing them to operate in teams. Spotted hyenas evolved sharp [[carnassial]]s behind their crushing premolars, therefore they did not need to wait for their prey to die, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger [[territory (animal)|territories]], necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's turf.<ref name=\"mac119\" /> Spotted hyenas spread from their original homeland during the [[Middle Pleistocene]], and quickly colonised a very wide area from Europe, to southern Africa and [[China]].<ref name=\"k69\">{{Harvnb|Kurt\u00e9n|1968|pp=69\u201372}}</ref> With the decline of grasslands 12,500 years ago, Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by [[grey wolf|wolves]] and [[human]]s, who were as much at home in forests as in open lands&mdash;and in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink after roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from [[Western Europe]] between 11 and 14 thousand years ago, and earlier in some areas.<ref name=\"hyenawolf\">{{cite web | url = http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mstiner/pdf/Stiner2004a.pdf| title = Comparative ecology and taphonomy of spotted hyenas, humans, and wolves in Pleistocene Italy | work = C.

Note the greatly reduced molars and carnassials, rendered redundant from insectivory]]\nHyenas have relatively short torsos and are fairly massive and wolf-like in build, but have lower hind quarters, high withers and their backs slope noticeably downward toward their rumps. The forelegs are high, while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short. Their skulls superficially resemble those of large canids, but are much larger and heavier, with shorter facial portions. Hyenas are [[digitigrade]], with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads.<ref name=\"h3\" /> Like canids, hyenas have short, blunt, non-retractable claws.<ref name=\"p62\" /> Their [[Fur|pelage]] is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur. Most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head.<ref name=\"h3\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|1992|p=3}}</ref> With the exception of the spotted hyena, hyaenids have striped coats, which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors.<ref name=\"mac119\" /> Their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa.<ref name=\"p62\" /> Their [[vertebral column]], including the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical region]] are of limited mobility.

The [[carnassial]]s, especially the upper, are very powerful and are shifted far back to the point of exertion of peak pressure on the jaws. The other teeth, save for the underdeveloped upper [[molar (tooth)|molars]], are powerful, with broad bases and cutting edges.

It is often difficult to know whether spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In western African tales, spotted hyenas are sometimes depicted as bad [[Muslim]]s who challenge the local [[animism]] that exists among the Beng in [[C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In East Africa, [[Tabwa]] mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth, while West African folklore generally shows the hyena as symbolising immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits. In Tanzania, there is a belief that [[witch]]es use spotted hyenas as mounts.<ref name=\"magic\"/> In the [[Mtwara Region]] of Tanzania, it is believed that a child born at night while a hyena is crying will likely grow up to be a thief.

Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago (with one [[taxon]] having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia. Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous [[aardwolf]] survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the [[Extant taxon|extant]] spotted, [[brown hyena|brown]] and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\nHyenas feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures that live alongside them. Hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt. In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence people's spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children.<ref name=\"m96\">{{Harvnb|Mills|Hofer|1998|p=96}}</ref> Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in [[Traditional medicine|traditional African medicine]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=A study on use of animals as traditional medicine by Sukuma Tribe of Busega District in North-western Tanzania|first1=Rajeev|last1=Vats|first2=Simion|last2=Thomas|date=7 May 2015|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine|volume=11|pages=38|doi=10.1186/s13002-015-0001-y|pmid = 25947365|pmc=4472419}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Origins===\nHyenas originated in the jungles of [[Miocene]] Eurasia 22 million years ago, when most early feliform species were still largely [[arboreal]]. The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern [[banded palm civet]]; one of the earliest hyena species described, ''[[Plioviverrops]]'', was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20\u201322 million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the [[middle ear]] and dentition. The lineage of ''Plioviverrops'' prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in [[North America]].<ref name=\"mac119\">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1992|pp=119\u2013144}}</ref>\n\n===Rise and fall of the dog-like hyenas===\n[[File:Ictitherium viverrinum.JPG|left|thumb|Skull of ''Ictitherium viverrinum'', one of the \"dog-like\" hyenas. [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]\nThe descendants of ''Plioviverrops'' reached their peak 15 million years ago, with more than 30 species having been identified. Unlike most modern hyena species, which are specialised bone-crushers, these dog-like hyenas were nimble-bodied, wolfish animals; one species among them was ''[[Ictitherium]] viverrinum'', which was similar to a [[jackal]]. The dog-like hyenas were very numerous; in some Miocene fossil sites, the remains of ''Ictitherium'' and other dog-like hyenas outnumber those of all other carnivores combined. The decline of the dog-like hyenas began 5\u20137 million years ago during a period of climate change, which was exacerbated when [[canid]]s crossed the [[Bering land bridge]] to Eurasia. One species, ''[[Chasmaporthetes|Chasmaporthetes ossifragus]]'', managed to cross the land bridge into North America, being the only hyena to do so. ''Chasmopothertes'' managed to survive for some time in North America by deviating from the [[cursorial]] and bone-crushing niches monopolised by canids, and developing into a [[cheetah]]-like sprinter. Most of the dog-like hyenas had died off by 1.5 million years ago.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\n===Bone-crushing hyenas===\nBy 10\u201314 million years ago, the hyena family had split into two distinct groups: dog-like hyenas and bone-crushing hyenas. The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built family [[Percrocutidae]]. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the dog subfamily [[Borophaginae]]. By 5 million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas had become the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by [[sabre-toothed cat]]s. One genus, ''[[Pachycrocuta]]'', was a 200&nbsp;kg (440&nbsp;lb) mega-scavenger that could splinter the bones of [[elephant]]s {{cn|date=June 2018}}. With the decline of large herbivores by the late ice age, ''Pachycrocuta'' was replaced by the smaller ''Crocuta''.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\n===Rise of modern hyenas===\n[[File:Stripedspottedhyenas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Skeletons of a [[striped hyena]] and a [[spotted hyena]], two species of the \"bone-crushing\" hyenas]]\nThe four extant species are the striped hyena (''Hyaena hyeana''), the brown hyena (''Hyaena brunnea''), the spotted hyena (''Crocuta crocuta''), and the aardwolf (''Proteles cristata'').\n\nThe [[aardwolf]] can trace its lineage directly back to ''Plioviverrops'' 15 million years ago, and is the only survivor of the dog-like hyena lineage. Its success is partly attributed to its insectivorous diet, for which it faced no competition from canids crossing from North America. Its unrivaled ability to digest the [[terpene]] excretions from soldier [[termite]]s is likely a modification of the strong digestive system its ancestors used to consume fetid carrion.<ref name=\"mac119\" />\n\nThe [[striped hyena]] may have evolved from ''H. namaquensis'' of [[Pliocene]] [[Africa]]. Striped hyena fossils are common in Africa, with records going back as far as the [[Villafranchian]]. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the [[Mediterranean]] region, it is likely that the species is a relatively late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of [[spotted hyena]]s in Asia at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. The striped hyena occurred for some time in [[Europe]] during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. It also occurred in [[Montmaurin]], [[Hollabrunn]] in [[Austria]], the Furninha Cave in [[Portugal]] and the Genista Caves in [[Gibraltar]]. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the [[brown hyena]].<ref name=\"k66\">{{Harvnb|Kurt\u00e9n|1968|pp=66\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThe [[spotted hyena]] (''Crocuta crocuta'') diverged from the striped and brown hyena 10 million years ago.<ref name=\"m1\">{{Harvnb|Mills|Hofer|1998|p=1}}</ref> Its direct ancestor was the Indian ''Crocuta sivalensis'', which lived during the Villafranchian.<ref name=\"k69\" /> Ancestral spotted hyenas probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from rivals on carcasses, thus forcing them to operate in teams. Spotted hyenas evolved sharp [[carnassial]]s behind their crushing premolars, therefore they did not need to wait for their prey to die, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger [[territory (animal)|territories]], necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's turf.<ref name=\"mac119\" /> Spotted hyenas spread from their original homeland during the [[Middle Pleistocene]], and quickly colonised a very wide area from Europe, to southern Africa and [[China]].<ref name=\"k69\">{{Harvnb|Kurt\u00e9n|1968|pp=69\u201372}}</ref> With the decline of grasslands 12,500 years ago, Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by [[grey wolf|wolves]] and [[human]]s, who were as much at home in forests as in open lands&mdash;and in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink after roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from [[Western Europe]] between 11 and 14 thousand years ago, and earlier in some areas.<ref name=\"hyenawolf\">{{cite web | url = http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mstiner/pdf/Stiner2004a.pdf| title = Comparative ecology and taphonomy of spotted hyenas, humans, and wolves in Pleistocene Italy | work = C.

The forelegs are high, while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short. Their skulls superficially resemble those of large canids, but are much larger and heavier, with shorter facial portions. Hyenas are [[digitigrade]], with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads.<ref name=\"h3\" /> Like canids, hyenas have short, blunt, non-retractable claws.<ref name=\"p62\" /> Their [[Fur|pelage]] is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur. Most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head.<ref name=\"h3\">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|1992|p=3}}</ref> With the exception of the spotted hyena, hyaenids have striped coats, which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors.<ref name=\"mac119\" /> Their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa.<ref name=\"p62\" /> Their [[vertebral column]], including the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical region]] are of limited mobility.

It is often difficult to know whether spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In western African tales, spotted hyenas are sometimes depicted as bad [[Muslim]]s who challenge the local [[animism]] that exists among the Beng in [[C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In East Africa, [[Tabwa]] mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth, while West African folklore generally shows the hyena as symbolising immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits. In Tanzania, there is a belief that [[witch]]es use spotted hyenas as mounts.<ref name=\"magic\"/> In the [[Mtwara Region]] of Tanzania, it is believed that a child born at night while a hyena is crying will likely grow up to be a thief.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

However, on 11 April 1200 [[John, King of England|King John]] granted it to Maurice (son of Roger of Powis), who had offered half that sum. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\n===Rebellions===\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance, but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, by his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers, but it was clearly considerable, for in the spring of 1201, when King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] with 100 knights to counter the rebellion of Fulk and of William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref> In July 1202 Fulk and his men were reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\". One other, Eustace de Kivilly, had been pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\n===Settlement and status===\nAfter years as an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned, together with over thirty of his followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, and their cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)]], a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref> On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\n===Later confrontations===\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington.<ref>T.D.

Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41-42</ref><ref>I.J.

As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

The transfer of electrons through cable bacteria allows the sulfate reduction that occurs in inundated soils to be balanced by sulfate oxidation. Oxidation is possible because of the release of electrons through the cable bacteria filaments. Through this balance, sulfate remains readily available for [[sulfate reducing bacteria]], which out compete [[Methanogen|methanogens.]] This causes a decrease in production of methane by methanogens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scholz VV, Meckenstock RU, Nielsen LP, Risgaard-Petersen N | title = Cable bacteria reduce methane emissions from rice-vegetated soils | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1878 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32313021 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-020-15812-w | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15812-w }}</ref>\n\n==Practical applications==\nCable bacteria have been found associated with benthic [[microbial fuel cells]], devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy.<ref name=\"Reimers2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wendeberg A | title = Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the identification of environmental microbes | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2010 | issue = 1 | pages = pdb.prot5366 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20150125 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot5366 }}</ref> In the future, cable bacteria may play a role in increasing the efficiency of [[microbial fuel cells]].

Phosphorus can cause [[eutrophication]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas.\n\n==== Methane emissions ====\nThe presence of cable bacteria can lead to a decrease in methane emissions from saturated soils. The transfer of electrons through cable bacteria allows the sulfate reduction that occurs in inundated soils to be balanced by sulfate oxidation. Oxidation is possible because of the release of electrons through the cable bacteria filaments. Through this balance, sulfate remains readily available for [[sulfate reducing bacteria]], which out compete [[Methanogen|methanogens.]] This causes a decrease in production of methane by methanogens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scholz VV, Meckenstock RU, Nielsen LP, Risgaard-Petersen N | title = Cable bacteria reduce methane emissions from rice-vegetated soils | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1878 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 32313021 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-020-15812-w | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15812-w }}</ref>\n\n==Practical applications==\nCable bacteria have been found associated with benthic [[microbial fuel cells]], devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy.<ref name=\"Reimers2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wendeberg A | title = Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the identification of environmental microbes | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2010 | issue = 1 | pages = pdb.prot5366 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20150125 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot5366 }}</ref> In the future, cable bacteria may play a role in increasing the efficiency of [[microbial fuel cells]].

The band's debut single \"[[Gunj\u014d Biyori]]\" was released in September 2004, and they ended activities in February 2012. The band sold 2.3 million albums, singles, and DVDs. The band reunited and released a new single on January 1, 2020.{{cite needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins (2003)===\nTokyo Jihen started as Ringo Sheena's [[backing band]] at first for her last concert tour before ending the first half of her solo career. Sheena was contemplating working with a band while working on her last solo album, [[Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana|''Kalk Samen'' ''Kuri no Hana'']]. She began looking for members of her [[backing band]] to support her solo tour \"[[Electric Mole#Sugoroku Ecstasy|Sugoroku Ecstasy]]\" in the Autumn of 2003. The tour band was introduced as Tokyo Jihen during the tour for the first time, featuring guitarist Mikio Hirama, pianist [[H Zett M]], drummer Toshiki Hata, and familiar bassist [[Seiji Kameda]]. The musicians she selected became the core of what would become Tokyo Jihen.\n\nAfter the tour, she announced that she would stop her solo career to join \"Tokyo Jihen\" as a full-fledged member.\n\n=== \"''Phase 1''\" era  and its end (2004\u20132005) ===\nOn May 31, 2004, the members of the Tokyo Jihen declared that they worked as a permanent band. On July 24, they appeared in the presence of fans at the live ''0724 Yamabikari'' for the first time. They played some live sets during that year's ''[[Fuji Rock Festival]]'', and made their major debut with the single \"Gunj\u014d Biyori\" on September 8. Tokyo Jihen released one album and two singles, and held their first [[concert tour]] -Tokyo Jihen live tour 2005 \"dynamite!\"-.\n\nOn July 1, 2005, it was announced during the tour that keyboardist H ZETT M and guitarist Mikio Hirama would leave Tokyo Jihen. H ZETT M returned to his duties as pianist for [[PE'Z]], and Hirama went back to being a solo singer. It was decided that they would withdraw from the band before the ''\"''dynamite!\" tour started.\n\nAfter the departure of the band's former guitarist and keyboardist, Sheena began a search for new members. She was going to have at least a keyboard player join because two people left the band at the same time. H ZETT M recommended his friend and former bandmate, Keitaro Izawa, as a substitute for him to Sheena, but she began visiting music clubs to look for other keyboardists.<ref>She found Kiyoshi Hasegawa at a certain club at the time. His songs were in her mother's record collection, and she also liked them. The two of them would play together taking advantage of this opportunity.</ref> In the end she found no one who was better than Izawa, and Sheena decided to invite him to join. He assumed the stage name of [[Ichiyo Izawa]] during his time with the band.\n\nThe search for a new guitarist proved more difficult. Sheena approached several guitarists as potential members,<ref>Sheena said during the \"Just can't help it\" tour that she invited [[Tomotaka Imamichi]] of [[Barbee Boys]], but he declined the offer.</ref> but was turned down by all of them, possibly because they disliked the idea of being considered her \"backing band\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} At worst, she planned to choose a different guitarist each time without having a regular guitarist. However, when the other members listened to the first Tokyo Jihen album ''[[Ky\u014diku]]'' [[Demo (music)|demos]], the situation changed. All of them were pleased with the demo session guitarist and asked Sheena his name. This guitarist was [[Ryosuke Nagaoka]], who assumed the stage name of Ukigumo after joining Tokyo Jihen. Sheena and Ukigumo had been friends since her days as a soloist. He turned down the offer to join Tokyo Jihen at first, but finally accepted just before recording began for [[Adult (album)|''Adult'']].\n\nWith so many members replaced, Sheena considered changing the name of the band, but decided against it in the end.\n\nIn September 2005, keyboardist Ichiy\u014d Izawa and guitarist Ukigumo formally joined Tokyo Jihen. The lineup including the former members subsequently came to be called {{nihongo|'''Dai-Ikki'''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u671f|Phase 1}}, with the current one referred to as {{nihongo|'''Dai-Niki'''|\u7b2c\u4e8c\u671f|Phase 2}}.\n\n=== Beginning of \"''Phase 2''\" (2006\u20132007) ===\nThe band's second album \"Adult\", released on January 25, 2006, went to number one on the [[Oricon]] charts, a first for the band. They held two concerts, entitled \"DOMESTIC! Virgin LINE\", at [[Nippon Budokan Hall]] and [[Osaka-jo Hall]] in February as the new members debut. A nationwide tour, \"DOMESTIC!\" ''Just can't help it'' followed later the same year.\n\nIn the latter half of 2006, Sheena produced the [[film score]] of the [[movie]] ''[[Sakuran]]'', on which three of the other four band members (excluding Hata, who had broken his leg) collaborated.\n\nFollowing the 2007 release of two singles, \"[[O.S.C.A. (Tokyo Jihen Single)|O.S.C.A.]]\" and \"[[Killer-tune (Tokyo Jihen Single)|Killer-tune]]\", and an album, [[Variety (Tokyo Incidents album)|''Variety'']], the first release not containing any compositions by Sheena, they embarked on the concert tour \"Tokyo Jihen live tour 2007 Spa & Treatment\" to promote the album.\n\n=== Members' activities outside Tokyo Jihen (2008\u20132009) ===\nThe [[music video]] for \"Killer-tune\" won the Best Technical Works Video category in the March 15, 2008 [[Space Shower Music Video Awards]] ''08'' by [[Space Shower TV]].\n\nAs 2008 marked the 10th anniversary of Sheena's professional debut, she resumed solo activities as \"Ringo Sheena\" for the first time since the formation of Tokyo Jihen. She participated in the summer [[Rising Sun Rock Festival]] both as a soloist and as a member of Tokyo Jihen. The activity of Tokyo Jihen was thus restricted during this period.\n\nIn 2009, Sheena continued her solo activity from the previous year with the release of a new solo album, her first since 2003's [[Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana|''Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana'']], in June. During the same period, Ukigumo and Izawa resumed activities with their respective bands. Kameda returned to his work as a producer, overseeing several top ten releases, and Hata participated in the recording and subsequent tour for [[Fujifabric]]'s new album. Sheena, Ukigumo, and Izawa were all involved in the production of [[Rie Tomosaka]]'s album ''Toridori'' the same year. Ukigumo and Izawa joined Tomosaka's promotional tour as part of her [[backing band]].\n\nOn May 25, 2009, it was announced that Izawa had joined \"[[The Hiatus]]\", a new band formed by former [[Ellegarden]] member Takeshi Hosomi. They defined The Hiatus as \"a project of music, arts, and depicters\" on the band's official site. Izawa was listed as a tour member on the site, and took part in their \"Trash We'd Love Tour 2009\". Izawa also held some concerts with Hosomi as {{Nihongo|\"Hosomi Ichiy\u014d\"|\u7d30\u7f8e\u4e00\u8449}} from October to December.\n\nOn December 2, 2009, Tokyo Jihen released the single \"[[N\u014dd\u014dteki Sanpunkan]]\", their first in two years, and resumed their activity as a band full-time. They appeared as part of the lineup of the December 30, 2009 [[:ja:COUNTDOWN JAPAN|Countdown Japan 09/10]].\n\n=== Final years and dissolution (2010\u20132012) ===\nThe fourth album ''[[Sports (Tokyo Incidents album)|Sports]]'', released on February 24, 2010 won the 1st place in [[Oricon]] chart after an interval of four years. The nationwide tour \"Tokyo Incident live tour 2010 UltraC\" started in March.\n\nThe fifth album ''[[Dai Hakken]]'' was released on June 29, 2011, and the nationwide tour \"Tokyo Incident live tour 2011 Discovery\" started in September 30.\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Ringo Sheena announced their break up on their official site. Their last original release, a mini-album entitled [[Color Bars (Tokyo Jihen Album)|''Color Bars'']], was released on January 18, 2012. A live [[best of album]], [[Tokyo Collection (Tokyo Jihen Album)|''Tokyo Collection'']], and a concert DVD and Blu-ray release of their \"Discovery Tour\" went on sale on February 15. Tokyo Jihen's embarked on a final tour, entitled \"Domestique Bon Voyage''\"'', which included [[Yokohama Arena]] (February 14\u201315), Osaka-jo Hall (February 21\u201322), and Tokyo's Nippon Budokan (February 28\u201329).\n\nThe band officially dissolved on February 29, 2012, after their sold-out final Budokan concert.<ref name=\"Bon Voyage\">After a reported 660,000 applicants for tickets to the tour, approximately 60 times the [[seating capacity]] of the Nippon Budokan, it was decided that the final concert would be simulcast live in 156 movie theaters across Japan, as well as in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Singapore]].</ref> On June 15, an announcement on Sheena's official site, Kronekodow, revealed that Tokyo Jihen would release one final album, ''[[Shin'ya Waku]]''  ''(The Edge of Late Night)'', and DVD/Blu-ray video, ''Chin Play Kou Play'' (''Strange Plays and Great Plays'') in August of that year. The album, a collection of B-sides, included the previously unreleased-on-CD \"Handsome Sugite\" and one new song, \"Tadanaranu Kankei\". The video contained highlights from the band's best live performances along with festival appearances and rare material.\n\n=== After dissolution ===\nOn December 31, 2016, when Sheena Ringo participated in the [[67th NHK K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]], Tokyo Jihen played as her backing band. However, the band's name was not written in the credits.  Ukigumo and H Zett M have been regular collaborators with Ringo, playing on recorded work and in backing bands on her live tours.\n\n=== Reunion ===\nOn January 1, 2020, Tokyo Jihen released a surprise digital single, \"Erabarezaru Kokumin''\"'', and announced a tour of Japan titled \"Live Tour 2020 News Flash\", beginning February 29.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/music/news/361792|title=\u6771\u4eac\u4e8b\u5909\u3001\u958f\u5e74\u306b\u201c\u518d\u751f\u201d\uff08\u52d5\u753b\u3042\u308a\uff09|last=|first=|date=|website=\u97f3\u697d\u30ca\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://j-generation.com/tokyo-jihen-drops-surprise-single-and-announces-2020-japan-tour/|title=Tokyo Jihen drops surprise single and announces 2020 Japan tour|last=|first=|date=2020-01-01|website=J-Generation|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref> In February, the band announced their 5-song EP ''[[News (EP)|News]]'' would be released on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://j-generation.com/tokyo-jihen-to-bring-you-the-news-starting-april-8/|title=Tokyo Jihen to bring you the News starting April 8|last=Cirone|first=David|date=2020-02-11|website=J-Generation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\n== Members ==\n\n=== ''Phase 2'' members ===\n{{nihongo|'''[[Ringo Sheena]]'''|[[:ja:\u690e\u540d\u6797\u6a8e|\u690e\u540d \u6797\u6a8e]]|Shiina Ringo}}\n* Active: 2003\u20132012 2019-present\n* Instruments: [[Lead vocalist|Lead vocals]], [[Electric guitar]], [[Acoustic guitar]], [[Piano]], [[Electronic keyboards]], [[Melodica]], [[Kazoo]]\n* Real name: {{nihongo|'''Yumiko Shiina'''|\u690e\u540d \u88d5\u7f8e\u5b50|Shiina Yumiko}}\n:Sheena is an acclaimed [[singer-songwriter]] who has enjoyed enormous popularity since her debut at the age of 18.\n:She is the founder and the leader of the group, and initially wrote almost all their songs, but later shared songwriting duties with the other band members.\n\n{{nihongo|'''[[Seiji Kameda]]'''|[[:ja:\u4e80\u7530\u8aa0\u6cbb|\u4e80\u7530 \u8aa0\u6cbb]]|Kameda Seiji}}\n* Active: 2003\u20132012\n* Instruments: [[Bass guitar]], [[Double bass|Upright bass]], [[Electric upright bass]]\n:Kameda is a [[Record producer|music producer]] and [[music arranger]] for many Japanese musicians.\n:Kameda is also a famous session bassist.

engineer]]\n:Inoue has produced Sheena's works all the time since her second album. Sheena calls him \"the sixth member\".\n\n===Naming of members===\nThe real names of Hirama and Hata are \"\u5e73\u9593 \u5e79\u592e\" and \"\u7551 \u5229\u6a39\" respectively, but, Ringo Sheena gave them stage names, using [[Kanji]] which is not usually used for their names, but as they are the phonetic equivalent, the pronunciation is not changed.\nSince Ryosuke Nagaoka always drifted unsteadily and nobody knew where he would go, Sheena named Nagaoka \"Ukigumo\" which means the drifting cloud.\nSheena planned to give Keitaro Izawa a stage name, but he refused and chose one for himself, Ichiy\u014d Izawa.\n\n== Music production ==\nSheena and Izawa write a musical score. Kameda takes various means, recording a humming and using musical instruments or the PC. Since Ukigumo cannot write a score, Izawa or Sheena (mainly Izawa) copies down his tune in the studio.\n\nHata stubbornly kept refusing to write music, even declining to write lyrics when Sheena asked him to. However, he finally changed his mind.\n\nSince Ukigumo writes music without considering a song, it is hard for Sheena to put the words to his music. That's why he often writes lyrics by himself.\n\n==Concerts and tours==\n\n'''Tours'''\n*[[Live Tour 2005 \"Dynamite!\"|Dynamite!]] (2005)\n*[[Domestic! Virgin Line]] (2006)\n*Domestic!

The band's debut single \"[[Gunj\u014d Biyori]]\" was released in September 2004, and they ended activities in February 2012. The band sold 2.3 million albums, singles, and DVDs. The band reunited and released a new single on January 1st, 2020.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins (2003)===\nTokyo Jihen started as Ringo Sheena's [[backing band]] at first for her last concert tour before ending the first half of her solo career. Sheena was contemplating working with a band while working on her last solo album, [[Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana|''Kalk Samen'' ''Kuri no Hana'']]. She began looking for members of her [[backing band]] to support her solo tour \"[[Electric Mole#Sugoroku Ecstasy|Sugoroku Ecstasy]]\" in the Autumn of 2003. The tour band was introduced as Tokyo Jihen during the tour for the first time, featuring guitarist Mikio Hirama, pianist [[H Zett M]], drummer Toshiki Hata, and familiar bassist [[Seiji Kameda]]. The musicians she selected became the core of what would become Tokyo Jihen.\n\nAfter the tour, she announced that she would stop her solo career to join \"Tokyo Jihen\" as a full-fledged member.\n\n=== \"''Phase 1''\" era  and its end (2004\u20132005) ===\nOn May 31, 2004, the members of the Tokyo Jihen declared that they worked as a permanent band. On July 24, they appeared in the presence of fans at the live ''0724 Yamabikari'' for the first time. They played some live sets during that year's ''[[Fuji Rock Festival]]'', and made their major debut with the single \"Gunj\u014d Biyori\" on September 8. Tokyo Jihen released one album and two singles, and held their first [[concert tour]] -Tokyo Jihen live tour 2005 \"dynamite!\"-.\n\nOn July 1, 2005, it was announced during the tour that keyboardist H ZETT M and guitarist Mikio Hirama would leave Tokyo Jihen. H ZETT M returned to his duties as pianist for [[PE'Z]], and Hirama went back to being a solo singer. It was decided that they would withdraw from the band before the ''\"''dynamite!\" tour started.\n\nAfter the departure of the band's former guitarist and keyboardist, Sheena began a search for new members. She was going to have at least a keyboard player join because two people left the band at the same time. H ZETT M recommended his friend and former bandmate, Keitaro Izawa, as a substitute for him to Sheena, but she began visiting music clubs to look for other keyboardists.<ref>She found Kiyoshi Hasegawa at a certain club at the time. His songs were in her mother's record collection, and she also liked them. The two of them would play together taking advantage of this opportunity.</ref> In the end she found no one who was better than Izawa, and Sheena decided to invite him to join. He assumed the stage name of [[Ichiyo Izawa]] during his time with the band.\n\nThe search for a new guitarist proved more difficult. Sheena approached several guitarists as potential members,<ref>Sheena said during the \"Just can't help it\" tour that she invited [[Tomotaka Imamichi]] of [[Barbee Boys]], but he declined the offer.</ref> but was turned down by all of them, possibly because they disliked the idea of being considered her \"backing band\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} At worst, she planned to choose a different guitarist each time without having a regular guitarist. However, when the other members listened to the first Tokyo Jihen album ''[[Ky\u014diku]]'' [[Demo (music)|demos]], the situation changed. All of them were pleased with the demo session guitarist and asked Sheena his name. This guitarist was [[Ryosuke Nagaoka]], who assumed the stage name of Ukigumo after joining Tokyo Jihen. Sheena and Ukigumo had been friends since her days as a soloist. He turned down the offer to join Tokyo Jihen at first, but finally accepted just before recording began for [[Adult (album)|''Adult'']].\n\nWith so many members replaced, Sheena considered changing the name of the band, but decided against it in the end.\n\nIn September 2005, keyboardist Ichiy\u014d Izawa and guitarist Ukigumo formally joined Tokyo Jihen. The lineup including the former members subsequently came to be called {{nihongo|'''Dai-Ikki'''|\u7b2c\u4e00\u671f|Phase 1}}, with the current one referred to as {{nihongo|'''Dai-Niki'''|\u7b2c\u4e8c\u671f|Phase 2}}.\n\n=== Beginning of \"''Phase 2''\" (2006\u20132007) ===\nThe band's second album \"Adult\", released on January 25, 2006, went to number one on the [[Oricon]] charts, a first for the band. They held two concerts, entitled \"DOMESTIC! Virgin LINE\", at [[Nippon Budokan Hall]] and [[Osaka-jo Hall]] in February as the new members debut. A nationwide tour, \"DOMESTIC!\" ''Just can't help it'' followed later the same year.\n\nIn the latter half of 2006, Sheena produced the [[film score]] of the [[movie]] ''[[Sakuran]]'', on which three of the other four band members (excluding Hata, who had broken his leg) collaborated.\n\nFollowing the 2007 release of two singles, \"[[O.S.C.A. (Tokyo Jihen Single)|O.S.C.A.]]\" and \"[[Killer-tune (Tokyo Jihen Single)|Killer-tune]]\", and an album, [[Variety (Tokyo Incidents album)|''Variety'']], the first release not containing any compositions by Sheena, they embarked on the concert tour \"Tokyo Jihen live tour 2007 Spa & Treatment\" to promote the album.\n\n=== Members' activities outside Tokyo Jihen (2008\u20132009) ===\nThe [[music video]] for \"Killer-tune\" won the Best Technical Works Video category in the March 15, 2008 [[Space Shower Music Video Awards]] ''08'' by [[Space Shower TV]].\n\nAs 2008 marked the 10th anniversary of Sheena's professional debut, she resumed solo activities as \"Ringo Sheena\" for the first time since the formation of Tokyo Jihen. She participated in the summer [[Rising Sun Rock Festival]] both as a soloist and as a member of Tokyo Jihen. The activity of Tokyo Jihen was thus restricted during this period.\n\nIn 2009, Sheena continued her solo activity from the previous year with the release of a new solo album, her first since 2003's [[Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana|''Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana'']], in June. During the same period, Ukigumo and Izawa resumed activities with their respective bands. Kameda returned to his work as a producer, overseeing several top ten releases, and Hata participated in the recording and subsequent tour for [[Fujifabric]]'s new album. Sheena, Ukigumo, and Izawa were all involved in the production of [[Rie Tomosaka]]'s album ''Toridori'' the same year. Ukigumo and Izawa joined Tomosaka's promotional tour as part of her [[backing band]].\n\nOn May 25, 2009, it was announced that Izawa had joined \"[[The Hiatus]]\", a new band formed by former [[Ellegarden]] member Takeshi Hosomi. They defined The Hiatus as \"a project of music, arts, and depicters\" on the band's official site. Izawa was listed as a tour member on the site, and took part in their \"Trash We'd Love Tour 2009\". Izawa also held some concerts with Hosomi as {{Nihongo|\"Hosomi Ichiy\u014d\"|\u7d30\u7f8e\u4e00\u8449}} from October to December.\n\nOn December 2, 2009, Tokyo Jihen released the single \"[[N\u014dd\u014dteki Sanpunkan]]\", their first in two years, and resumed their activity as a band full-time. They appeared as part of the lineup of the December 30, 2009 [[:ja:COUNTDOWN JAPAN|Countdown Japan 09/10]].\n\n=== Final years and dissolution (2010\u20132012) ===\nThe fourth album ''[[Sports (Tokyo Incidents album)|Sports]]'', released on February 24, 2010 won the 1st place in [[Oricon]] chart after an interval of four years. The nationwide tour \"Tokyo Incident live tour 2010 UltraC\" started in March.\n\nThe fifth album ''[[Dai Hakken]]'' was released on June 29, 2011, and the nationwide tour \"Tokyo Incident live tour 2011 Discovery\" started in September 30.\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Ringo Sheena announced their break up on their official site. Their last original release, a mini-album entitled [[Color Bars (Tokyo Jihen Album)|''Color Bars'']], was released on January 18, 2012. A live [[best of album]], [[Tokyo Collection (Tokyo Jihen Album)|''Tokyo Collection'']], and a concert DVD and Blu-ray release of their \"Discovery Tour\" went on sale on February 15. Tokyo Jihen's embarked on a final tour, entitled \"Domestique Bon Voyage''\"'', which included [[Yokohama Arena]] (February 14\u201315), Osaka-jo Hall (February 21\u201322), and Tokyo's Nippon Budokan (February 28\u201329).\n\nThe band officially dissolved on February 29, 2012, after their sold-out final Budokan concert.<ref name=\"Bon Voyage\">After a reported 660,000 applicants for tickets to the tour, approximately 60 times the [[seating capacity]] of the Nippon Budokan, it was decided that the final concert would be simulcast live in 156 movie theaters across Japan, as well as in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Singapore]].</ref> On June 15, an announcement on Sheena's official site, Kronekodow, revealed that Tokyo Jihen would release one final album, ''[[Shin'ya Waku]]''  ''(The Edge of Late Night)'', and DVD/Blu-ray video, ''Chin Play Kou Play'' (''Strange Plays and Great Plays'') in August of that year. The album, a collection of B-sides, included the previously unreleased-on-CD \"Handsome Sugite\" and one new song, \"Tadanaranu Kankei\".

Kameda takes various means, recording a humming and using musical instruments or the PC. Since Ukigumo cannot write a score, Izawa or Sheena (mainly Izawa) copies down his tune in the studio.\n\nHata stubbornly kept refusing to write music, even declining to write lyrics when Sheena asked him to. However, he finally changed his mind.\n\nSince Ukigumo writes music without considering a song, it is hard for Sheena to put the words to his music. That's why he often writes lyrics by himself.\n\n==Concerts and tours==\n\n'''Tours'''\n*[[Live Tour 2005 \"Dynamite!\"|Dynamite!]] (2005)\n*[[Domestic! Virgin Line]] (2006)\n*Domestic!

The salesmen act more as con artists, lying about their identities and circumstances, in selling parcels of land in Florida and Arizona to customers, many of whom are uninterested or unable to afford a real estate investment. They rely on leads, information of potential customers, provided to them by office manager John Williamson ([[Kevin Spacey]]). The leads are purchased by their unseen bosses Mitch and Murray. \n\nA sales meeting is held by Blake ([[Alec Baldwin]]){{mdash}}a salesman \"from downtown\". In a profanity-laden tirade, he chastises the salesmen for their lack of sales and questions their manhood. Blake reveals that, in addition to the month's sale contest (whose winner and first runner-up receive a new Cadillac and a set of steak knives respectively), the bottom two salesmen will be fired. He stresses the mantra \"ABC\u2013Always Be Closing\" and reveals that a valuable set of leads, the \"Glengarry leads\", have arrived, but they will not be distributed to salesmen of their caliber. After Blake leaves, the salesmen split up for the rest of the evening.\n\n'''Levene''':\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene was once a brilliant salesman, but has since fallen into a rut implied to be lasting months, perhaps even years. Adding to Levene's plight is that fact his daughter is sick in the hospital with an unspecified illness. After the others leave, Levene attempts to secure one of the premiere leads from Williamson, who refuses on account of his recent sales record. Levene persists, first charming, then insulting, and finally bribing Williamson by offering him a part of his sales commission. Williamson agrees to 20 percent of the commission plus $50 per lead, but reneges on the deal when Levene is unable to pay upfront. Forced to leave with no good leads, Levene goes cold calling to a customer named Larry Spannel, but fails to close. Throughout the night, Levene is seen conversing on the phone with another lead, a couple named Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.\n\n'''Moss and Aaronow''':\nMoss and Aaronow go out together on an unsuccessful sale. Throughout their trip, an incensed Moss rants to a passive Aaronow about the state of affairs with the company, complaining about the business model where the top leads goes to the most successful salesmen and how Mitch and Murray take 90 percent of their sale. Upon returning to the Chinese restaurant across from the office, Moss proposes that someone strike back against Mitch and Murray by stealing the Glengarry leads and selling them to Jerry Graf, a colleague who has done well in his own business. Aaronow correctly deduces that Moss has indeed discussed an endeavor with Graf. Moss offers to let Aaronow in on the deal, which includes $2,500 and a job with Graf. The latter expresses interest, but balks when Moss tells him he must be the one to break into the office and steal the leads, and it must be done that night. Aaronow tries to remove himself from the topic, but Moss says he is already an accessory to the crime, simply because he listened. \n\n'''Roma''':  \nRichard \"Ricky\" Roma is by far the top salesman in the office. Rather than attend Blake's meeting, Roma instead stays at the Chinese restaurant, where he meets and converses with a timid man named James Lingk. Roma wows Lingk with philosophical monologues and puts him at ease, not once even mentioning real estate until the end of the scene. Convincing Lingk to be more outgoing with his life, Roma presents him literature about land in Florida. \n\n'''Act II'''\nThe next morning, it's revealed the office has been broken into. Leads and the salesmen's phones have been stolen. Police are on the scene and a detective is set to interview each of the salesmen. Roma arrives and pesters Williamson about the status of his latest sales contract, that of James Lingk's. Williamson says it has been filed at the bank, leading Roma to declare himself the winner of the Cadillac, since this sale puts him \"over the top\". Roma further insults Williamson by refusing to act on old leads. He then goes on to ease Aaronow, who is nervous about talking to the detective. \n\nAn overjoyed Levene arrives, announcing he has closed an $82,000 sale with the Nyborgs. While Roma is eager to hear Levene's story, a furious Moss, emerging from his interview with the detective, expresses only vitriol. Roma reminds Moss that he hasn't made a big sale in a month, causing Moss to furiously curse Roma out and storm out of the office, declaring he is \"going to Wisconsin\". Levene finishes his story to Roma, who congratulates him on his sale. \n\nEnergized with the close, Levene demands new leads and insults Williamson, who is left speechless. Roma, seeing Lingk arrive at the office, has Levene pose as his client and tries to usher him off to the airport to avoid a discussion. Lingk reveals that his wife told him to ask for his check back and that she has threatened to call the state's attorney. After a hysterical Aaronow emerges from his interview, Roma tries to put Lingk's mind at ease, eventually convincing him to get a drink and that his check has not been cashed yet. However, the ruse is ruined when Williamson (who erroneously believed that Lingk was worried about whether his check was stolen) claims that the check is already at the bank and has been cashed. A distressed Lingk leaves, causing Roma to launch into a profanity-laden tirade against him before going into his interview. \n\nLevene piles onto Williamson, ending his own rant by telling him \"if you're going to make something up, be sure that it helps\". Williamson realizes that Levene knows that the Lingk contract was still on his desk, something only the one who robbed the office would know. Confronted by Williamson, Levene denies the accusation at first, but eventually reveals he sold the leads to Jerry Graf, working with Moss. When Williamson nonetheless threatens to go to the police, Levene tries once more to charm and bribe his way out of the situation. He offers Williamson his entire cut from the Graf deal, which is rejected. When he offers a bigger cut of his commission, citing his new sale, Williamson reveals that the Nyborgs are mentally ill and unable to afford such pricy real estate and that \"they just like talking to salesmen\". Levene makes one last plea by mentioning his daughter, but Williamson coldly rebuffs him.\n\nUnaware of what's transpired, Roma emerges from his interrogation and praises Levene for his acting during the Lingk situation. He proposes that he and Levene enter business together. As Roma makes a call on a newly installed phone, Levene is called in by the detective. He tries to say something to Roma, who is entrenched in his call. Defeated, Levene walks into the office. While Roma goes off to the restaurant, Aaronow starts making his sales calls.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Richard Roma]]\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Blake\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as George Aaronow\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Dave Moss\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as John Williamson\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as James Lingk\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Larry Spannel\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as the detective\n\n==Production== \nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the <!-- Not 'Royal' until 1988. -->[[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], London. It won the  [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1984. That same year, the play made its [[United States|American]] debut in [[Chicago]] before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to [[New York City]] in 1985 at the suggestion of director [[Irvin Kershner]] who wanted to make it into a film.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\">{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | coauthors = | title = The ''Glengarry'' Math: Add Money and Stars, then Subtract Ego | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/movies/the-talk-of-hollywood-the-glengarry-math-add-money-and-stars-then-subtract-ego.html | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}</ref> Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a [[Washington, D.C.]] based producer of [[B movie]]s who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\n\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian cinema chain, several banks and [[New Line Cinema]] over the course of four years.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/>\n\n[[Al Pacino]] originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]'', in [[London]]. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked [[Jack Lemmon]] to act in the film.<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\">{{cite news | last = Blanchard | first = Jayne M | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry'' Hits the Screen with the Joys of Male Angst | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 27, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. [[Alec Baldwin]], who also attached, left the project over a contract disagreement. [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\".<ref name= \"Hartl, John\">{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | coauthors = | title = Director is Happy to put Big Stars in Film Version of Mamet Play | work = [[Seattle Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 28, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.<ref name= \"production notes\">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' Production Notes | work = [[New Line Cinema]] Press Kit | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\n\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky  remembers, \"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\"<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in [[Los Angeles]]. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, \"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about ''names''\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients \u2013 [[Ed Harris]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] \u2013 soon joined the cast.\n\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> This did not stop other actors, like [[Robert De Niro]], [[Bruce Willis]],<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> [[Richard Gere]], and [[Joe Mantegna]],<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\"/> from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\n\nOnce the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]], and on location in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], over 39 days. Harris remembers: \"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Alan Arkin said of the script, \"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.<ref name= \"Berardinelli, James\">{{cite news | last = Berardinelli | first = James | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = ReelViews | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 2006 | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glengarry_glen.html | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's director of photography, [[Juan Ruiz Anch\u00eda]], relied on low lighting and shadows. A blues, greens, and reds color scheme was used for the first part of the film, while the second half had a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.\n\nDuring the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film.

The salesmen act more as con artists, lying about their identities and circumstances, in selling parcels of land in Florida and Arizona to customers, many of whom are uninterested or unable to afford a real estate investment. They rely on leads, information of potential customers, provided to them by office manager John Williamson ([[Kevin Spacey]]). The leads are purchased by their unseen bosses Mitch and Murray. \n\nA sales meeting is held by Blake ([[Alec Baldwin]]){{mdash}}a salesman \"from downtown\". In a profanity-laden tirade, he chastises the salesmen for their lack of sales and questions their manhood. Blake reveals that, in addition to the month's sale contest (whose winner and first runner-up receive a new Cadillac and a set of steak knives respectively), the bottom two salesmen will be fired. He stresses the mantra \"ABC\u2013Always Be Closing\" and reveals that a valuable set of leads, the \"Glengarry leads\", have arrived, but they will not be distributed to salesmen of their caliber. After Blake leaves, the salesmen split up for the rest of the evening.\n\n'''Levene''':\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene was once a brilliant salesman, but has since fallen into a rut implied to be lasting months, perhaps even years. Adding to Levene's plight is that fact his daughter is sick in the hospital with an unspecified illness. After the others leave, Levene attempts to secure one of the premiere leads from Williamson, who refuses on account of his recent sales record. Levene persists, first charming, then insulting, and finally bribing Williamson by offering him a part of his sales commission. Williamson agrees to 20 percent of the commission plus $50 per lead, but reneges on the deal when Levene is unable to pay upfront. Forced to leave with no good leads, Levene goes cold calling to a customer named Larry Spannel, but fails to close. Throughout the night, Levene is seen conversing on the phone with another lead, a couple named Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.\n\n'''Moss and Aaronow''':\nMoss and Aaronow go out together on an unsuccessful sale. Throughout their trip, an incensed Moss rants to a passive Aaronow about the state of affairs with the company, complaining about the business model where the top leads goes to the most successful salesmen and how Mitch and Murray take 90 percent of their sale. Upon returning to the Chinese restaurant across from the office, Moss proposes that someone strike back against Mitch and Murray by stealing the Glengarry leads and selling them to Jerry Graf, a colleague who has done well in his own business. Aaronow correctly deduces that Moss has indeed discussed an endeavor with Graf. Moss offers to let Aaronow in on the deal, which includes $2,500 and a job with Graf. The latter expresses interest, but balks when Moss tells him he must be the one to break into the office and steal the leads, and it must be done that night. Aaronow tries to remove himself from the topic, but Moss says he is already an accessory to the crime, simply because he listened. \n\n'''Roma''':  \nRichard \"Ricky\" Roma is by far the top salesman in the office. Rather than attend Blake's meeting, Roma instead stays at the Chinese restaurant, where he meets and converses with a timid man named James Lingk. Roma wows Lingk with philosophical monologues and puts him at ease, not once even mentioning real estate until the end of the scene. Convincing Lingk to be more outgoing with his life, Roma presents him literature about land in Florida. \n\n'''Act II'''\nThe next morning, it's revealed the office has been broken into. Leads and the salesmen's phones have been stolen. Police are on the scene and a detective is set to interview each of the salesmen. Roma arrives and pesters Williamson about the status of his latest sales contract, that of James Lingk's. Williamson says it has been filed at the bank, leading Roma to declare himself the winner of the Cadillac, since this sale puts him \"over the top\". Roma further insults Williamson by refusing to act on old leads. He then goes on to ease Aaronow, who is nervous about talking to the detective. \n\nAn overjoyed Levene arrives, announcing he has closed an $82,000 sale with the Nyborgs. While Roma is eager to hear Levene's story, a furious Moss, emerging from his interview with the detective, expresses only vitriol. Roma reminds Moss that he hasn't made a big sale in a month, causing Moss to furiously curse Roma out and storm out of the office, declaring he is \"going to Wisconsin\". Levene finishes his story to Roma, who congratulates him on his sale. \n\nEnergized with the close, Levene demands new leads and insults Williamson, who is left speechless. Roma, seeing Lingk arrive at the office, has Levene pose as his client and tries to usher him off to the airport to avoid a discussion. Lingk reveals that his wife told him to ask for his check back and that she has threatened to call the state's attorney. After a hysterical Aaronow emerges from his interview, Roma tries to put Lingk's mind at ease, eventually convincing him to get a drink and that his check has not been cashed yet. However, the ruse is ruined when Williamson (who erroneously believed that Lingk was worried about whether his check was stolen) claims that the check is already at the bank and has been cashed. A distressed Lingk leaves, causing Roma to launch into a profanity-laden tirade against him before going into his interview. \n\nLevene piles onto Williamson, ending his own rant by telling him \"if you're going to make something up, be sure that it helps\". Williamson realizes that Levene knows that the Lingk contract was still on his desk, something only the one who robbed the office would know. Confronted by Williamson, Levene denies the accusation at first, but eventually reveals he sold the leads to Jerry Graf, working with Moss. When Williamson nonetheless threatens to go to the police, Levene tries once more to charm and bribe his way out of the situation. He offers Williamson his entire cut from the Graf deal, which is rejected. When he offers a bigger cut of his commission, citing his new sale, Williamson reveals that the Nyborgs are mentally ill and unable to afford such pricy real estate and that \"they just like talking to salesmen\". Levene makes one last plea by mentioning his daughter, but Williamson coldly rebuffs him.\n\nUnaware of what's transpired, Roma emerges from his interrogation and praises Levene for his acting during the Lingk situation. He proposes that he and Levene enter business together. As Roma makes a call on a newly installed phone, Levene is called in by the detective. He tries to say something to Roma, who is entrenched in his call. Defeated, Levene walks into the office. While Roma goes off to the restaurant, Aaronow starts making his sales calls.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Richard Roma]]\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Blake\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as George Aaronow\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Dave Moss\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as John Williamson\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as James Lingk\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Larry Spannel\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as the detective\n\n==Production== \nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the <!-- Not 'Royal' until 1988. -->[[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], London. It won the  [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1984. That same year, the play made its [[United States|American]] debut in [[Chicago]] before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to [[New York City]] in 1985 at the suggestion of director [[Irvin Kershner]] who wanted to make it into a film.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\">{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | coauthors = | title = The ''Glengarry'' Math: Add Money and Stars, then Subtract Ego | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/movies/the-talk-of-hollywood-the-glengarry-math-add-money-and-stars-then-subtract-ego.html | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}</ref> Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a [[Washington, D.C.]] based producer of [[B movie]]s who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\n\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian cinema chain, several banks and [[New Line Cinema]] over the course of four years.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/>\n\n[[Al Pacino]] originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]'', in [[London]]. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked [[Jack Lemmon]] to act in the film.<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\">{{cite news | last = Blanchard | first = Jayne M | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry'' Hits the Screen with the Joys of Male Angst | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 27, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. [[Alec Baldwin]], who also attached, left the project over a contract disagreement. [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\".<ref name= \"Hartl, John\">{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | coauthors = | title = Director is Happy to put Big Stars in Film Version of Mamet Play | work = [[Seattle Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 28, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.<ref name= \"production notes\">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' Production Notes | work = [[New Line Cinema]] Press Kit | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\n\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky  remembers, \"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\"<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in [[Los Angeles]]. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, \"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about ''names''\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients \u2013 [[Ed Harris]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] \u2013 soon joined the cast.\n\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> This did not stop other actors, like [[Robert De Niro]], [[Bruce Willis]],<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> [[Richard Gere]], and [[Joe Mantegna]],<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\"/> from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\n\nOnce the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]], and on location in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], over 39 days. Harris remembers: \"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Alan Arkin said of the script, \"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.<ref name= \"Berardinelli, James\">{{cite news | last = Berardinelli | first = James | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = ReelViews | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 2006 | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glengarry_glen.html | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's director of photography, [[Juan Ruiz Anch\u00eda]], relied on low lighting and shadows. A blues, greens, and reds color scheme was used for the first part of the film, while the second half had a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.\n\nDuring the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film.

Among the prominent ones was Giani Partap Singh, an eighty year old spiritual leader and a former Jathedar of the Akal Takht, Partap had openly criticised Bhindranwale for stockpiling firearms and weapons in the Akal Takht. Bhindranwale's  occupation of the Akal Takht was termed as an act of sacrilege. Partap was murdered with gunshot at his home in Tahli Chowk. Several other dissenters were also killed. Niranjan Singh who was the Granthi of Gurudwara Toot Sahib, Granthi Jarnail Singh of Valtoha and Granthi Surat Singh of Majauli were among those killed.

The sacred Golden Temple was being defiled by the militants. An arsenal had been created within the Akal Takht over a period of several months. Trucks that were engaged for ''kar seva'' (religious service) and bringing in supplies needed for the daily langar were used for bringing in guns and ammunition into the Golden Temple. The police failed to check these vehicles, reportedly on instructions from superiors. During a random check, one truck was stopped and many sten guns and large quantity of ammunition was found. After the operation Blue Star, it was found that the militants had even set up a facility to manufacture grenade and to fabricate sten-guns inside the temple complex.

This condition was accepted by the police. At the agreed time he emerged address a large crowd of his followers who armed with spears, swords and several firearms. Several prominent Akali leaders such as [[Gurcharan Singh Tohra]], [[Harchand Singh Longowal]] and the [[Delhi Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee]]'s [[Jathedar]] [[Santokh Singh]] were present. Bhindranwale delivered a fiery sermon inciting the mob against the Government and against the alleged injustices done to the Sikhs and himself. He ended his speech asking the mob not to act violent after his arrest.
