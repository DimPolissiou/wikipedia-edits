He specialised in delicately undercut bas relief and small stand-alone stone sculptures of natural and imaginary flora and fauna on churches and on civic, commercial and domestic buildings. He was apprenticed to his uncle [[Robert Mawer]]. After Mawer's death in 1854 he worked in partnership with his aunt [[Catherine Mawer]] and his cousin [[Charles Mawer]] in the company [[Mawer and Ingle]]. Notable works by Ingle exist on [[Leeds Town Hall]], [[Endcliffe Hall]], [[Sheffield]] and Moorlands House, Leeds. He sometimes exhibited gentle humour in his ecclesiastical work, such as faces peering through greenery, and mischievous humour on secular buildings, such as comic rabbits and frogs among foliage. He died of [[tuberculosis]] at age 41 years, having suffered the disease for two years.\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:William Ingle parents (1).jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone of Ingle's parents]]\nWilliam Ingle (1828 - 25 March 1870)<ref name=\"W.Ingle death cert\" >{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=IQsMp7Felj7V%2B2HV%2BWDvWA&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=23 October 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}} Deaths Mar 1870 Ingle William 41 Leeds vol9b p359.

The group included Robert Mawer, Catherine Mawer, Charles Mawer, Benjamin Payler, Matthew Taylor, and Ingle himself. Unlike the other sculptors in this group, Ingle was never credited by personal name for his work, by contemporary newspapers and other documents; they always referred to the company Mawer and Ingle. He was employed as a sculptor by master sculptor Robert Mawer from about 1849 until Robert Mawer's death in 1854, when Ingle became a master sculptor himself. So long as Ingle was working from the Mawer stoneyard, it produced various carving styles including finely undercut natural vegetation, and natural and comical wildlife and mythical animals. After he died, such natural, realistic elements were no longer produced in the same delicate style, so it is reasonable to suppose that this was Ingle's work. Ingle superintended the stone yard and onsite works under the management of Catherine Mawer after Robert Mawer's death,<ref name=\"Leeds Times 31 Mar 1855\" /> then became a partner in the firm of Mawer & Ingle.<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Deaths |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000686/18700402/169/0012 |via=British Newspaper Archive |newspaper=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencee |location= |date=2 April 1870 |page=12 |access-date=13 March 2019}} \"Ingle, March 25 1870, aged 41, Mr William Ingle, of the firm of Messrs Mawer & Ingle, stone carvers, Great George Street, Leeds.\"</ref>\n\n[[Leeds Civic Trust]] arranged to unveil two [[blue plaque]]s At the [[Henry Moore Foundation|Henry Moore Institute]] on 11 July 2019, commemorating the work of Robert Mawer, Catherine Mawer and William Ingle, besides the Mawer Group as a whole.

He specialised in delicately undercut bas relief and small stand-alone stone sculptures of natural and imaginary flora and fauna on churches and on civic, commercial and domestic buildings. He was apprenticed to his uncle [[Robert Mawer]]. After Mawer's death in 1854 he worked in partnership with his aunt [[Catherine Mawer]] and his cousin [[Charles Mawer]] in the company [[Mawer and Ingle]]. Notable works by Ingle exist on [[Leeds Town Hall]], [[Endcliffe Hall]], [[Sheffield]] and Moorlands House, Leeds. He sometimes exhibited gentle humour in his ecclesiastical work, such as faces peering through greenery, and mischievous humour on secular buildings, such as comic rabbits and frogs among foliage. He died of [[tuberculosis]] at age 41 years, having suffered the disease for two years.\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:William Ingle parents (1).jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone of Ingle's parents]]\nWilliam Ingle (1828 - 25 March 1870)<ref name=\"W.Ingle death cert\" >{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=IQsMp7Felj7V%2B2HV%2BWDvWA&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=23 October 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}} Deaths Mar 1870 Ingle William 41 Leeds vol9b p359.

The group included Robert Mawer, Catherine Mawer, Charles Mawer, Benjamin Payler, Matthew Taylor, and Ingle himself. Unlike the other sculptors in this group, Ingle was never credited by personal name for his work, by contemporary newspapers and other documents; they always referred to the company Mawer and Ingle. He was employed as a sculptor by master sculptor Robert Mawer from about 1849 until Robert Mawer's death in 1854, when Ingle became a master sculptor himself. So long as Ingle was working from the Mawer stoneyard, it produced various carving styles including finely undercut natural vegetation, and natural and comical wildlife and mythical animals. After he died, such natural, realistic elements were no longer produced in the same delicate style, so it is reasonable to suppose that this was Ingle's work. Ingle superintended the stone yard and onsite works under the management of Catherine Mawer after Robert Mawer's death,<ref name=\"Leeds Times 31 Mar 1855\" /> then became a partner in the firm of Mawer & Ingle.<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Deaths |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000686/18700402/169/0012 |via=British Newspaper Archive |newspaper=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencee |location= |date=2 April 1870 |page=12 |access-date=13 March 2019}} \"Ingle, March 25 1870, aged 41, Mr William Ingle, of the firm of Messrs Mawer & Ingle, stone carvers, Great George Street, Leeds.\"</ref>\n\n[[Architecture of Leeds#Leeds Civic Trust|Leeds Civic Trust]] arranged to unveil two [[blue plaque]]s At the [[Henry Moore Foundation|Henry Moore Institute]] on 11 July 2019, commemorating the work of Robert Mawer, Catherine Mawer and William Ingle, besides the Mawer Group as a whole.

The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan's age. Mondale criticized Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply-side economic policies]] and budget deficits, and he called for a [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear freeze]] and ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].\n\nReagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states, becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election. Reagan's showing ranks [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|fifth]] in the share of electoral votes received and [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|fifth]] in the share of the popular vote won.  No candidate since 1984 has equaled Reagan's share of the electoral vote, although his popular vote was eventually surpassed by Bush in 2004 (62 million) and subsequent candidates. Mondale received 40.6% of the popular vote, but carried only the [[District of Columbia]] and his home state of [[Minnesota]].

Initially, Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], after a failed bid to win the 1980 Democratic nomination for president, was considered the ''de facto'' front-runner of the 1984 primary.  However, Kennedy announced in December 1982 that he did not intend to run.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/01/us/kennedy-reported-declining-to-seek-presidency-in-1984.html</ref><ref>https://www.newsweek.com/why-kennedy-withdrew-1984-race-207040</ref> Former Vice-President Mondale was then viewed as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.  Mondale had the largest number of party leaders supporting him, and he had raised more money than any other candidate. However, both Jackson and Hart emerged as surprising, and troublesome, opponents.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator [[Ernest Hollings]]'s wit and experience, as well as his call for a [[budget freeze]], won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by [[Walter Mondale]], [[John Glenn]], and [[Gary Hart]].  Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in New Hampshire and endorsed Hart a week later.  His disdain for his competitors was at times showcased in his comments. He notably referred to Mondale as a \"lapdog,\" and to former astronaut Glenn as \"[[Sky King]]\" who was \"confused in his capsule.\"<ref>Skipper, John C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3z7bGzNHIO0C&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=hollings+glenn+%22sky+king%22&source=bl&ots=IutNbIr2Zg&sig=SvY8lM3CSDm9qCr9Y6ucA4arl9c&hl=en&ei=x5I4TbmBCsGugQf0l4DzCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hollings%20glenn%20%22sky%20king%22&f=false The Iowa Caucuses: First Tests of Presidential Aspiration, 1972\u20132008], pg. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nCalifornia Senator [[Alan Cranston]] hoped to galvanize supporters of the nuclear freeze movement that had called on the United States to halt the deployment of existing nuclear weapons and the development of new ones.\nGlenn and Askew hoped to capture the support of moderate and conservative Democrats. None of them possessed the fundraising ability of Mondale nor the grassroots support of Hart and Jackson, and none won any contests.\n\nJackson was the second [[African-American]] (after [[Shirley Chisholm]]) to mount a nationwide campaign for the presidency, and he was the first African-American candidate to be a serious contender.  He got 3.5 million votes during the primaries, third behind Hart and Mondale.  He won the primaries in Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana, and split Mississippi, where there were two separate contests for Democratic delegates.  Through the primaries, Jackson helped confirm the black electorate's importance to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in the South at the time.  During the campaign, however, Jackson made an off-the-cuff reference to [[Jew]]s as \"Hymies\" and [[New York City]] as \"Hymietown,\" for which he later apologized.  Nonetheless, the remark was widely publicized, and derailed his campaign for the nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm|title=Jesse Jackson's 'Hymietown' Remark \u2013 1984|newspaper=Washington Post|author=Larry J. Sabato's Feeding Frenzy | date=July 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>  Jackson ended up winning 21% of the national primary vote but received only 8% of the delegates to the national convention, and he initially charged that his campaign was hurt by the same party rules that allowed Mondale to win.  He also poured scorn on Mondale, saying that [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the \"last significant politician out of the St. Paul-Minneapolis\" area.<ref name=\"ThomasTime1984\">{{Cite news |last=Thomas |first=Evan |last2=Allis |first2=Sam |last3=Beckwith |first3=David |date=July 2, 1984 |title=Trying to Win the Peace |newspaper=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html }}</ref>\n\nHart, from Colorado, was a more serious threat to Mondale, and after winning several early primaries it looked as if he might take the nomination away from Mondale. Hart finished a surprising second in the [[Iowa caucuses]], with 16.5% of the vote. This established him as the main rival to Mondale, effectively eliminating John Glenn, Ernest Hollings and Alan Cranston as alternatives.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Hart criticized Mondale as an \"old-fashioned\" [[New Deal]] Democrat who symbolized \"failed policies\" of the past.  Hart positioned himself (just as [[Bill Clinton]] would eight years later) as a younger, fresher, and more moderate Democrat who could appeal to younger voters.  He emerged as a formidable candidate, winning the key New Hampshire, Ohio, and California primaries as well as several others, especially in the West.  However, Hart could not overcome Mondale's financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.\n\nHart was also badly hurt in a televised debate with Mondale during the primaries, when the former vice president used a popular television commercial slogan to ridicule Hart's vague \"New Ideas\" platform. Turning to Hart on camera, Mondale told Hart that whenever he heard Hart talk about his \"New Ideas,\" he was reminded of the [[Wendy's]] fast-food slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\"  The remark drew loud laughter and applause from the viewing audience and caught Hart off-guard.  Hart never fully recovered from Mondale's charge that his \"New Ideas\" were shallow and lacking in specifics.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|left|Mondale celebrates several victories in March 13 primaries with [[Jimmy Carter]] (under whom Mondale had previously served as vice president) at his campaign headquarters.]]\nAt a roundtable debate between the three remaining Democratic candidates moderated by [[Phil Donahue]], Mondale and Hart got into such a heated argument over the issue of U.S. policy in Central America that Jackson had to tap his water glass on the table to help get them to stop.\n\nMondale gradually pulled away from Hart in the delegate count, but, as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported in late May, \"Mondale ... has a wide lead in total delegates (1,564 to 941) ... because of his victories in the big industrial states, his support from the Democratic Establishment and the arcane provisions of delegate-selection rules that his vanguard helped draft two years ago.\"<ref>Kurt Andersen, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951089,00.html? \"A Wild Ride to the End\"], ''Time'', May 28, 1984</ref>  After the final primary in California, on June 5, which Hart won, Mondale was about 40 delegates short of the total he needed for the nomination.<ref>Ruth Marcus, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011502863.html \"Parsing Tsunami Tuesday\"], ''Washington Post'', January 16, 2008</ref> However, at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]] on July 16, Mondale received the overwhelming support of the unelected [[superdelegate]]s from the party establishment to win the nomination.\n\nMondale's nomination marked the second time since the nomination of former [[Governor of Georgia]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and the fourth time since the nomination of former Representative [[John W. Davis]] in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominated a private citizen for [[President of the United States|President]] (i.e., not serving in an official government role at the time of the nomination and election). Mondale was the last private citizen to be nominated for President by the Democratic Party until former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].\n\nThis race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination was the closest in two generations, and, as of 2017, it was the last occasion that a major party's race for the presidential nomination went all the way to its convention.\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n'''Note:''' These are only those endorsements which occurred during or before the primary race.\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left; border:0; margin-top:0.2em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cff; font-weight:normal;\"|\n'''List of Walter Mondale endorsements'''\n|-\n| style=\"border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white;\"|\nMondale had received endorsements from:\n;United States House of Representatives\n* Representative [[Jim Bates (politician)|Jim Bates]] of [[California]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=18370 |title=Candidate \u2013 Jim Bates |publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n* Representative [[Edward Boland]] of [[Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n* Representative [[Rick Boucher]] of [[Virginia]]<ref name=DPrim>{{cite web| url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55208| work=Our Campaigns| title=US President \u2013 D Primaries \u2013 Feb 01, 1984| date=February 7, 2008| accessdate=March 7, 2008}}</ref>\n* Representative [[Joseph D.

Mondale wanted to establish a precedent with his vice presidential candidate; although [[Tonie Nathan]] of the [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] had already figured as an Electoral-College candidate for vice-president ([[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]), Ferraro would become the first woman to receive votes from all the electors of [[Minnesota|a state]]. Another reason for the nominee to \"go for broke\" instead of [[balancing the ticket]] was Reagan's lead in the polls.  Mondale hoped to appeal to women, and by 1980, they were the majority of voters. In a \"much criticized parade of possible Veep candidates\" to his home in Minnesota, Mondale considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Martha Layne Collins]], also female; Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and San Antonio Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Hispanic, as other finalists for the nomination.

Anderson|John Anderson's]] presidential campaign from the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]]. Anderson hoped that the party would be able to challenge the \"two old parties\", which he viewed as being tied to various special interest groups and incapable of responsible fiscal reform. The intention was to organize the new party in California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, the New England states, and others where his previous candidacy had proven to have experienced the most success. The party was also eligible for $5.8 million in Federal election funds, but its qualification depended on it being on the ballot in at least ten states; however, it remained unclear if National Unity could actually obtain the funds, or if it needed to be Anderson himself.\n\nAnderson initially was against running, hoping that another notable politico would take the party into the 1984 election, and feared that his own candidacy might result in the party being labeled a \"personality cult\". However, no candidate came forward resulting in Anderson becoming the nominee in waiting. While Anderson had found equal support from the Republicans and Democrats in the 1980 election, the grand majority of the former had since switched back, resulting in the new party being supported principally by those who normally would vote Democratic, which it was feared might make him a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler candidate]]. In light of this, in addition to difficulties in getting on the ballot in his targeted states ''(Utah and Kentucky were the only two, neither among those he intended to prominently campaign in)'', Anderson ultimately declined to run. Later he would endorse the Democratic nominee, [[Walter Mondale]].\n\nAnderson had hoped that the party would continue to grow and later field a candidate in 1988 ''(which he declared would not be him)'', but it floundered and ultimately dissolved.\n\n=== Libertarian Party nomination ===\n* [[David Bergland]], Party Chairman from [[California]]\n* [[Gene Burns]], [[talk radio]] host from [[Florida]] ''(withdrew \u2013 August 26, 1983)''<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dU4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VM8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3911,4640110&dq=gene-burns+radio&hl=en</ref>\n* [[Tonie Nathan]], 1972 vice presidential nominee from [[Oregon]] ''(declined to contest)''\n* [[Earl Ravenal]], foreign policy analyst, academic, and writer from [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[Mary Ruwart]], research scientist from [[Texas]]\n\nBurns was the initial frontrunner for the nomination, but withdrew, citing concerns that the party would not be able to properly finance a campaign. The remaining candidates were Bergland; Ravenal, who had worked in the Department of Defense under [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Clark Clifford]]; and Ruwart. Bergland narrowly won the presidential nomination over Ravenal. His running mate was [[James A. Lewis]]. The ticket appeared on 39 state ballots.\n\n=== Citizens Party nomination ===\n[[Sonia Johnson]] ran in the 1984 presidential election, as the presidential candidate of the [[Citizens Party (United States)|Citizens Party]], Pennsylvania's Consumer Party and California's [[Peace and Freedom Party]]. Johnson received 72,161 votes (0.1%) finishing fifth. Her running mate for the Citizens Party was [[Richard Walton]] and for the Peace and Freedom Party [[Emma Wong Mar]]. One of her campaign managers, Mark Dunlea, later wrote a novel about a first female president, ''Madame President''.\n\n=== Communist Party nomination ===\nThe [[Communist Party USA]] ran [[Gus Hall]] for president and [[Angela Davis]] for vice president.\n\n== General election ==\n\n=== Campaign ===\n[[File:Candidates Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro campaigning at Ft. Lauderdale, 4-27-84..jpg|thumb|left|Mondale and Ferraro campaigning in Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\n\nMondale ran a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against what he considered to be unfairness in Reagan's economic policies and the need to reduce federal [[budget deficit]]s.\n\nWhile Ferraro's choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22% of women were pleased about her selection, versus 18% who agreed that it was a bad idea. 60% of all voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision, versus 22% who believed that he had chosen the best available candidate.{{r|time19840723}} Some members of the hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] criticized the Catholic Ferraro for being [[pro-choice]] on abortion. Already fighting an uphill battle with voters, Ferraro also faced a slew of allegations, mid-campaign, directed toward her husband, [[John Zaccaro]]. These allegations included Zaccaro's possible past involvement in organized crime, pornography distribution, and campaign contribution violations. Ferraro responded to these allegations against her husband by releasing her family tax returns to the media on August 21, 1984. However, the damage to the campaign was already done.{{r|martin20110327}}\n\n[[File:President Reagan and Vice President Bush at a rally at Auditorium Shores in Austin Texas.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan and Bush campaigning in Austin, Texas]]\nAt a campaign stop in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]], Reagan said, \"America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire, New Jersey's [[Bruce Springsteen]].\" The Reagan campaign briefly used \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\", a song criticizing the treatment of [[Vietnam War]] veterans (which they mistakenly thought was devoid of anti-war content and a very jingoistic patriotic rock song), as a campaign song, without permission, until Springsteen, a lifelong Democrat, insisted that they stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1014|title=Born In The U.S.A. by Bruce Springsteen Songfacts|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Reagan campaign was very skilled at producing effective television advertising. Two of the more memorable ads it produced were commonly known as \"[[Bear in the woods]]\" and \"[[Morning in America]]\".\n\n[[File:Reagan answers question about age 2nd debate of 1984.webm|thumb|right|Clip from the second debate in which Reagan responds to a question about his age]]\nReagan was the oldest president to have ever served (he was by this point 73), and there were many questions about his capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency, particularly after Reagan had a poor showing in his first debate with Mondale on October 7.

Roosevelt]].  Mondale's defeat was also the worst for any Democratic Party candidate in American history in the Electoral College (and his 13 electoral votes the fewest any Democrat has won since [[Stephen A. Douglas]] claimed 12 in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]], when the Democratic vote was divided), though others, including [[Alton B. Parker]], [[James M.

They characterized such Reagan Democrats as southern whites and northern blue collar workers who voted for Reagan because they credited him with the economic recovery, saw Reagan as strong on national security issues, and perceived the Democrats as supporting the poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class. The [[Democratic National Committee]] commissioned a study after the election that came to these conclusions, but suppressed the report, afraid that it would offend its key voters.{{r|prendergast1999}}\n\n[[File:Reagan receiving concession call from Walter MondaleC25679-5.jpg|thumb|right|Reagan receiving a [[Concession (politics)|concession]] call from Mondale]]\nWhen Reagan was asked in December 1984 what he wanted for Christmas he joked, \"Well, Minnesota would have been nice\".<ref name=\"ap19841204\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ATQdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m6UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4591%2C2286313 |title=Minnesota heads Reagan's wish list |work=The Tuscaloosa News |date=December 4, 1984 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |page=27}}</ref> Reagan lost Minnesota in both this election and in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], making it the only state he failed to win in either election, and also making him the first two-term president not to carry Minnesota since [[Woodrow Wilson]].

The Reagan campaign produced effective television advertising and deftly neutralized concerns regarding Reagan's age. Mondale criticized Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply-side economic policies]] and budget deficits, and he called for a [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear freeze]] and ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].\n\nReagan won 58.8% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states, becoming the oldest person to win a presidential election. Reagan's showing ranks [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|fifth]] in the share of electoral votes received and [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|fifth]] in the share of the popular vote won.  No candidate since 1984 has equaled Reagan's share of the electoral vote, although his popular vote was eventually surpassed by Bush in 2004 (62 million) and subsequent candidates. Mondale received 40.6% of the popular vote, but carried only the [[District of Columbia]] and his home state of [[Minnesota]].

Initially, Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], after a failed bid to win the 1980 Democratic nomination for president, was considered the ''de facto'' front-runner of the 1984 primary.  However, Kennedy announced in December 1982 that he did not intend to run.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/01/us/kennedy-reported-declining-to-seek-presidency-in-1984.html</ref><ref>https://www.newsweek.com/why-kennedy-withdrew-1984-race-207040</ref> Former Vice-President Mondale was then viewed as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.  Mondale had the largest number of party leaders supporting him, and he had raised more money than any other candidate. However, both Jackson and Hart emerged as surprising, and troublesome, opponents.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator [[Ernest Hollings]]'s wit and experience, as well as his call for a [[budget freeze]], won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by [[Walter Mondale]], [[John Glenn]], and [[Gary Hart]].  Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in New Hampshire and endorsed Hart a week later.  His disdain for his competitors was at times showcased in his comments. He notably referred to Mondale as a \"lapdog,\" and to former astronaut Glenn as \"[[Sky King]]\" who was \"confused in his capsule.\"<ref>Skipper, John C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3z7bGzNHIO0C&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=hollings+glenn+%22sky+king%22&source=bl&ots=IutNbIr2Zg&sig=SvY8lM3CSDm9qCr9Y6ucA4arl9c&hl=en&ei=x5I4TbmBCsGugQf0l4DzCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hollings%20glenn%20%22sky%20king%22&f=false The Iowa Caucuses: First Tests of Presidential Aspiration, 1972\u20132008], pg. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nCalifornia Senator [[Alan Cranston]] hoped to galvanize supporters of the nuclear freeze movement that had called on the United States to halt the deployment of existing nuclear weapons and the development of new ones.\nGlenn and Askew hoped to capture the support of moderate and conservative Democrats. None of them possessed the fundraising ability of Mondale nor the grassroots support of Hart and Jackson, and none won any contests.\n\nJackson was the second [[African-American]] (after [[Shirley Chisholm]]) to mount a nationwide campaign for the presidency, and he was the first African-American candidate to be a serious contender.  He got 3.5 million votes during the primaries, third behind Hart and Mondale.  He won the primaries in Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana, and split Mississippi, where there were two separate contests for Democratic delegates.  Through the primaries, Jackson helped confirm the black electorate's importance to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in the South at the time.  During the campaign, however, Jackson made an off-the-cuff reference to [[Jew]]s as \"Hymies\" and [[New York City]] as \"Hymietown,\" for which he later apologized.  Nonetheless, the remark was widely publicized, and derailed his campaign for the nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm|title=Jesse Jackson's 'Hymietown' Remark \u2013 1984|newspaper=Washington Post|author=Larry J. Sabato's Feeding Frenzy | date=July 21, 1998 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>  Jackson ended up winning 21% of the national primary vote but received only 8% of the delegates to the national convention, and he initially charged that his campaign was hurt by the same party rules that allowed Mondale to win.  He also poured scorn on Mondale, saying that [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the \"last significant politician out of the St. Paul-Minneapolis\" area.<ref name=\"ThomasTime1984\">{{Cite news |last=Thomas |first=Evan |last2=Allis |first2=Sam |last3=Beckwith |first3=David |date=July 2, 1984 |title=Trying to Win the Peace |newspaper=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html }}</ref>\n\nHart, from Colorado, was a more serious threat to Mondale, and after winning several early primaries it looked as if he might take the nomination away from Mondale. Hart finished a surprising second in the [[Iowa caucuses]], with 16.5% of the vote. This established him as the main rival to Mondale, effectively eliminating John Glenn, Ernest Hollings and Alan Cranston as alternatives.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Hart criticized Mondale as an \"old-fashioned\" [[New Deal]] Democrat who symbolized \"failed policies\" of the past.  Hart positioned himself (just as [[Bill Clinton]] would eight years later) as a younger, fresher, and more moderate Democrat who could appeal to younger voters.  He emerged as a formidable candidate, winning the key New Hampshire, Ohio, and California primaries as well as several others, especially in the West.  However, Hart could not overcome Mondale's financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.\n\nHart was also badly hurt in a televised debate with Mondale during the primaries, when the former vice president used a popular television commercial slogan to ridicule Hart's vague \"New Ideas\" platform. Turning to Hart on camera, Mondale told Hart that whenever he heard Hart talk about his \"New Ideas,\" he was reminded of the [[Wendy's]] fast-food slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\"  The remark drew loud laughter and applause from the viewing audience and caught Hart off-guard.  Hart never fully recovered from Mondale's charge that his \"New Ideas\" were shallow and lacking in specifics.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|left|Mondale celebrates several victories in March 13 primaries with [[Jimmy Carter]] (under whom Mondale had previously served as vice president) at his campaign headquarters.]]\nAt a roundtable debate between the three remaining Democratic candidates moderated by [[Phil Donahue]], Mondale and Hart got into such a heated argument over the issue of U.S. policy in Central America that Jackson had to tap his water glass on the table to help get them to stop.\n\nMondale gradually pulled away from Hart in the delegate count, but, as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported in late May, \"Mondale ... has a wide lead in total delegates (1,564 to 941) ... because of his victories in the big industrial states, his support from the Democratic Establishment and the arcane provisions of delegate-selection rules that his vanguard helped draft two years ago.\"<ref>Kurt Andersen, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951089,00.html? \"A Wild Ride to the End\"], ''Time'', May 28, 1984</ref>  After the final primary in California, on June 5, which Hart won, Mondale was about 40 delegates short of the total he needed for the nomination.<ref>Ruth Marcus, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011502863.html \"Parsing Tsunami Tuesday\"], ''Washington Post'', January 16, 2008</ref> However, at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]] on July 16, Mondale received the overwhelming support of the unelected [[superdelegate]]s from the party establishment to win the nomination.\n\nMondale's nomination marked the second time since the nomination of former [[Governor of Georgia]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and the fourth time since the nomination of former Representative [[John W. Davis]] in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominated a private citizen for [[President of the United States|President]] (i.e., not serving in an official government role at the time of the nomination and election). Mondale was the last private citizen to be nominated for President by the Democratic Party until former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].\n\nThis race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination was the closest in two generations, and, as of 2017, it was the last occasion that a major party's race for the presidential nomination went all the way to its convention.\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n'''Note:''' These are only those endorsements which occurred during or before the primary race.\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left; border:0; margin-top:0.2em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cff; font-weight:normal;\"|\n'''List of Walter Mondale endorsements'''\n|-\n| style=\"border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white;\"|\nMondale had received endorsements from:\n;United States House of Representatives\n* Representative [[Jim Bates (politician)|Jim Bates]] of [[California]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=18370 |title=Candidate \u2013 Jim Bates |publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n* Representative [[Edward Boland]] of [[Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" />\n* Representative [[Rick Boucher]] of [[Virginia]]<ref name=DPrim>{{cite web| url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55208| work=Our Campaigns| title=US President \u2013 D Primaries \u2013 Feb 01, 1984| date=February 7, 2008| accessdate=March 7, 2008}}</ref>\n* Representative [[Joseph D.

Mondale wanted to establish a precedent with his vice presidential candidate; although [[Tonie Nathan]] of the [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian Party]] had already figured as an Electoral-College candidate for vice-president ([[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]), Ferraro would become the first woman to receive votes from all the electors of [[Minnesota|a state]]. Another reason for the nominee to \"go for broke\" instead of [[balancing the ticket]] was Reagan's lead in the polls.  Mondale hoped to appeal to women, and by 1980, they were the majority of voters. In a \"much criticized parade of possible Veep candidates\" to his home in Minnesota, Mondale considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Martha Layne Collins]], also female; Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and San Antonio Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Hispanic, as other finalists for the nomination.

Anderson|John Anderson's]] presidential campaign from the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]]. Anderson hoped that the party would be able to challenge the \"two old parties\", which he viewed as being tied to various special interest groups and incapable of responsible fiscal reform. The intention was to organize the new party in California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, the New England states, and others where his previous candidacy had proven to have experienced the most success. The party was also eligible for $5.8 million in Federal election funds, but its qualification depended on it being on the ballot in at least ten states; however, it remained unclear if National Unity could actually obtain the funds, or if it needed to be Anderson himself.\n\nAnderson initially was against running, hoping that another notable politico would take the party into the 1984 election, and feared that his own candidacy might result in the party being labeled a \"personality cult\". However, no candidate came forward resulting in Anderson becoming the nominee in waiting. While Anderson had found equal support from the Republicans and Democrats in the 1980 election, the grand majority of the former had since switched back, resulting in the new party being supported principally by those who normally would vote Democratic, which it was feared might make him a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler candidate]]. In light of this, in addition to difficulties in getting on the ballot in his targeted states ''(Utah and Kentucky were the only two, neither among those he intended to prominently campaign in)'', Anderson ultimately declined to run. Later he would endorse the Democratic nominee, [[Walter Mondale]].\n\nAnderson had hoped that the party would continue to grow and later field a candidate in 1988 ''(which he declared would not be him)'', but it floundered and ultimately dissolved.\n\n=== Libertarian Party nomination ===\n* [[David Bergland]], Party Chairman from [[California]]\n* [[Gene Burns]], [[talk radio]] host from [[Florida]] ''(withdrew \u2013 August 26, 1983)''<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dU4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VM8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3911,4640110&dq=gene-burns+radio&hl=en</ref>\n* [[Tonie Nathan]], 1972 vice presidential nominee from [[Oregon]] ''(declined to contest)''\n* [[Earl Ravenal]], foreign policy analyst, academic, and writer from [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[Mary Ruwart]], research scientist from [[Texas]]\n\nBurns was the initial frontrunner for the nomination, but withdrew, citing concerns that the party would not be able to properly finance a campaign. The remaining candidates were Bergland; Ravenal, who had worked in the Department of Defense under [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Clark Clifford]]; and Ruwart. Bergland narrowly won the presidential nomination over Ravenal. His running mate was [[James A. Lewis]]. The ticket appeared on 39 state ballots.\n\n=== Citizens Party nomination ===\n[[Sonia Johnson]] ran in the 1984 presidential election, as the presidential candidate of the [[Citizens Party (United States)|Citizens Party]], Pennsylvania's Consumer Party and California's [[Peace and Freedom Party]]. Johnson received 72,161 votes (0.1%) finishing fifth. Her running mate for the Citizens Party was [[Richard Walton]] and for the Peace and Freedom Party [[Emma Wong Mar]]. One of her campaign managers, Mark Dunlea, later wrote a novel about a first female president, ''Madame President''.\n\n=== Communist Party nomination ===\nThe [[Communist Party USA]] ran [[Gus Hall]] for president and [[Angela Davis]] for vice president.\n\n== General election ==\n\n=== Campaign ===\n[[File:Candidates Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro campaigning at Ft. Lauderdale, 4-27-84..jpg|thumb|left|Mondale and Ferraro campaigning in Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\n\nMondale ran a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against what he considered to be unfairness in Reagan's economic policies and the need to reduce federal [[budget deficit]]s.\n\nWhile Ferraro's choice was popular among Democratic activists, polls immediately after the announcement showed that only 22% of women were pleased about her selection, versus 18% who agreed that it was a bad idea. 60% of all voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision, versus 22% who believed that he had chosen the best available candidate.{{r|time19840723}} Some members of the hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] criticized the Catholic Ferraro for being [[pro-choice]] on abortion. Already fighting an uphill battle with voters, Ferraro also faced a slew of allegations, mid-campaign, directed toward her husband, [[John Zaccaro]]. These allegations included Zaccaro's possible past involvement in organized crime, pornography distribution, and campaign contribution violations. Ferraro responded to these allegations against her husband by releasing her family tax returns to the media on August 21, 1984. However, the damage to the campaign was already done.{{r|martin20110327}}\n\n[[File:President Reagan and Vice President Bush at a rally at Auditorium Shores in Austin Texas.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan and Bush campaigning in Austin, Texas]]\nAt a campaign stop in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]], Reagan said, \"America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire, New Jersey's [[Bruce Springsteen]].\" The Reagan campaign briefly used \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\", a song criticizing the treatment of [[Vietnam War]] veterans (which they mistakenly thought was devoid of anti-war content and a very jingoistic patriotic rock song), as a campaign song, without permission, until Springsteen, a lifelong Democrat, insisted that they stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1014|title=Born In The U.S.A. by Bruce Springsteen Songfacts|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Reagan campaign was very skilled at producing effective television advertising. Two of the more memorable ads it produced were commonly known as \"[[Bear in the woods]]\" and \"[[Morning in America]]\".\n\n[[File:Reagan answers question about age 2nd debate of 1984.webm|thumb|right|Clip from the second debate in which Reagan responds to a question about his age]]\nReagan was the oldest president to have ever served (he was by this point 73), and there were many questions about his capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency, particularly after Reagan had a poor showing in his first debate with Mondale on October 7.

Roosevelt]].  Mondale's defeat was also the worst for any Democratic Party candidate in American history in the Electoral College (and his 13 electoral votes the fewest any Democrat has won since [[Stephen A. Douglas]] claimed 12 in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]], when the Democratic vote was divided), though others, including [[Alton B. Parker]], [[James M. Cox]], [[John W. Davis]], and [[George S. McGovern]], did worse in the popular vote.\n\n[[Psephology|Psephologists]] attributed the Republican victory to \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\", millions of Democrats who voted for Reagan, as in 1980. They characterized such Reagan Democrats as southern whites and northern blue collar workers who voted for Reagan because they credited him with the economic recovery, saw Reagan as strong on national security issues, and perceived the Democrats as supporting the poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class. The [[Democratic National Committee]] commissioned a study after the election that came to these conclusions, but suppressed the report, afraid that it would offend its key voters.{{r|prendergast1999}}\n\n[[File:Reagan receiving concession call from Walter MondaleC25679-5.jpg|thumb|right|Reagan receiving a [[Concession (politics)|concession]] call from Mondale]]\nWhen Reagan was asked in December 1984 what he wanted for Christmas he joked, \"Well, Minnesota would have been nice\".<ref name=\"ap19841204\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ATQdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m6UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4591%2C2286313 |title=Minnesota heads Reagan's wish list |work=The Tuscaloosa News |date=December 4, 1984 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |page=27}}</ref> Reagan lost Minnesota in both this election and in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], making it the only state he failed to win in either election, and also making him the first two-term president not to carry Minnesota since [[Woodrow Wilson]].

The cars are manufactured by hand in [[Bratislava]]. Attack was officially launched in May 2002,<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/supertest-k1-roadster-694330.html Autobild.de web site - Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung (german)]</ref> but was in development since 1999. The car was originally made for racing, developed by Engineer Dick Kvetnansky and designed by Juraj Mitra and was completed in 2000. The car was built initially as a race car, upon seeing the demand as a road car the car was made available as a kit car using the 90-93 Honda Accord as the donor car. Small modifications could be made to accommodate the H22 engine from the Honda Prelude as well.\n\n==History==\nIn May 2002, K-1 Engineering presented the Attack Roadster at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA - International Automobile Exhibition).<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/vorstellung-attack-von-k1-43867.html Autobild.de web site - Attacke auf Elise (german)]</ref> Powered by a mid-mounted 3.0 L (2 967 ccm) Ford Mondeo ST220<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/vorstellung-attack-von-k1-43867.html Autobild.de web site - Attacke auf Elise (german)]</ref> V6 engine, producing 242 PS (178&nbsp;hp) at 7000 rpm, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission gearbox sending power to the rear wheels. The Attack could accelerate to 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 5.2 seconds.<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/supertest-k1-roadster-694330.html Autobild.de web site - Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung (german)]</ref> Top speed was electronically limited to 155.4&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h).\n\nIn 2003 a K-1 Attack was donated by Mr. Dick Kvetnansky to a development team of high school students in the west Philadelphia Learning Academy and was the only Attack with a full carbon fiber body. The team of students was led by the Engineer-teacher Simon Hauger, their ultimate goal was to build \"The World's first Hybrid Supercar\".  In 2004, the project was completed and won an International fuel efficiency competition in 2005, beating out Billion dollar car manufacturers like Honda, Toyota and even Tesla. In 2006 it again competed and won, sweeping the competition. The car was capable of a 0 - 60 mph time in 3.5 seconds, and gave a mileage up to 68 miles per gallon. The rear wheels of the car were powered by a Volkswagen GTI Diesel engine that was modified to run on soybean oil and there were plans to power the front wheels by an AC Propulsion electric motor and then later by an Azure motor but this was never completed. The car was not only super-fast and economical, but was also eco-friendly (pollution free), thereby achieving its goal. According to the fuel efficiency competition, the car was given a wide media coverage by TV channels like the Discovery Channel, ABC, NBC, CABLE TV, and various  car magazines. The car is now located in Beverly Hills and owned by Prince Fuad Abdallah Haboud Camanero Faresi .\n\nIn 2008, a K-1 Attack was modified by car racer Aljosa Tushek from Slovenia, who got the body modified by Oliver Ashley he also added a luxury interior and an Audi 4.2 liter V8 engine from the Audi RS series delivering {{Convert|450|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7900 rpm and {{Convert|315|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at just 3,200 rpm. Tushek called it the \"Renovatio T500 Tushek\". It debuted at the Top Marques Monaco in April 2012 and then at the Salon Prive, UK in September 2012. There was also a production version by Ford, available only in Europe.\n\nSomewhere between 20 and 40 were produced and exported to the United States by K-1 Engineering before production ceased. The kit was plagued by poor support, lack of assembly instructions and an extremely difficult build process due to ill-conceived design aspects. In 2011 B-Racing was born and gained the rights and tooling to begin manufacturing again.  Since then countless improvements, refinements and available upgrades have been made including several options for using different donor cars. Pricing has also dropped from the original $20K to less than $10K making the kit very affordable.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:K1 Attack.jpg| K1 Attack at the IAA 2003\nFile:K1 Attack cockpit.jpg|Attack cockpit\nFile:Attack K1 Innenraum.JPG|Attack cockpit 2\nFile:Asanti Attack K1 - Flickr - exfordy (1).jpg| Attack back-view\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.b-racing.cz/en B-Racing current manufacturer of K1 Attack kit cars]\n* [http://www.topspeed.com/cars/prototypes/k-1-attack-roadster-ar35882.html  K-1 Attack Roadster Video at the topspeed.com]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxr4xjZ1T8s  The World's 1st Hybrid Supercar built on a K-1 Attack base]\n* [http://www.attackforums.com  K1 Attack Forum]\n\n{{Automotive industry in Slovakia}}\n\n[[Category:Roadsters]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:First car made by manufacturer]]\n[[Category:Cars of Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Notability|Products|date=November 2012}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=November 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = K1 Attack vr EMS.jpg\n| name = K-1 Attack Roadster\n| manufacturer = [[K-1 Engineering]], now [[B-Racing]]\n| production = 2002&ndash;present\n| assembly = [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]\n| class = [[Sports car]]\n| body_style = 2-seat [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]\n| layout = [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| platform = \n| engine = Ford Mondeo ST220 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]]\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2440|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4040|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1860|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1095|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|992|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = \n| designer = Juraj Mitra\n}}\n\nThe ''' K-1 Attack Roadster''' is a [[sports car]] built by the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] car company [[K-1 Engineering]]. The cars are manufactured by hand in [[Bratislava]]. Attack was officially launched in May 2002,<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/supertest-k1-roadster-694330.html Autobild.de web site - Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung (german)]</ref> but was in development since 1999. The car was originally made for racing, developed by Engineer Dick Kvetnansky and designed by Juraj Mitra and was completed in 2000. The car was built initially as a race car, upon seeing the demand as a road car the car was made available as a kit car using the 90-93 Honda Accord as the donor car. Small modifications could be made to accommodate the H22 engine from the Honda Prelude as well.\n\n==History==\nIn May 2002, K-1 Engineering presented the Attack Roadster at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] (IAA - International Automobile Exhibition).<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/vorstellung-attack-von-k1-43867.html Autobild.de web site - Attacke auf Elise (german)]</ref> Powered by a mid-mounted 3.0 L (2 967 ccm) Ford Mondeo ST220<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/vorstellung-attack-von-k1-43867.html Autobild.de web site - Attacke auf Elise (german)]</ref> V6 engine, producing 242 PS (178&nbsp;hp) at 7000 rpm, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission gearbox sending power to the rear wheels. The Attack could accelerate to 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 5.2 seconds.<ref>[http://www.autobild.de/artikel/supertest-k1-roadster-694330.html Autobild.de web site - Angriff ist die beste Verteidigung (german)]</ref> Top speed was electronically limited to 155.4&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h).\n\nIn 2003 a K-1 Attack was donated by Mr. Dick Kvetnansky to a development team of high school students in the west Philadelphia Learning Academy and was the only Attack with a full carbon fiber body. The team of students was led by the Engineer-teacher Simon Hauger, their ultimate goal was to build \"The World's first Hybrid Supercar\".  In 2004, the project was completed and won an International fuel efficiency competition in 2005, beating out Billion dollar car manufacturers like Honda, Toyota and even Tesla.

It is a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] auxiliary route of [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]], running roughly through the center of the [[San Diego\u2013Tijuana metropolitan area|Greater San Diego region]] from [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] (part of the city of [[San Diego]]) near the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexico\u2013U.S. border]] to near [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]]. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes through the San Diego neighborhoods of [[North Park, San Diego|North Park]], [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]], [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], and [[University City, San Diego|University City]] before terminating at I-5 in the [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego|Sorrento Valley]] neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.\n\nPlanning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the '''Jacob Dekema Freeway''' after the longtime head of the regional division of the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the '''Mission Valley Viaduct'''. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I-5. [[High-occupancy toll]] lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-805 Northbound at CA 905.jpg|thumb|left|I-805 northbound at SR&nbsp;905]]\nThe route begins at [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] near the Mexican border in a far south part of [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]], a neighborhood of [[San Diego]]. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with [[California State Route 905|State Route&nbsp;905]] (SR&nbsp;905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]].<ref name=\"gmaps\" /> Within the past 20&nbsp;years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista; those on the eastern side of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side.<ref>{{cite news | title=A City Divided\u2014by Interstate 805\u2014Chula Vista, and Its Schools, Face Serious Threat of East Versus West | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=February 7, 2004 | author=Moran, Chris | page=B1|oclc=25257675}}</ref> Just outside the city, I-805 meets [[County Route S17 (California)|County Route S17]] (CR&nbsp;S17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with [[California State Route 54|SR&nbsp;54]].

As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets [[California State Route 15|SR&nbsp;15]], the continuation of [[Interstate 15|I-15]]. It then intersects [[El Cajon Boulevard]] before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue.<ref name=\"gmaps\" /> The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in [[Southern California]]. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] [[concrete viaduct]] built in 1972, spanning over [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]] and the [[San Diego River]].<ref name=\"Caltrans\">{{CA Named Freeways | pages=85, 212, 225}}</ref> The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over [[Interstate 8|I-8]], which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical [[stack interchange]]. The [[San Diego Trolley]] traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor.<ref name=\"gmaps\" />\n\n[[File:Interstate 805-5 Split.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of I-805 south at I-5 during the evening rush hour]]\nAfter intersecting [[California State Route 163|SR&nbsp;163]], also known as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets [[California State Route 52|SR&nbsp;52]] in [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont Mesa]]. North of SR&nbsp;52, it closely parallels I-5 near [[La Jolla]], heading northwest.

It is a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] auxiliary route of [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]], running roughly through the center of the [[San Diego\u2013Tijuana metropolitan area|Greater San Diego region]] from [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] (part of the city of [[San Diego]]) near the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexico\u2013U.S. border]] to near [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]]. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes through the San Diego neighborhoods of [[North Park, San Diego|North Park]], [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]], [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], and [[University City, San Diego|University City]] before terminating at I-5 in the [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego|Sorrento Valley]] neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.\n\nPlanning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the '''Jacob Dekema Freeway''' after the longtime head of the regional division of the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the '''Mission Valley Viaduct'''. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I-5. [[High-occupancy toll]] lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-805 Northbound at CA 905.jpg|thumb|left|I-805 northbound at SR&nbsp;905]]\nThe route begins at [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] near the Mexican border in a far south part of [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]], a neighborhood of [[San Diego]].

As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets [[California State Route 15|SR&nbsp;15]], the continuation of [[Interstate 15|I-15]]. It then intersects [[El Cajon Boulevard]] before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue.<ref name=\"gmaps\" /> The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in [[Southern California]]. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] [[concrete viaduct]] built in 1972, spanning over [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]] and the [[San Diego River]].<ref name=\"Caltrans\">{{CA Named Freeways | pages=85, 212, 225}}</ref> The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over [[Interstate 8|I-8]], which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical [[stack interchange]].

Patrons from all positions of power sought to build their power through the control of clients and resources. More and more patronage extended over entire communities whether on the basis of political decree, benefaction by an individual who becomes the communities' patron, or by the community formally adopting a patron.<ref name=\":2\" /> Both sides had expectations of one another, the community expected protection from outside forces while the patron expected a loyal following for things such as political campaigning and manpower should the need arise. The extent of a person's client relationships was often taken into account when looking for an expression of their potential political power.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPatronage in the late empire differed from patronage in the republic. Patrons protected individual clients from the tax collector and other public obligations. In return, clients gave them money or services. Some clients even surrendered ownership of their land to their patron. The emperors were unable to prevent this type of patronage effectively.<ref>Oxford Classical Dictionary \"patronus\"</ref> The significance of ''clientela'' changed along with the social order during [[late antiquity]].

In return, the patron was expected to ensure a certain degree of material security for their client. Allowing one's clients to become [[destitute]] or entangled in unjust legal proceedings would reflect poorly on the patron and diminish their prestige.\n\n==Changing Nature of Patronage==\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Maecenas Presenting the Liberal Arts - 1743.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] of one of [[Augustus]]' political advisers presenting him the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

Patrons from all positions of power sought to build their power through the control of clients and resources. More and more patronage extended over entire communities whether on the basis of political decree, benefaction by an individual who becomes the communities' patron, or by the community formally adopting a patron.<ref name=\":2\" /> Both sides had expectations of one another, the community expected protection from outside forces while the patron expected a loyal following for things such as political campaigning and manpower should the need arise. The extent of a person's client relationships was often taken into account when looking for an expression of their potential political power.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPatronage in the late empire differed from patronage in the republic. Patrons protected individual clients from the tax collector and other public obligations. In return, clients gave them money or services. Some clients even surrendered ownership of their land to their patron. The emperors were unable to prevent this type of patronage effectively.<ref>Oxford Classical Dictionary \"patronus\"</ref> The significance of ''clientela'' changed along with the social order during [[late antiquity]]. By the 10th century, ''clientela'' meant a contingent of armed retainers ready to enforce their [[lord]]'s will.

This can be seen in Caesar\u2019s relations with the [[Aedui]] of [[Gaul]] wherein he was able to restore their influence over the other Gallic tribes whom where once their clients.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}The Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}\n\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

In 1971, the PRC replaced the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as \"Taiwan\" since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004).

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134. Accessed 22 April 2006.</ref> The EAS, which includes [[ASEAN Plus Three]], [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of \"[[China's peaceful development]]\". Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}\n\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

In 1971, the PRC replaced the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as \"Taiwan\" since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004).

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of \"[[China's peaceful development]]\". Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

When Cooper retired from the glue business in 1865, he sold the factory to his family members. In 1878, the factory moved again to Smith Island in [[Newtown Creek]]. It eventually left Brooklyn for good in the 20th century. In 1895, the descendants of Peter Cooper sold the site glue factory on Maspeth Avenue to The City of Brooklyn for $55,000.

In 1838, he relocated the factory to Maspeth Avenue in Brooklyn. It was a strategic site that could access roads connecting to New York-bound ferries and [[Long Island]] farms. When Cooper retired from the glue business in 1865, he sold the factory to his family members. In 1878, the factory moved again to Smith Island in [[Newtown Creek]]. It eventually left Brooklyn for good in the 20th century. In 1895, the descendants of Peter Cooper sold the site glue factory on Maspeth Avenue to The City of Brooklyn for $55,000. From there, the City would clear out the site and build Cooper Park.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Late 19th Century ==\nIn 1898, Cooper Park showed evidence of a lack of nourishing soil.
