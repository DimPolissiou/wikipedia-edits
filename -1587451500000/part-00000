[[U.S. Highway 66 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 66]] also passed through the city.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Amarillo, Texas}}\nLarge ranches exist in the Amarillo area: among others, the defunct [[XIT Ranch]] and the still functioning [[JA Ranch]] founded in 1877 by [[Charles Goodnight]] and [[John George Adair]]. Goodnight continued the partnership for a time after Adair's death with Adair's widow, [[Cornelia Adair|Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair]], who was then the sole owner from 1887 until her death in 1921.\n\nDuring April 1887, J.I. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and [[Colorado City, Texas]], merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the [[county seat]] election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the [[railroad]] and [[freight]] service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing [[cattle]]-marketing center.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nThe settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo, which probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (''Amarillo'' is the Spanish word for the color yellow). Early residents originally pronounced the city's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|a\u02d0|m|\u0259|\u02c8|r|i\u02d0|j|o\u028a}} {{respell|ah-m\u0259|REE|yoh}}, which was later displaced by the current pronunciation.<ref>Hammond, Clara T., comp.

The city became a [[grain elevator]], milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s.

Thompson instituted a major capital-improvements project and worked to reduce utility rates. He joined the [[Railroad Commission of Texas|Texas Railroad Commission]] by appointment in 1933 and was elected to full terms in 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, and 1958. He became an international expert on national petroleum and natural gas production and conservation. The first Mrs. Thompson, [[May Peterson Thompson]], a former [[Metropolitan Opera]] singer, was involved in the arts while in Amarillo and later when the couple lived in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].\n\nAmarillo was hit by the [[Dust Bowl]] and entered an [[Great Depression|economic depression]]. [[U.S. Routes]] 60, 87, 287, and 66 intersected at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops. World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nIn 1949, a deadly F4 tornado devastated much of Amarillo, shortly after nightfall on May 15, tearing through the south and east sides of the city, killing seven people, and injuring more than 80 others. The tornado touched down southwest of Amarillo, near the town of Hereford, then tracked its way northward, on a collision course with Amarillo. The tornado, shortly after 8 pm, ripped through Amarillo's most densely populated areas, demolishing almost half of the city, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\nIn 1951, the army air base was reactivated as [[Amarillo Air Force Base]] and expanded to accommodate a [[Strategic Air Command]] [[B-52 Stratofortress]] wing.<ref>{{cite web |author= Amarillo Economic Development Corporation |url= http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 |title= Community History |accessdate= January 28, 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060116220406/http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 |archivedate= January 16, 2006 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression.

It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas. It is situated in the grasslands of Northern Texas, and is surrounded by dense prairie.  Amarillo is infamous for its unpredictable weather patterns, with massive temperature changes on a daily basis, raging winds, devastating hailstorms and \"northers\", long periods of drought, late frosts, spring tornadoes, dust-storms, and floods. Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have occurred over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[Denver|Colorado]] state capitals than it does to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The region's surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in [[playa lake]]s.<ref name=\"tx_pan\"/> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|90.3|sqmi|km2}}, with {{convert|89.9|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it (0.50%) covered by water.

The average annual precipitation is {{convert|20.4|in|mm|disp=or}}. Much of Amarillo's precipitation falls during heavy convective showers and thunderstorms during the late spring and summer months. According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Amarillo averages 48 days per year during which thunder and lightning is reported. This is above the national average. These storms can be severe: Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated in the western portion of \"[[Tornado Alley]]\" and are prone to severe weather events, occurring primarily between April and July. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging straight-line winds, large hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding. Amarillo is no stranger to devastating tornadoes. Tornadoes have occurred in and around the city in 1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 2001, 2007, and most recently in 2013, 2015 and 2016. The strongest tornado to ever hit Amarillo was a deadly F4 tornado that struck the city in the night time hours of May 15, 1949. Amarillo suffered a direct hit, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life in Amarillo's most densely populated areas. The tornado devastated the south and east sides of the city, killing 7 people, and injuring more than 80 others. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|37.0|\u00b0F|1}} in January to {{convert|78.3|\u00b0F|1}} in July. Sunny weather prevails year-round, with nearly 3300 hours of bright sunshine annually. The [[National Weather Service Amarillo, Texas|National Weather Service in Amarillo]] forecasts and provides climatic data for the city.\n\nExtreme temperatures range from {{convert|\u221216|\u00b0F|1}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 12, 1899]] to {{convert|111|\u00b0F|1}} on June 26, 2011, but lows do not typically lower to {{convert|0|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}} in most years, while highs above {{convert|100|\u00b0F|C|1|disp=or}} are seen on 4.7 days on average. On average, there are 5.9 days of lows at or below {{convert|10|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}}, 8.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing, and 61 days of {{convert|90|\u00b0F|1}}+ highs. Unlike in the Rio Grande Valley or eastern portions of Texas, days where the low does not fall below {{convert|70|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}} are relatively rare, due to the aridity and elevation. Blizzards are very possible, but snowfall is typically light, averaging nearly {{convert|18|in|m|2|disp=or}} seasonally and the median figure is near {{convert|10|in|m|2|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite news

[[U.S. Highway 66 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 66]] also passed through the city.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Amarillo, Texas}}\nLarge ranches exist in the Amarillo area: among others, the defunct [[XIT Ranch]] and the still functioning [[JA Ranch]] founded in 1877 by [[Charles Goodnight]] and [[John George Adair]]. Goodnight continued the partnership for a time after Adair's death with Adair's widow, [[Cornelia Adair|Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair]], who was then the sole owner from 1887 until her death in 1921.\n\nDuring April 1887, J.I. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and [[Colorado City, Texas]], merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the [[county seat]] election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the [[railroad]] and [[freight]] service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing [[cattle]]-marketing center.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nThe settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo, which probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (''Amarillo'' is the Spanish word for the color yellow). Early residents originally pronounced the city's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|a\u02d0|m|\u0259|\u02c8|r|i\u02d0|j|o\u028a}} {{respell|ah-m\u0259|REE|yoh}}, which was later displaced by the current pronunciation.<ref>Hammond, Clara T., comp.

The city became a [[grain elevator]], milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s.

Thompson instituted a major capital-improvements project and worked to reduce utility rates. He joined the [[Railroad Commission of Texas|Texas Railroad Commission]] by appointment in 1933 and was elected to full terms in 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, and 1958. He became an international expert on national petroleum and natural gas production and conservation. The first Mrs. Thompson, [[May Peterson Thompson]], a former [[Metropolitan Opera]] singer, was involved in the arts while in Amarillo and later when the couple lived in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].\n\nAmarillo was hit by the [[Dust Bowl]] and entered an [[Great Depression|economic depression]]. [[U.S. Routes]] 60, 87, 287, and 66 intersected at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops. World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nIn 1949, a deadly F4 tornado devastated much of Amarillo, shortly after nightfall on May 15, tearing through the south and east sides of the city, killing seven people, and injuring more than 80 others. The tornado touched down southwest of Amarillo, near the town of Hereford, then tracked its way northward, on a collision course with Amarillo. The tornado, shortly after 8 pm, ripped through Amarillo's most densely populated areas, demolishing almost half of the city, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\nIn 1951, the army air base was reactivated as [[Amarillo Air Force Base]] and expanded to accommodate a [[Strategic Air Command]] [[B-52 Stratofortress]] wing.<ref>{{cite web |author= Amarillo Economic Development Corporation |url= http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 |title= Community History |accessdate= January 28, 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060116220406/http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 |archivedate= January 16, 2006 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression.

It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas. It is situated in the grasslands of Northern Texas, and is surrounded by dense prairie.  Amarillo is infamous for its unpredictable weather patterns, with massive temperature changes on a daily basis, raging winds, devastating hailstorms and \"northers\", long periods of drought, late frosts, spring tornadoes, dust-storms, and floods. Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have occurred over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[Denver|Colorado]] state capitals than it does to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The region's surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in [[playa lake]]s.<ref name=\"tx_pan\"/> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|90.3|sqmi|km2}}, with {{convert|89.9|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it (0.50%) covered by water.

The average annual precipitation is {{convert|20.4|in|mm|disp=or}}. Much of Amarillo's precipitation falls during heavy convective showers and thunderstorms during the late spring and summer months. According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Amarillo averages 48 days per year during which thunder and lightning is reported. This is above the national average. These storms can be severe: Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated in the western portion of \"[[Tornado Alley]]\" and are prone to severe weather events, occurring primarily between April and July. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging straight-line winds, large hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding. Amarillo is no stranger to devastating tornadoes. Tornadoes have occurred in and around the city in 1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 2001, 2007, and most recently in 2013, 2015 and 2016. The strongest tornado to ever hit Amarillo was a deadly F4 tornado that struck the city in the night time hours of May 15, 1949. Amarillo suffered a direct hit, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life in Amarillo's most densely populated areas. The tornado devastated the south and east sides of the city, killing 7 people, and injuring more than 80 others. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|37.0|\u00b0F|1}} in January to {{convert|78.3|\u00b0F|1}} in July. Sunny weather prevails year-round, with nearly 3300 hours of bright sunshine annually. The [[National Weather Service Amarillo, Texas|National Weather Service in Amarillo]] forecasts and provides climatic data for the city.\n\nExtreme temperatures range from {{convert|\u221216|\u00b0F|1}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 12, 1899]] to {{convert|111|\u00b0F|1}} on June 26, 2011, but lows do not typically lower to {{convert|0|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}} in most years, while highs above {{convert|100|\u00b0F|C|1|disp=or}} are seen on 4.7 days on average. On average, there are 5.9 days of lows at or below {{convert|10|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}}, 8.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing, and 61 days of {{convert|90|\u00b0F|1}}+ highs. Unlike in the Rio Grande Valley or eastern portions of Texas, days where the low does not fall below {{convert|70|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}} are relatively rare, due to the aridity and elevation. Blizzards are very possible, but snowfall is typically light, averaging nearly {{convert|18|in|m|2|disp=or}} seasonally and the median figure is near {{convert|10|in|m|2|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite news

As Armenian is the only known language of its branch of the [[Indo-European languages]], the [[comparative method]] cannot be used to reconstruct its earlier stages. Instead, a combination of [[internal reconstruction|internal]] and external reconstruction, by reconstructions of [[Proto-Indo-European]] and other branches, has allowed linguists to piece together the earlier history of Armenian.\n\n==Definition==\nProto-Armenian, as the common ancestor of only one language, has no clear definition of the term. It is generally held to include a variety of ancestral stages of Armenian between Proto-Indo-European and the earliest attestations of [[Classical Armenian]].\n\nIt is thus not a [[proto-language]] in the strict sense, but \"Proto-Armenian\" is a term that has become common in the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe earliest testimony of Armenian is the 5th-century [[Bible]] translation of [[Mesrop Mashtots]]. The earlier history of the language is unclear and the subject of much speculation. It is clear that Armenian is an Indo-European language, but its development is opaque.  Modern research suggests it made up a distinct speech community already by the late 3rd millennium BC.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn any case, Armenian has many layers of [[loanword]]s and shows traces of long [[language contact]] with [[Anatolian languages]] such as [[Luwian language|Luwian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]],  [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurrio-Urartian]] languages, [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Aramaic]], and [[Iranian languages]] such as [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Parthian language|Parthian]]. Armenian also has influence to a lesser extent from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://armenianlanguage.org/etymology/etymology.html}}</ref>\n\n==Phonological development of Proto-Armenian==\nThe Proto-Armenian sound changes are varied and eccentric (such as ''*dw-'' yielding ''erk-'') and, in many cases, uncertain. That prevented Armenian from being immediately recognized as an Indo-European branch in its own right, and it was assumed to be simply a very divergent [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] until [[Heinrich H\u00fcbschmann]] established its independent character in 1874.<ref>[[Karl Brugmann]], ''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Seite\ua789Brugmann_Grundriss_der_vergleichenden_Grammatik_der_indogermanischen_Sprachen_vol._1_1897_(part_1).djvu/053 Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen]'' (1897) ''Das Armenische (II), fr\u00fcher f\u00e4lschlicherweise f\u00fcr iranisch ausgegeben, von H.

As Armenian is the only known language of its branch of the [[Indo-European languages]], the [[comparative method]] cannot be used to reconstruct its earlier stages. Instead, a combination of [[internal reconstruction|internal]] and external reconstruction, by reconstructions of [[Proto-Indo-European]] and other branches, has allowed linguists to piece together the earlier history of Armenian.\n\n==Definition==\nProto-Armenian, as the common ancestor of only one language, has no clear definition of the term. It is generally held to include a variety of ancestral stages of Armenian between Proto-Indo-European and the earliest attestations of [[Classical Armenian]].\n\nIt is thus not a [[proto-language]] in the strict sense, but \"Proto-Armenian\" is a term that has become common in the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe earliest testimony of Armenian is the 5th-century [[Bible]] translation of [[Mesrop Mashtots]]. The earlier history of the language is unclear and the subject of much speculation. It is clear that Armenian is an Indo-European language, but its development is opaque.  Modern research suggests it made up a distinct speech community already by the late 3rd millennium BC.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn any case, Armenian has many layers of [[loanword]]s and shows traces of long [[language contact]] with [[Anatolian languages]] such as [[Luwian language|Luwian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]],  [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurrio-Urartian]] languages, [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Aramaic]], and [[Iranian languages]] such as [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Parthian language|Parthian]]. Armenian also has influence to a lesser extent from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://armenianlanguage.org/etymology/etymology.html}}</ref>\n\n==Phonological development of Proto-Armenian==\nThe Proto-Armenian sound changes are varied and eccentric (such as ''*dw-'' yielding ''erk-'') and, in many cases, uncertain. That prevented Armenian from being immediately recognized as an Indo-European branch in its own right, and it was assumed to be simply a very divergent [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] until [[Heinrich H\u00fcbschmann]] established its independent character in 1874.<ref>[[Karl Brugmann]], ''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Seite\ua789Brugmann_Grundriss_der_vergleichenden_Grammatik_der_indogermanischen_Sprachen_vol._1_1897_(part_1).djvu/053 Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen]'' (1897) ''Das Armenische (II), fr\u00fcher f\u00e4lschlicherweise f\u00fcr iranisch ausgegeben, von H.

The early history of the region can be dated back to the fifth century A.D. T.Kallupatti and Chinnakattalai are among the few places in South India with Iron Age historical remains of copper and gold.

Due to this, it is considered a rural hub. The [[Western Ghats]] reach to the western, northeastern and southwestern sides of the town. Due to its proximity to the Western Ghats, the town has a cooler average temperature than that of the city of Madurai and other eastern areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/ |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Madurai'''\n|Northeast = [[Madurai]] \n|Northwest = [[Western Ghats]] \n|North     = [[Usilampatti]]\n|West      = [[Peraiyur]]\n|Centre    = T.Kallupatti\n|East      = [[Virudhunagar]]\n|Southwest = [[Western Ghats]]\n|South     = [[Rajapalayam]]\n|Southeast = [[Sivakasi]]\n}}\n\n===Towns with initials: the concept of a mother village===\nThe town has an initial similar to that of a person, something which is, in fact, a common feature of towns in Southern Tamil Nadu. The initial for Kallupatti comes from the name of the mother village from which it derives its existence. The form is similar to that between a mother and her children, a convention which was a feature of the original Tamil culture for years. T.Kallupatti's mother village is [[Devankuruchi]] (spelled as Thevankurichi), a small village on the road towards [[Peraiyur]]. The Devankurichi hill is a symbol of spirituality, one which is visible while driving near to T.Kallupatti. Many people throng to the Agneeswaran Temple of Devankurichi in order to perform the last rites of those who are dead and so it is equated to Kasi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilhindu.com/2010/02/devankurichi-hill-temple/ |title=\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043f\u0417\u0440\u043e\u2561\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0425\u0440\u043f\u0411\u0440\u043e\u2592\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u042a\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u042a\u0440\u043e\u2510 \u2013 \u0440\u043e\u042a\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u2592\u0440\u043f\u0411\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0440\u043e\u2593\u0440\u043f\u0418\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u2593\u0440\u043f\u041d \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043f\u0416\u0440\u043e\u2591\u0440\u043f\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043f\u0416\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u2561\u0440\u043e\u0429\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0425\u0440\u043e\u2502\u0440\u043f\u041d &#124; \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u2524\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u2563\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043f\u0411 |publisher=Tamilhindu.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Community===\nT.Kallupatti is a symbol of mixed culture. \n\nAll communities contribute equally to the total population of the town and the people of Kallupatti live in harmony, which is not the case in other villages of south Tamil Nadu, where caste-related violence is common.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Brahmin population has been eroded, though they were once dominant in the community.\n\nThe Christian population in the town has increased recently to a significant number. Dalits of the area are well educated and settled except for a small group.\n\nNotable locations within this historical place include Eazhoor (seven villages); the Muthalamman Temple; the Devankurichi Temple; the Gandhi Niketan Ashram; the Rural Extension Training Centre (RETC) and the District Institutions of Education and Training (called the teacher-training school),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikieducator.org/Diet_roles_and_functions |title=Diet roles and functions |publisher=WikiEducator |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref> along with government hospitals, etc.\n\nBefore Indian independence, T.Kallupatti acted as a hub for meetings and discussions among freedom fighters. The town was visited by many national freedom fighters and political leaders.\n\n===Temples and festivals===\nThe Madurai District has an endless list of towns with special religious practices and T.Kallupatti is not far behind in this regard. Among the nearby temples are:\n*The Agneeswaran(SHIVA LINGA) Umadevi (PARVATHI) hill temple at Easwaraberi Thevanturichi.\n*The Muthalamman (Women Goddess) Temple Festival: a famous Temple Festival celebrated once in two years between seven villages around T.Kallupatti.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinamalar.com/News_Detail.asp?Id=120608 |title=\u0b8f\u0bb4\u0bc1 \u0b8a\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b85\u0bae\u0bcd\u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbe: \u0bb2\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0ba3\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0ba9 \u0baa\u0b95\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0ba9\u0bb0\u0bcd |publisher=Dinamalar |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref> It is one of the rare festivals which does nor have any caste issues and for which everyone comes together to help the celebrations. This is a major shift from the caste-related violence during the Temple festivals in Tamil Nadu and the Southern districts in particular. The festival involves each of the seven villages preparing their own Sapparam for their goddess. [[Vannivelampatti]] comes close to competing with T.Kallupatti Sapparam in terms of importance. The festival comes a few days before or after Deepavali.\n*The Mariamman Temple Festival is a yearly festival involving Tamil traditions.

The history of this practice goes back over five hundred years to when the Karaikeni ruler Arasuthevar decided to resolve a dispute between two other small rulers. His decision was that there should be a military contest to decide the winner. One of the rulers and his army was destroyed but one warrior escaped. His descendants come together every two years to celebrate this festival. Now the festival involves a fight between groups dressed in typical, traditional Tamil garb, which includes the [[Silambu]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Published: Saturday, 28 February 2009, 14:22 [IST] |url=http://thatstamil.oneindia.in/art-culture/essays/2009/0228-unique-festival-near-madurai.html |title=\u0b87\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bb3 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbe..! &#124; Unique festival near Madurai, \u0bae\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bc8 \u0b85\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bc7 \u0ba8\u0b9f\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bb3 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbe - Tamil Oneindia |publisher=Thatstamil.oneindia.in |date=2009-02-28 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinamani.com/edition/story.aspx?%26SectionName%3DEdition-Madurai%26artid%3D130812%26SectionID%3D137%26MainSectionID%3D137%26SEO%3D%26Title%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002013443/http://www.dinamani.com/edition/story.aspx?&SectionName=Edition-Madurai&artid=130812&SectionID=137&MainSectionID=137&SEO=&Title= |archivedate=2011-10-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\n*[[Tamil language|Tamil]]\n*[[Telugu language|Telugu]]\n\n==Gandhiniketan Ashram==\nAn important place to visit in T.Kallupatti is the Gandhiniketan Ashram.\nWhen one travels from [[Madurai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] along the highway leading to [[Coutrallam]], past the famous waterfalls, what comes strikingly into view at the fortieth kilometre is the Gandhi Niketan Ashram: one of the few surviving Gandhian Institutions in India, still vibrant with Gandhian thoughts and ideals. On entering the campus of this institution, which is located in a sprawling 40 acres of land, one can feel the peace and tranquility that pervades the place.\n\n===Formation===\nGandhi Niketan Ashram, which has a long history and rich tradition behind it, is the brain-child of Freedom fighter G. Venkatachalapathy (\"The Architect of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Movement in Tamil Nadu\") and was started in 1940 to help create an independent India and reconstruct the type of rural India envisioned by [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]].\n\n===After independence===\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, the Gandhi Niketan Ashram was involved in areas like community development, panchayati raj, and khadi and village industries.  Development officials and activists from all over India were trained here to work at a grassroots level. The Ashram also played a key role in the Bhoodan movement spearheaded by [[Acharya Vinoba Bhave]].\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], the Nobel laureate and civil rights leader of America, visited the founder of the Madras twice and obtained a first-hand account of the experiences of Venkatachalapathy in organizing Satyagraha and constructive programmes. [[E. F. Schumacher]], one of the founders of the Green Movement in the west and renowned author of the book ''Small is Beautiful'' visited the Ashram in 1962 and obtained valuable insights into the areas of appropriate technology for the benefit of the rural poor. Schumacher was later seen as an adviser for the Indian planning commission in the early 1970s.\n\n===Objectives===\n*To implement the Gandhian vision of Gram Swaraj by promoting constructive training, demonstration and development programmes.\n*To enable the villagers to produce their own clothing by spinning and weaving with hand-spun yarn.\n*To promote an appropriate educational system suited to rural realities based on the Gandhian concept of Basic Education.\n*To eradicate the evil of untouchability and to propagate Adult Literacy.\n*To train rural people to keep their villages clean.\n*To improve agricultural practices and to teach villagers to produce nutritive food grains.\n*To educate people on the dangers of alcoholism and wean them away from liquor.\n*To achieve all of the above in order to create a village reconstruction army.\n\n=== e-Learning at Gandhiniketan Ashram ===\nAn ambitious programme to introduce computer-aided learning and interactive curriculum support in 1,000 rural schools in the country was launched here in 2008. The e-learning/digital content programme was launched by former President [[A P J Abdul Kalam]] at the Gandhi Niketan Ashram School. The initiative helps students clarify their doubts while sitting in their class. Schools are given the infrastructure required for IT-based education which includes animation and interactive tools for various projects at the high/higher secondary school level. \n<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blnus/27021405.htm/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Public administration and rural development==\n{{See also|Madurai District}}\nThe T.Kallupatti Block comprises about 42 Villages and is one of the more effectively administered rural blocks of the state. There is 100% electricity coverage in all villages. Protected Water Supply is available in all villages under the Block. The Male to Female Ratio is 1000-1001, which shows a major shift from [[Usilampatti]] Block (just 20&nbsp;km away) where female infanticide is high. Forty-four per cent of women are employed, which constitutes a diverse workforce. Sixty-five per cent depend on agriculture. MicroFinance and illegal money lending are uncommon in the Block as there are 15 Agriculture Cooperative Banks. All 42 Villages are Panchayats and 39 of the 42 are Revenue Villages. There are 88 Child Welfare Centres with most of them concentrated in the town of T.Kallupatti and these are well connected by village roads. Although Peraiyur is the [[Taluk]], the Central Location of T.Kallupatti and its being on the NH 208 provided it with an advantage in development and so [[Peraiyur]] comes under the T.Kallupatti block as a revenue firka.\n\n===T.Kallupatti Block===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Density of population per km<sup>2</sup> || 319\n|-\n| Percentage of urban population to total Population || 22.69\n|-\n| Number of females per 1000 males || 1001 \n|-\n| Percentage of workers to total population || 51.12\n|-\n| Percentage of female workers to total workers || 44.24 \n|-\n| Percentage of agricultural workers to total workers || 67.46 \n|-\n| Percentage of gross cropped area to net area sown || 99.54 \n|-\n| Bovine population per km<sup>2</sup> || 50.23\n|-\n| Percentage of villages electrified || 100%\n|-\n| Percentage of villages covered by prot. water supply || 100%\n|-\n| No. of police stations || 3\n|-\n| No. of noon meal centres || 88\n|}\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madurai.tn.nic.in/kallupatti.htm |title=Madurai - T Kallupatti Block |publisher=Madurai.tn.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Sustainable development===\nAt T. Kallupatti, 35 street lights, seven sodium vapour lamps at a bus stand, and a motor pumpset of 7.5 horsepower used for an overhead tank are powered by a [[biomass]] gasifier unit. The unit of 12 KVA (kilovolt ampere) generates 220 units a day at a mere Rs.500. The bus stand and a nearby park are lit up round the clock, even in times of load shedding.\n\n====Biomass power generation method====\nThe unit is fuelled completely by Julia Flora, a plant known as Seemakaruvellai (Thorny tree). A feasibility study for the project showed that the plant was available in abundance in the locality. This was critical to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project. Self-help groups supply the wood, which is dried in the sun for 10 days and then chopped into pieces. The progress of the unit is closely monitored. \nThe advantages of biomass power generation method include:\n* Reduction in the emission of carbon and in soil erosion.\n* Provision of a means of restoring degraded land.\n* Reuse of residues from the raw materials of wood, bagasse, rice husk and other agricultural materials. These can be used to generate heat and electricity for agricultural and industrial processes.\n* Short-rotation of wood species, including [[casuarina]], which is used to fuel the biomass units.\n\nBy harvesting crop in rotation, a standing plantation of 250 hectares will grow 10,000 tonnes of casuarina, which is sufficient to generate 1 megawatt. A 2,500-hectare casuarina energy plantation could support a plant of 10-12 MW.\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/23/stories/2008122354720500.htm |title=Archive News |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Police station===\nT.Kallupatti police stations are present in mother villages and in hamlets under each mother village.

These textile mills arose because of the extremely rich black soil deposits in and around Kallupatti, which favours cotton cultivation in large volumes.\nTextile industries (weaving mills, spinning mills, dyeing units), handlooms, handicrafts and factories have grown around T.Kallupatti, leading to a large number of jobs for men and women. This is due to the cheap labour around the town. Textile mills from [[Rajapalayam]] have opened their units in the vicinity. The subsequent availability of jobs for women accounts for more than 40% jobs for women, with  the Chennai-based ROPE company providing training and job opportunities for women.\n\nMajor employers include:\n\n* Vee Bee Textile Mills \n* Small-Scale Industrial units in Gandhi Niketan, including leather factories.\n* Khadi Units.\n* M/s.

The initial for Kallupatti comes from the name of the mother village from which it derives its existence. The form is similar to that between a mother and her children, a convention which was a feature of the original Tamil culture for years. T.Kallupatti's mother village is [[Devankuruchi]] (spelled as Thevankurichi), a small village on the road towards [[Peraiyur]]. The Devankurichi hill is a symbol of spirituality, one which is visible while driving near to T.Kallupatti. Many people throng to the Agneeswaran Temple of Devankurichi in order to perform the last rites of those who are dead and so it is equated to Kasi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilhindu.com/2010/02/devankurichi-hill-temple/ |title=\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043f\u0417\u0440\u043e\u2561\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0425\u0440\u043f\u0411\u0440\u043e\u2592\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u042a\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u042a\u0440\u043e\u2510 \u2013 \u0440\u043e\u042a\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u2592\u0440\u043f\u0411\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0440\u043e\u2593\u0440\u043f\u0418\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u2593\u0440\u043f\u041d \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043f\u0416\u0440\u043e\u2591\u0440\u043f\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043f\u0416\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u2561\u0440\u043e\u0429\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0425\u0440\u043e\u2502\u0440\u043f\u041d &#124; \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u2524\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u2563\u0440\u043e\u2510\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0440\u043f\u041d\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043f\u0411 |publisher=Tamilhindu.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Community===\nT.Kallupatti is a symbol of mixed culture. \n\nAll communities contribute equally to the total population of the town and the people of Kallupatti live in harmony, which is not the case in other villages of south Tamil Nadu, where caste-related violence is common.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Brahmin population has been eroded, though they were once dominant in the community.\n\nThe Christian population in the town has increased recently to a significant number.

The history of this practice goes back over five hundred years to when the Karaikeni ruler Arasuthevar decided to resolve a dispute between two other small rulers.

On entering the campus of this institution, which is located in a sprawling 40 acres of land, one can feel the peace and tranquility that pervades the place.\n\n===Formation===\nGandhi Niketan Ashram, which has a long history and rich tradition behind it, is the brain-child of Freedom fighter G. Venkatachalapathy (\"The Architect of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Movement in Tamil Nadu\") and was started in 1940 to help create an independent India and reconstruct the type of rural India envisioned by [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]].\n\n===After independence===\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, the Gandhi Niketan Ashram was involved in areas like community development, panchayati raj, and khadi and village industries.  Development officials and activists from all over India were trained here to work at a grassroots level. The Ashram also played a key role in the Bhoodan movement spearheaded by [[Acharya Vinoba Bhave]].\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], the Nobel laureate and civil rights leader of America, visited the founder of the Madras twice and obtained a first-hand account of the experiences of Venkatachalapathy in organizing Satyagraha and constructive programmes. [[E. F. Schumacher]], one of the founders of the Green Movement in the west and renowned author of the book ''Small is Beautiful'' visited the Ashram in 1962 and obtained valuable insights into the areas of appropriate technology for the benefit of the rural poor. Schumacher was later seen as an adviser for the Indian planning commission in the early 1970s.\n\n===Objectives===\n*To implement the Gandhian vision of Gram Swaraj by promoting constructive training, demonstration and development programmes.\n*To enable the villagers to produce their own clothing by spinning and weaving with hand-spun yarn.\n*To promote an appropriate educational system suited to rural realities based on the Gandhian concept of Basic Education.\n*To eradicate the evil of untouchability and to propagate Adult Literacy.\n*To train rural people to keep their villages clean.\n*To improve agricultural practices and to teach villagers to produce nutritive food grains.\n*To educate people on the dangers of alcoholism and wean them away from liquor.\n*To achieve all of the above in order to create a village reconstruction army.\n\n=== e-Learning at Gandhiniketan Ashram ===\nAn ambitious programme to introduce computer-aided learning and interactive curriculum support in 1,000 rural schools in the country was launched here in 2008. The e-learning/digital content programme was launched by former President [[A P J Abdul Kalam]] at the Gandhi Niketan Ashram School. The initiative helps students clarify their doubts while sitting in their class. Schools are given the infrastructure required for IT-based education which includes animation and interactive tools for various projects at the high/higher secondary school level. \n<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blnus/27021405.htm/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Public administration and rural development==\n{{See also|Madurai District}}\nThe T.Kallupatti Block comprises about 42 Villages and is one of the more effectively administered rural blocks of the state. There is 100% electricity coverage in all villages. Protected Water Supply is available in all villages under the Block. The Male to Female Ratio is 1000-1001, which shows a major shift from [[Usilampatti]] Block (just 20&nbsp;km away) where female infanticide is high. Forty-four per cent of women are employed, which constitutes a diverse workforce. Sixty-five per cent depend on agriculture. MicroFinance and illegal money lending are uncommon in the Block as there are 15 Agriculture Cooperative Banks. All 42 Villages are Panchayats and 39 of the 42 are Revenue Villages. There are 88 Child Welfare Centres with most of them concentrated in the town of T.Kallupatti and these are well connected by village roads. Although Peraiyur is the [[Taluk]], the Central Location of T.Kallupatti and its being on the NH 208 provided it with an advantage in development and so [[Peraiyur]] comes under the T.Kallupatti block as a revenue firka.\n\n===T.Kallupatti Block===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Density of population per km<sup>2</sup> || 319\n|-\n| Percentage of urban population to total Population || 22.69\n|-\n| Number of females per 1000 males || 1001 \n|-\n| Percentage of workers to total population || 51.12\n|-\n| Percentage of female workers to total workers || 44.24 \n|-\n| Percentage of agricultural workers to total workers || 67.46 \n|-\n| Percentage of gross cropped area to net area sown || 99.54 \n|-\n| Bovine population per km<sup>2</sup> || 50.23\n|-\n| Percentage of villages electrified || 100%\n|-\n| Percentage of villages covered by prot. water supply || 100%\n|-\n| No. of police stations || 3\n|-\n| No. of noon meal centres || 88\n|}\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madurai.tn.nic.in/kallupatti.htm |title=Madurai - T Kallupatti Block |publisher=Madurai.tn.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Sustainable development===\nAt T. Kallupatti, 35 street lights, seven sodium vapour lamps at a bus stand, and a motor pumpset of 7.5 horsepower used for an overhead tank are powered by a [[biomass]] gasifier unit. The unit of 12 KVA (kilovolt ampere) generates 220 units a day at a mere Rs.500. The bus stand and a nearby park are lit up round the clock, even in times of load shedding.\n\n====Biomass power generation method====\nThe unit is fuelled completely by Julia Flora, a plant known as Seemakaruvellai (Thorny tree). A feasibility study for the project showed that the plant was available in abundance in the locality. This was critical to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project. Self-help groups supply the wood, which is dried in the sun for 10 days and then chopped into pieces. The progress of the unit is closely monitored. \nThe advantages of biomass power generation method include:\n* Reduction in the emission of carbon and in soil erosion.\n* Provision of a means of restoring degraded land.\n* Reuse of residues from the raw materials of wood, bagasse, rice husk and other agricultural materials. These can be used to generate heat and electricity for agricultural and industrial processes.\n* Short-rotation of wood species, including [[casuarina]], which is used to fuel the biomass units.\n\nBy harvesting crop in rotation, a standing plantation of 250 hectares will grow 10,000 tonnes of casuarina, which is sufficient to generate 1 megawatt. A 2,500-hectare casuarina energy plantation could support a plant of 10-12 MW.\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/23/stories/2008122354720500.htm |title=Archive News |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Police station===\nT.Kallupatti police stations are present in mother villages and in hamlets under each mother village.

This has contributed to the rise of more textile industries in the area. Rice is cultivated in the western side of the town and the block. Due to the presence of black soil there is also a high level of [[Peanut|Groundnut]] cultivation.\n\n===The Institute for Village Industries===\nThe Dr. J.C. Kumarappa Institute of Rural Technology and Development at T. Kallupatti (an institutional training centre of the [[Khadi]] and Village Industries Commission (KVIC)), provided training in a variety of skills. It offer: six-months training in footwear and leather goods manufacturing; five-months training in tailoring and embroidery; four-months training in the servicing of electronics and electrical appliances; three-months training in welding and fabrication, fancy leather and resin-goods making, motor winding, cutting and tailoring; two-months training in exercise book manufacturing, toilet and laundry soap making, handmade paper conversion (notebooks, file, cover, carry bag, etc.) and fruit and vegetable processing; one-month training in spices and masala making, detergent cake making; two-week training in screen printing; week-long training in cleaning powder making, detergent powder, fruit jam, squash and pickle-making, and four-day training in bio manure and vermin-compost. From 2011, this institute was closed by the administration of the Gandhi nekaten ashram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/article40384.ece |title=Training in village industries from Nov 9 |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n===Recent industrialisation===\nT.Kallupatti is at the centre of the Madurai-Rajapalayam belt of textile industries. These textile mills arose because of the extremely rich black soil deposits in and around Kallupatti, which favours cotton cultivation in large volumes.\nTextile industries (weaving mills, spinning mills, dyeing units), handlooms, handicrafts and factories have grown around T.Kallupatti, leading to a large number of jobs for men and women. This is due to the cheap labour around the town. Textile mills from [[Rajapalayam]] have opened their units in the vicinity. The subsequent availability of jobs for women accounts for more than 40% jobs for women, with  the Chennai-based ROPE company providing training and job opportunities for women.\n\nMajor employers include:\n\n* Vee Bee Textile Mills \n* Small-Scale Industrial units in Gandhi Niketan, including leather factories.\n* Khadi Units.\n* M/s.

Murray developed a theory of [[personality psychology|personality]] called personology, based on \"[[need]]\" and \"press\".  Murray was also a co-developer, with [[Christiana Morgan]], of the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT), which he referred to as \"the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music.\"\n\n==Early life & education==\n\nMurray was born in New York City into a wealthy family of Henry Alexander Murray, Sr., and Fannie Morris Babcock,  daughter of financier Samuel Denison Babcock.<ref name=\"ANB\">{{Cite ANB|title=Murray, Henry Alexander, Jr. |id=1400869 |first=Eugene |last=Taylor}}</ref> Murray had an older sister and a younger brother. Carver and Scheier note that \"he got on well with his father but had a poor relationship with his mother\", resulting in a deep-seated feeling of [[depression (mood)|depression]]. They hypothesize that the disruption of this relationship led Murray to be especially aware of people's needs and their importance as underlying determinants of behavior.<ref name=carve>Carver and Scheier (1992) ''Perspectives on Personality'' (2nd edition), Allyn & Bacon.</ref>{{rp|100}}\n\nAt Harvard, he majored in [[history]] with a poor performance, but compensated with [[American football|football]], [[Sport rowing|rowing]] and [[boxing]]. At [[Columbia University]] he did much better in [[medicine]], completed his M.D. and also received an M.A. in [[biology]], in 1919. For the next two years he was an instructor in physiology at Harvard. \nHe received his doctorate in [[biochemistry]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1928, aged 35.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 1916, Murray married, aged 23, and after seven years of marriage, in 1923, he met and fell in love with [[Christiana Morgan]]. He experienced a serious conflict as he did not want to leave his wife, Josephine. This was a turning point in Murray's life as it raised his awareness of conflicting needs, the pressure that can result, and the links to motivation. Carver and Scheier note that it was Morgan who was \"fascinated by the psychology of Carl Jung\" and it was as a result of her urging that he met [[Carl Jung]] in Switzerland.<ref name=carve/> He described Jung as \"The first full blooded, spherical\u2014and Goethean, I would say, intelligence I had ever met.\" He was analyzed by him and studied his works. \"The experience of bringing a problem to a psychologist and receiving an answer that seemed to work had a great impact on Murray, leading him to seriously consider psychology as a career\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = J.

He developed the concepts of latent needs (not openly displayed), manifest needs (observed in people's actions), \"press\" (external influences on motivation) and \"thema\"\u2014\"a pattern of press and need that coalesces around particular interactions\". {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMurray collaborated with [[Stanley Cobb]], Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna.  He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society]] after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n \nIn 1935, Murray and Morgan developed the concept of apperception and the assumption that everyone's thinking is shaped by subjective processes, the rationale behind the [[Thematic apperception test]].

The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of [[offender profiling]] and political psychology. In addition to predicting that Hitler would choose suicide if defeat for Germany was near, Murray's collaborative report stated that Hitler was impotent as far as [[heterosexual]] relations were concerned and that there was a possibility that Hitler had participated in a [[homosexual]] relationship. The report stated: \"The belief that Hitler is homosexual has probably developed (a) from the fact that he does show so many [[Femininity|feminine]] characteristics, and (b) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Party]] during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions.

Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called \"personology\". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies.\n\nMurray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone.\n\nMurray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists,<ref>{{cite book|title=Obeying the Voice of God: Jack MacDonald's Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BAERfC1k2EC&pg=PA11|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Brian Van Brunt|isbn=978-0-9778545-1-6|pages=11\u2013}}</ref> and extended by others, such as D.

Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called \"personology\". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies.\n\nMurray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone.\n\nMurray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists,<ref>{{cite book|title=Obeying the Voice of God: Jack MacDonald's Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BAERfC1k2EC&pg=PA11|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Brian Van Brunt|isbn=978-0-9778545-1-6|pages=11\u2013}}</ref> and extended by others, such as D.

McClelland, Boyatzis and Spencer went on to found the McBer Consultancy. However, Murray's contribution is rarely acknowledged in contemporary academic literature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n''Explorations in Personality''  underlying principles were later adopted by AT&T in the development of [[the Assessment Centre]] methodology, now widely used to assess management potential in both private and public sector organisations.\n\n==Works==\n===Books===\n* Murray, H.

The game was released in five episodes periodically throughout 2015. The game's plot focuses on Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old photography student who discovers that she has the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the [[butterfly effect]]. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. [[Quest (video gaming)#Gather quests|Fetch quests]] and making environmental changes represent the forms of [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]] in addition to using [[Dialog tree|branching choices]] for conversation.\n\nDevelopment of ''Life Is Strange'' began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the [[Pacific Northwest]], and subverted known [[archetype]]s to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and [[character arc]] serve as the central point in the game. During its release, ''Life Is Strange'' received generally favourable reviews commending the character development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of [[taboo]] subjects. Common criticisms included the [[slang]] that was used, poor [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] in earlier episodes, and [[Tone (literature)|tonal]] inconsistencies in the story. It received over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings. It has sold over three million copies as of May 2017. A prequel, ''[[Life Is Strange: Before the Storm]]'', was released in August 2017, and a sequel, ''[[Life Is Strange 2]]'', in September 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Life Is Strange Gameplay.png|thumb|left|250px|Players are able to rewind an event within a certain interval of time.|alt=The player character uses the time travel game mechanic.

Strange'' is set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, [[Oregon]], and is told from the perspective of Maxine \"Max\" Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth-grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson ([[Derek Phillips (actor)|Derek Phillips]]), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling [[tornado]]. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) kill a girl in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] and rescues the girl, revealed to be her childhood friend [[Chloe Price]] ([[Ashly Burch]]). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=30 January 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chrysalis}}</ref> The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a [[viral video]] depicting her kissing several students at a party.<ref name=\"chrysal15\">{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=24 March 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Out of Time}}</ref>\n\nWhen Max meets Chloe at the diner where her mother Joyce ([[Cissy Jones]]) works, they decide to experiment with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber.<ref name=\"chrysal15\" /> Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the [[motorhome]] of Frank Bowers ([[Daniel Bonjour]]), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William ([[Joe Ochman]]) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an [[Multiverse|alternative reality]] where William is alive but Chloe has been [[Paralysis|paralysed from the neck down]] as a result of a collision in her own car.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=19 May 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chaos Theory}}</ref>\n\nMax uses the photo to undo her decision and return to the present day, restoring Chloe's health. Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker containing pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel's grave, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. All of a sudden, the two are ambushed by Jefferson, who [[Anesthesia|anaesthetises]] Max and kills Chloe with a shot to the head. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the \"[[Darkroom|Dark Room]]\", a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Jefferson also reveals that he took Nathan on as a personal student, but killed him before abducting Max due to him giving Rachel an overdose when he tried to mimic Jefferson's work, and intends to do the same to Max after he has the photos he wants.  Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts David, getting Jefferson (and Nathan) arrested.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=28 July 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Dark Room}}</ref>\n\nMax is given the opportunity to go to [[San Francisco]] and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realising that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a [[dream]]scape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by saving Chloe from being shot by Nathan earlier in the week. The only way to prevent it is for Max to go back to that moment via a photo she took and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay to spare Chloe.<ref name=\"Life Is Strange\">{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=20 October 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Polarized}}</ref>\n<!-- Do not add the aftermath of the choices here.

Enix]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The game was released in five episodes periodically throughout 2015. The game's plot focuses on Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old photography student who discovers that she has the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the [[butterfly effect]]. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. [[Quest (video gaming)#Gather quests|Fetch quests]] and making environmental changes represent the forms of [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]] in addition to using [[Dialog tree|branching choices]] for conversation.\n\nDevelopment of ''Life Is Strange'' began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the [[Pacific Northwest]], and subverted known [[archetype]]s to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and [[character arc]] serve as the central point in the game. During its release, ''Life Is Strange'' received generally favourable reviews commending the character development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of [[taboo]] subjects. Common criticisms included the [[slang]] that was used, poor [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] in earlier episodes, and [[Tone (literature)|tonal]] inconsistencies in the story. It received over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings. It has sold over three million copies as of May 2017. A prequel, ''[[Life Is Strange: Before the Storm]]'', was released in August 2017, and a sequel, ''[[Life Is Strange 2]]'', in September 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Life Is Strange Gameplay.png|thumb|left|250px|Players are able to rewind an event within a certain interval of time.|alt=The player character uses the time travel game mechanic.

Strange'' is set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, [[Oregon]], and is told from the perspective of Maxine \"Max\" Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth-grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson ([[Derek Phillips (actor)|Derek Phillips]]), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling [[tornado]]. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) kill a girl in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] and rescues the girl, revealed to be her childhood friend [[Chloe Price]] ([[Ashly Burch]]). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=30 January 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chrysalis}}</ref> The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a [[viral video]] depicting her kissing several students at a party.<ref name=\"chrysal15\">{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=24 March 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Out of Time}}</ref>\n\nWhen Max meets Chloe at the diner where her mother Joyce ([[Cissy Jones]]) works, they decide to experiment with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber.<ref name=\"chrysal15\" /> Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the [[motorhome]] of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William ([[Joe Ochman]]) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an [[Multiverse|alternative reality]] where William is alive but Chloe has been [[Paralysis|paralysed from the neck down]] as a result of a collision in her own car.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=19 May 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chaos Theory}}</ref>\n\nMax uses the photo to undo her decision and return to the present day, restoring Chloe's health. Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker containing pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel's grave, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. All of a sudden, the two are ambushed by Jefferson, who [[Anesthesia|anaesthetises]] Max and kills Chloe with a shot to the head. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the \"[[Darkroom|Dark Room]]\", a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Jefferson also reveals that he took Nathan on as a personal student, but killed him before abducting Max due to him giving Rachel an overdose when he tried to mimic Jefferson's work, and intends to do the same to Max after he has the photos he wants.  Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts David, getting Jefferson (and Nathan) arrested.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=28 July 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Dark Room}}</ref>\n\nMax is given the opportunity to go to [[San Francisco]] and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realising that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a [[dream]]scape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by saving Chloe from being shot by Nathan earlier in the week. The only way to prevent it is for Max to go back to that moment via a photo she took and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay to spare Chloe.<ref name=\"Life Is Strange\">{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=20 October 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Polarized}}</ref>\n<!-- Do not add the aftermath of the choices here.
