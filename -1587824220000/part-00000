The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of [[John Coleman (musician)|John Coleman]] as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. The theme music was \"[[Te deum]]\" the Eurovision theme.\n\n12 songs were chosen by the Music Publisher's Association.\n\n== A Song for Europe ==\nSong number one was by Scramble, a four piece guitar band from Liverpool, formed in 1969. It was written by Peter Morris (who had written \"[[Mary Ann (Black Lace song)|Mary Ann]]\" last year) and was called \"Don't Throw Your Love Away\". Scramble had already taken part in the 1977 UK final as the group [[Beano (band)|Beano]] and consisted of [[Freddie Philips]], Ken Smith, [[Richard Talent]] and [[John Birch (bassist)|John Birch]].\n\nSong number two was by [[Maggie Moone]], a solo singer from Birmingham, singing \"Happy Everything\". It was written by [[Geoff Stephens]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]].\n\nSong number three was by Plain Sailing, a five-piece group singing \"Easy\". It was written by Stewart Freeman, a pseudonym of the names of the Stewart brothers (Alan, Colin and Paul Stewart) and Robert Freeman. Other band members are Alan Coulter and Dave Winter.\n\nSong number four was by a Welsh solo singer called Sonja Jones, singing \"Here We'll Stay.\" It was written by [[Tony Coulton]] who had been at Song for Europe 1979. Like many of the songs, backing singers could be heard, but not seen on stage. It received top marks from one of the Welsh juries during the voting. This song was later recorded by [[Annifrid Lyngstad|Frida]] (of [[ABBA]]) and included on her solo album ''[[Something's Going On]]''.\n\nSong number five was by the eventual winners [[Prima Donna (UK band)|Prima Donna]], singing \"Love Enough for Two\". It was written by Stuart Slater and [[Stephanie de Sykes]]. The band were especially put together for the contest. At the Eurovision, very little was changed in the performance, except for the colour of their outfits. At the Song for Europe contest, the lead singer, Danny Finn can be clearly seen whispering something to his female partner, [[Sally-Ann Triplett]] on two occasions, although it's unknown what was said.\n\nSong number six was by 16-year-old Jacqui Scott, from Blackpool, singing \"Symphony for You\". She performed solo at a piano, although she did stand up later to sing in front of the piano, suggesting that someone else was playing a piano throughout.\n\nSong number seven was written by [[Paul Curtis (musician)|Paul Curtis]] and performed by Duke and the Aces, a five piece group featuring Canadians and an Italian, [[Bruno Tonioli]], also the act's choreographer, who went on to be a judge on ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. Also a member of the group was [[Nicola Martin]], who put together the group [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] (which featured [[Cheryl Baker]], who was also in this contest) the following year. The other \"Aces\" were [[Roland Wollens]], Tim Clark and [[Pippa Urry]]. The song was called \"Love is Alive\".\n\nSong number eight, \"Everything's Alright\", was written and sung by Roy Winston from Oxford. The performance featured five backing singers who were all visible on stage.\n\nSong number nine, \"Love Comes, Love Grows\", was performed by a duo called Midnite, aka [[Eddie Howell]] and [[Lynne Hillier]].\n\nSong number ten was by the Main Event, a band made up of members from [[Co-Co (band)|Co-Co]], who had entered A Song for Europe in 1976 and 1978, winning on that second occasion. It featured Cheryl Baker, who found success with Bucks Fizz a year later. The song was called \"Gonna Do My Best\".\n\nSong number eleven was by [[Pussyfoot]], a \"punk\" type band singing \"I Want to Be Me\" written by Mick Flynn, who was in the band with four women. This song was notable for the fact that it polarized most juries &ndash; they either loved it or hated it. The Belfast jury gave it the top mark, and it was the only song to get a perfect score from each of the Irish jury members. Loud cheers were heard from the audience every time votes were given to the band, even if they were low scores.\n\nSong number twelve was by 19-year-old Kim Clark, who had entered the previous year with a similar song. It was called \"Surrender\" and finished third, two points behind the tied winners. This song was never intended as an entry; former Eurovision entrants [[The New Seekers]] were due to enter with their song \"Tell me\", but it was disqualified when the group released it as a single and performed it on ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' before the contest. Coincidentally, rival performers Donna Jones and Mick Flynn (of Pussyfoot) and Danny Finn (of Prima Donna) were at various times members of The New Seekers, Finn having only just left his former group prior to fronting Prima Donna.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each of the 11 jurors awarded 1-5 points to each song, the total scores being added up, with the song earning the most points being awarded 12 points, the second placed song earned 11, the third 10 and so on, down to 1 point for the song with the fewest votes.\n\nThe jury spokesperson could be seen on screen awarding the votes, sometimes with the jury members in vision.  These were broadcast from the BBC's 14 regional news studios.\n\nOwing to a tie break and with the live show quickly running out of time, a clearly flustered Terry Wogan, unsure of what to do in this unprecedented circumstance, returned to the 14 juries who were hastily asked to pick their favorite between songs two and five. Some juries ignored their previous voting and switched allegiance to Prima Donna who won by eight votes to six.<ref>[http://www.songs4europe.com/25.html A Song for Europe 1980]</ref>\n\n==Jury Spokespeople==\nIn vote order:\n\n*Aberdeen: Gerry Davies,\n*Newcastle: [[Mike Neville (newsreader)|Mike Neville]],\n*Plymouth: Donald Heighway,\n*Leeds: [[Brian Baines]],\n*Southampton: Peter McCann,\n*Bangor: Alyn Evans,\n*London: [[Colin Berry]],\n*Cardiff: Ewan Thomas,\n*Birmingham: David Stevens,\n*Glasgow: Douglas Brock,\n*Belfast: Michael Baguley,\n*Bristol: Derek Jones,\n*Norwich: Jill Hewitt,\n*Manchester: [[John Mundy (presenter)|John Mundy]]\n\n== At Eurovision ==\n\nAt the Eurovision itself, \"Love Enough for Two\" scored 106 points and was positioned third overall.

The qibla is the direction of the building of [[Ka'bah]] in the [[Great Mosque|Sacred Mosque]], [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe to be a sacred site built by the prophets [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. According to the Islamic belief, this direction was ordained by God in the Quran, in chapter [[Al-Baqarah]] verses 144, 149, and 150, revealed to Muhammad in the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]]; prior to this revelation Muhammad and his followers in [[Medina]] faced [[Jerusalem]] for prayers. Other than for the ritual prayer, it is also the direction for entering the state of [[ihram]] for the [[hajj]] pilgrimage, where animals are turned to in an [[dhabihah|Islamic slaughter]], for the dead when buried, the recommended direction to make [[dua|supplications]], and the avoided direction when relieving nature and spitting. Most mosque contains a ''[[mihrab]]'' or a wall niche indicating the direction of the qibla. In practice, there are two manners of observing the qibla: ''ayn al-ka'bah'' which faces the Ka'ba exactly, and ''jihat al-ka'bah'' which faces only its general direction. Most Islamic authorities believe that the more precise ''ayn al-ka'bah'' is only required when possible (for example, inside the Sacred Mosque or in its surroundings), and otherwise ''jihat al-ka'bah'' can be used.\n\nThe most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers is the direction shown by the [[great circle]]\u2014in the [[Spherical Earth|Earth's sphere]]\u2014passing through the Ka'bah and one's location. This direction shows the shortest possible path from one's place to Ka'bah, and allows for the exact calculation (''hisab'') of the qibla using a [[spherical trigonometry|spherical trigonometric]] formula taking the coordinates of one's place and the Ka'bah as inputs.  The method is applied to develop [[Mobile app|mobile applications]] and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the [[qibla compass]]. In addition, the qibla can also be determined by observing the shadow of a vertical rod at or around two times of the year when the sun is directly overhead in Mecca\u2014on 28 May at 12:18 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] or 9:18 UTC and on 16 July at 12:27 SAST/9:27 UTC).\n\nBefore the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla; these includes following the customs of the [[companions of the Prophet]] in one's place, using the setting and rising points of celestial objects, the direction of the wind, or using due south\u2014Muhammad's qibla in Medina\u2014everywhere. Early Islamic astronomy were built on its Indian and Greek counterparts\u2014especially the works of [[Ptolemy]], and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate approximate directions of the qibla, starting from mid-9th century. In the late 9th century and in the 10th century, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla that are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this \"qibla of the astronomers\" were used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in a diversity of qiblas in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result were only available in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] on October 2007 generated a discussion with regards to qibla from the outer space. On Sheikh Muszaphar's request, the Islamic authority of his home country Malaysia issued a detailed guidance, suggesting a determination \"based on what is possible\" for the astronaut, in line with recommendations from other Islamic scholars.\n\n==Location==\n{{main|Ka'bah|al-Masjid al-Haram}}\n{{Location map+|Middle East2| relief = yes |float=right|caption=Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem|places=\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=21.4228714|long=39.823546 |label=[[Mecca]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=24.4672105|long=39.6089423|label=[[Medina]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=31.7760692|long=35.2335915|label=[[Jerusalem]]}}\n}}\nThe qibla is the direction of the [[Ka'bah]], a cube-like building at the centre of the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] (''al-Masjid al-Haram'') in Mecca, in the [[Hejaz]] region of Saudi Arabia. Other than its role as qibla, it is a [[Holiest sites in Islam|sacred site]] for Muslims, known as the House of God (''Bait Allah'') and where the [[tawaf]] is performed during the [[hajj]] and [[umra]] pilgrimages. The Ka'bah has an approximately rectangular ground plan with its four corners pointing close to the four [[cardinal direction]]s.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=317}} According to the [[Quran]], it was built by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]]\u2014both are prophets in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}} Not much historical records remain about the history of the Ka'bah prior to the rise of Islam, but in the generations before [[Muhammad]], the building had been used as a shrine of the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic religion]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}}\n\nThe religious status of Ka'bah (or the Sacred Mosque in which it is located) as the qibla is based on the verses 144, 149, and 150 of the Quran's chapter of [[Surat al-Baqara|al-Baqarah]], each of which contains a command to \"turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque\" (''fawalli wajhaka shatr al-Masjid il-Haram'').{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=97\u201398}} According to the Islamic tradition, these verses were revealed on the month of [[Rajab]] or [[Shaban]] on the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]] (624 [[Common Era|CE]]), or about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad's [[Hegira|migration to Medina]].{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=104}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Prior to these revelations, Muhammad and the Muslims in Medina had prayed toward [[Jerusalem]] as qibla, the same direction [[Mizrah|used]] by the Jews of Medina for their prayers. Islamic traditions say that these verses were revealed during a prayer congregation; Muhammad and his followers immediately turned their directions from Jerusalem to Mecca in the middle of the prayer ritual. The location of this event now becomes [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] (\"the Mosque of the Two Qiblas\").{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nThere are different reports about the qibla direction when Muhammad was in Mecca (before his migration to Medina). According to one report, cited by historian [[al-Tabari]] and exegete [[al-Baydawi]], Muhammad prayed towards the Ka'bah. Another report, cited by [[al-Baladhuri]] and also by al-Tabari, says that Muhammad prayed towards Jerusalem while in Mecca. Another report, mentioned by [[Ibn Hisham]]'s [[Prophetic biography|biography of Muhammad]], says that Muhammad prayed in such a way as to simultaneously face the Ka'bah and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Today Muslims of all branches, including the Sunni and the Shia, all toward the Ka'bah. Historically, one major exception was the [[Qarmatians]], a now-defunct syncretic Shia sect which rejected the Ka'bah as the qibla; in 930, they sacked Mecca, took Ka'bah's [[Black Stone]] to their centre of power in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]], with the intention of starting a new era in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=321}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|p=149}}{{efn|This act was condemned both by the Sunni [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] and the Shia [[Fatimid caliphate|Fatimid one]].

In Islamic ritual and law, it refers to a special direction faced by Muslims during prayers and other religious contexts.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} [[Ulama|Islamic religious scholars]] agree that facing the qibla is a necessary condition for the validity of [[salah]]\u2014the Islamic ritual prayer\u2014in normal conditions;{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=103}} exceptions include prayers during the state of fear or of war, as well as non-obligatory prayers during travel.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=91}}  In addition, the [[hadith]] also prescribed Muslims to face the qibla when entering the state of [[ihram]] for hajj, as after the middle ''[[Stoning of the Devil|jamrah]]'' (stone-throwing ritual) during the pilgrimage.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}  The [[Adab (Islam)|Islamic etiquette]] (''adab'') calls for Muslim to turn the head of the animal when [[Dhabihah|slaughtered]], and the faces of the dead when buried, toward the qibla.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} The qibla is the preferred direction when making a [[dua|supplication]] and is to be avoided when [[defecation|defecating]], [[urination|urinating]], and [[spitting]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nInside a [[mosque]], the qibla is usually indicated by a ''[[mihrab]]'', a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] in its qibla-facing wall. In a congregational prayer, the [[imam]] (worship leader) stands in it or close to it, in front of the rest of the congregation.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}} The ''mihrab'' started became part of a mosque during the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad period]] and its form is standardised during the [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid period]]; before that, the qibla of a mosque is known from the orientation of one of its walls, called the qibla wall. The term ''mihrab'' itself is only attested once in the Quran, but it refers to a place of prayer of the [[Israelites]] rather than a part of a mosque.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}}{{efn|This reference occurs in {{Cite Quran|19|11|style=nosup}}}}  The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt, one of the oldest mosques, is known to have been originally built without a ''mihrab'', even though now one has been added.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=4}}\n\n===''Ayn al-ka'bah'' and ''jihat al-ka'bah''===\n''Ayn al-ka'bah'' is facing the qibla so that an imaginary line extending from the person's line of sight would pass through the Ka'bah. This manner of observing the qibla is easily done inside the Great Mosque of Mecca and its surroundings, but given that the Ka'bah is less than {{conv|20|m|ft}} wide, this is virtually impossible from further locations.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=104\u2013105}} For example, from Medina\u2014with a {{conv|338|km|mi}} straight-line distance from the Ka'bah\u2014a 1\u00b0 deviation from the precise imaginary line\u2014an error hardly noticeable when setting one's prayer mat or assuming one's posture\u2014results in some {{convert|5.9|km|mi}} shift from the site of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=137}} This effect is amplified when further than Mecca:{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=134}} from [[Jakarta]], Indonesia\u2014some {{conv|7900|km|mi}} away, a 1\u00b0 deviation causes more than {{conv|100|km|mi}} shift, and even an [[arc second]]'s deviation\u2014{{nowrap|({{frac|1|3600}} of a degree)}}\u2014 causes more than {{conv|100|m|ft}} of shift from the location of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} In comparison, the construction process of a mosque can easily introduce up to 5\u00b0 error from the calculated qibla, and the installation of prayer rugs inside the mosque as indicators for worshippers can add up to a further 5\u00b0 deviation from the mosque's orientation.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\nA minority of Islamic religious scholars\u2014for example [[Ibn Arabi]]\u2014considers ''ayn al-ka'bah'' to be obligatory during the ritual prayer, while others consider it only obligatory when one is able. For locations further than Mecca, scholars such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Al-Qurtubi]] argue that it is permissible to assume ''jihat al-ka'bah'', facing only the general direction of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=92, 95}}  Some further argues that the ritual condition of facing the qibla is already fulfilled simply when the imaginary line to the Ka'bah is within one's field of vision.{{sfn|King|1996|p=134}} Therefore, for instance, there are legal opinions that accept the entire southeastern quadrant in [[Al-Andalus]] (historical Spain and Portugal), and the southwestern quadrant in [[Central Asia]], to be valid qibla.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}} Arguments for the validity of ''jihat al-Ka'bah'' include the wording of the Quran which only commands Muslims to \"turn [one's] face\" toward the Great Mosque, and to avoid the impossible requirement which would result if ''ayn al-Ka'bah'' were to be obligatory in all places.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=95}} The [[Shafi'i school]] of Islamic law, as codified in [[Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi]]'s ''Kitab al-Tanbih fi'l-Fiqh'', argues that one must follow the qibla indicated by the local mosque when one is not near Mecca or, when not near a mosque, ask a trustworthy person. When this is not possible, one is to [[ijtihad|make one's own determination]] by means available in one's disposal.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}}{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=94}}\n\n==Determination==\n=== Theoretical basis: the great circle ===\n[[File:Great circle passing through two points.svg|thumb|The great circle passing through two points on a sphere indicates the shortest path between those two. In this picture, the red circle indicates the great circle connecting A and B, and the shortest path between them is indicated in bold.]]\nThe [[great circle]] is the theoretical basis in most models that seek to scientifically determine the direction of qibla from a locality\u2014in such models, the qibla is defined as direction of the great circle passing through the locality and the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|King|2004|p=166}} A great circle, also called the orthodrome, is any circle on a sphere whose centre is identical to the centre of the sphere. For example, all lines of [[longitude]] are great circles of the Earth, while the [[equator]] is the only line of [[latitude]] that is also a great circle (other lines of latitude are centered north or south of the centre of the Earth).{{sfn|Abo-Zahhad|Ahmed|Mourad|2013|p=172}} One of the properties of a great circle is that it indicates the shortest path connecting any pair of points along the circle\u2014this is the basis of its use to determine the qibla. The great circle is similarly used to find the shortest flight path connecting two locations\u2014therefore the qibla calculated using the great circle method is generally close to the direction of a direct flight from the locality to Mecca.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} As the [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] is a more accurate [[figure of the Earth]] than a perfect sphere, modern researchers have looked into using ellipsoidal models to calculate the qibla, replacing the great circle by the [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]]. This results in greatly more complicated calculations, while the improvement in accuracy falls well within the typical precision of the setting out of a mosque or the placement of a mat.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|pp=132\u2013134}} For example, calculations using the [[Geodetic Reference System 1980|GRS 80]] ellipsoidal model yields the qibla of 18\u00b047\u203206\u2033 for a location in [[San Francisco]] while the great circle method yields 18\u00b051\u203205\u2033.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=35}}\n\n=== Calculations with spherical trigonometry ===\nThe great circle model is applied to calculate the qibla using [[spherical trigonometry]]\u2014a branch of [[geometry]] that deals with the mathematical relations between the sides and angles of triangles formed by three great circles of a sphere (as opposed to the conventional [[trigonometry]] which deals with those of a two-dimensional triangle). In the following figure, a location <math>O</math>, the Ka'bah <math>Q</math>, and the north pole <math>N</math> form a triangle on the sphere of the earth.

They were developed by various Muslim scholars, including [[Habash al-Hasib]] (active in Damascus and Baghdad ca. 850 CE), [[Al-Nayrizi]] (Baghdad, ca. 900 CE), {{sfn|King|1986|pp=85\u201386}} [[Ibn Yunus]] (10th/11th century CE),{{sfn|King|1986|p=85}} [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (11th century CE),{{sfn|King|1986|p=85}} and [[Al-Biruni]] (11th century CE).{{sfn|King|1986|p=86}} Today spherical trigonometry also underly nearly all application or websites which calculate the qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}\n\nWhen the qibla angle with respect to the north, <math>\\angle q</math>, is known, the [[true north]] needs to be known in order to find the qibla in practice.

At this point, any vertical rod would cast a shadow oriented in the north\u2013south direction. The result of this observation is very accurate but it requires an accurate determination of the local time of culmination as well as making the observation at that exact moment.{{sfn|Ilyas|1984|pp=171\u2013172}} Another common method is using the compass, which is more practical because it can be done at any time; the disadvantage is that the north indicated by a magnetic compass differs from the true north.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}{{sfn|Ilyas|1984|p=172}} This [[magnetic declination]] can measure up to 20\u00b0, varies in different places on Earth and [[polar wandering|changes over time]].{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\n=== Shadow observation ===\n[[File:Direction of qibla using shadow.svg|thumb|left|Twice a year, the sun passes directly above the Ka'ba, allowing the observation of its direction from the shadow of a vertical rod.]]\nAs observed from Earth, the sun appears to \"[[Sun path|shift]]\" between the [[Tropic of Cancer|Northern]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Southern]] Tropics seasonally; additionally, it [[Diurnal motion|appears to move]] from east to west daily as a consequence of the earth's rotation. The combination of these two apparent motions means that every day the sun crosses the meridian once, usually not precisely overhead but to the north or to the south of the observer.

A straight line shown by the world map in using the [[Mercator projection]] is called the [[rhumb line]] or the loxodrome, which is used to indicate the qibla by a minority of Muslims.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|pp=31\u201332}}{{efn|For an example of the loxodrome used to find qibla, see [[#North America]].}} It can result in a dramatic differences in some places, for example in some of North America the flat map shows Mecca in the southeast while the great circle calculation shows northeast,{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} and in Japan the map shows southwest while the great circle shows northwest.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=110}} The majority of Muslims, however, follow the great circle method.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}\n\n=== Traditional methods ===\n\nHistorical records and surviving old mosques show that throughout history the qibla was often determined by simple methods based on tradition or \"folk science\" not based on mathematical astronomy. Some early Muslims uses due south everywhere as qibla, following Muhammad's instruction to face south while he was in Medina (Mecca is due south of Medina) in a literal manner. Some mosques in as far as al-Andalus to the west and Central Asia to the east faces south even though Mecca is nowhere near that direction.{{sfn|King|1996|p=130}} In various places, there is also the \"qiblas of the companion\" (''qiblat al-sahaba''), those which were used in those places by the [[Companions of the Prophet]]\u2014the first generation of Muslims, who are considered role models in Islam. Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side by side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Directions described as the qiblas of the companions include due south in Syria and Palestine,{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}} the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132, also figure 4.2 in p. 131}}\n\n== Development of methods ==\n=== Pre-astronomy ===\nThe determination of qibla is an important problems for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla in order to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques.{{sfn|King|1996|p=128}} When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the [[Hejaz]] region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims have reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new places.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013132}} Mathematical methods based on astronomy would only develop at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth and even then they were not initially popular. Therefore, early Muslims relied on non-astronomical methods.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThere is a wide range of traditional methods in determining the qibla in the early Islamic period, resulting in different directions even from the same place. In addition to due south (used because it was the direction to which Muhammad prayed from Medina) and directions known as the qiblas of the companions (varies by place), the Arabs also knew a form of \"folk\" astronomy\u2014called so by [[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]] to distinguish it from conventional astronomy which is an exact science\u2014originating from pre-Islamic traditions.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} It used natural phenomenon, including the observation of the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and wind, without any basis in mathematics. These methods yields specific directions in individual localities, often using the fixed setting and rising points of a specific star, the sunrise or sunset at the [[equinoxes]] or at the [[summer solstice|summer]] or the [[winter solstice]]s.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such qibla directions recorded in historical sources include: sunrise at the equinoxes (due west) in [[the Maghreb]], sunset at the equinoxes (due east) in India, the origin of the [[north wind]] or the fixed location of the [[North Star]] in Yemen, the rising point of the star ''Suhayl'' ([[Canopus]]) in Syria, and the midwinter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such directions appear in texts of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) and texts of folk astronomy. Astronomers (aside from folk astronomers) typically do not comment on these methods, but they were not opposed by Islamic legal scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132\u2013133}} The traditional directions were still in use when mathematical methods later developed and found different directions to Mecca, and they still appear in some surviving medieval mosques today.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\n=== With astronomy ===\n[[File:Al-Khalili qibla table, Damascus copy 15th-16th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A portion of the qibla table compiled by the astronomer and ''[[muwaqqit]]'' [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] of [[Damascus]] in the fourteenth-century CE. The qibla directions are listed in the Arabic [[sexagesimal]] notation.]]\nThe study of astronomy\u2014known as ''ilm al-falaq'' in the Islamic intellectual tradition\u2014began to appear in the Islamic World in the second half of the eighth century, centered in [[Baghdad]], the principal city of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Initially, the science was introduced through the works if Indian authors, but since the ninth century the works of Greek astronomers such as [[Ptolemy]] were translated to Arabic and became the main reference in the field.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=20\u201321}} Muslim astronomers preferred Greek astronomy because they consider it to be better supported by theoretical explanations and therefore can be developed as an exact science; however, the influence of Indian astronomy survives especially on the compilation of astronomical tables.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=21}} This new science is applied to develop new methods of determining the qibla, making use of the concept of [[Latitude|latitudes]] and [[Longitude|longitudes]] introduced in Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' as well as trigonometric formulae developed by Muslim scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=141}} Most textbooks of astronomy written in the medieval Islamic World contain a chapter on the determination of qibla, considered one of the many things connecting astronomy with the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (''sharia'').{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}{{sfn|Morelon|1996a|p=15}} According to David A. King, various medieval solutions for the determination of qibla \"bear witness to the development of mathematical methods from the 3rd/9th to the 8th/14th centuries and to the level of sophistication in trigonometry and computational techniques attained by these scholars.\"{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}\n\nThe first mathematical methods developed in the early ninth century were approximate solutions to the mathematical problem, usually using a flat map or two-dimensional geometry. Because in reality the earth is spherical, the directions found were not exact, but they were sufficient for locations relatively close to Mecca (including as far as Egypt and Iran) because the errors were only less than 2\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=142-143}}\n\nExact solutions based on three-dimensional geometry and spherical trigometry began to appear in middle of 9th century. [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi|Habash al-Hasib]] (fl. c. 850 M in Baghdad and Damascus) wrote an early example of such solutions, using an \"[[Orthographic projection|analemma]]\", or a two-dimensional procedure to derive formulas in spherical trigonometry. His procedure involves working with a circle and a series of points and lines drawn in a specific manner to find a direction now known to be equivalent to the solution obtained from the modern formula.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}}} Another group of solution uses trigonometric formulas, for example [[Al-Nayrizi]] from Baghdad (fl. c. 900) developed a mathematical procedure using a four-step application of [[Menelaus's theorem]].{{sfn|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}}} Subsequent scholars, including Ibn Yunus, Abu al-Wafa, Ibn al-Haitham and Al-Biruni, proposers other methods which are confirmed to be accurate from the viewpoint of modern astronomy, using either analemmas or direct application of formulas.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}\n\nMuslim astronomers subsequently used these methods to compile tables showing qibla from a list of locations, grouped by their latitude and longitude differences from Mecca. The oldest known example was written in Baghdad ca. 9th century CE containing entries for each degrees and [[arc minute]]s up to 20\u00b0.{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} In the fourteenth century, [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]], an astronomer who serves as a ''[[muwaqqit]]'' (timekeeper) in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus, compiled a table of qibla for 2,880 coordinates with longitude difference of up to 60\u00b0 from Mecca, and with latitudes ranging from 10\u00b0 to 50\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} King opined that among the medieval qibla tables, al-Khalili's work is \"the most impressive from the view of its scope and its accuracy\".{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}}\n\nThe accuracy of applying these methods to actual locations depend on the accuracy of its input parameters\u2014the local latitude and the latitude of Mecca, and the longitude difference. At the time of the development of these methods, the latitude of a location can be determined to several arc minutes' accuracy, but there was no accurate method to determine a location's longitude.{{sfn|King|1996|p=153}} Common approximate methods used to determine the longitude difference include comparing the local timing of [[lunar eclipse]] versus the timing in Mecca, or measuring the distance of caravan routes;{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|1986|p=86}} the Central Asian scholar Al-Biruni made his estimate by averaging various approximate methods.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}} Because the longitude inaccuracy, medieval qibla calculations (including those using mathematically accurate methods) differ from the modern values. For example, while the [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo was built using the \"qibla of the astronomers\", but the mosque's qibla (127\u00b0) somewhat differs from the result of modern calculations (135\u00b0) because the longitude difference used was off by 3\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAccurate longitude values in the Islamic world were only available after the application of [[cartography|cartographic]] [[surveying|surveys]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern coordinates, along with new technologies such as [[GPS satellite]]s and electronic instruments, resulted in the development of practical instruments to calculate the qibla.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}} Qibla found using modern instruments might differ from the direction of mosques, because a mosque might be built before the advent of modern data, and orientation inaccuracies might have been introduced during the building process of modern mosques.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}} When this is known, sometimes the direction of the mosque's ''mihrab'' is still observers, and sometimes a marker is added (such as lines drawn in the mosque) that can be followed instead of the ''mihrab''.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}}\n\n== Instruments ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = QiblaMat.jpg\n | image2 = Turkish and Islamic Museum 0951.jpg\n | footer = A [[prayer mat]] with a modern [[qibla compass]] (''left''); an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-era]] qibla compass dated 1738 (''right'').}}\nMuslims use various instrument to find the qibla when not near a mosque.

The modern qibla for Cairo is 135\u00b0, which was not known at the time.{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} This diversity also result in the non-uniform layout in Cairo's districts, because the streets are often oriented according to the orientation of the mosques. Muslim historical records also indicate the diversity of qibla in other major cities, including [[Cordoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (113\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 150\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 were recorded in the 12th century) and [[Samarkand]] (180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 230\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 270\u00b0 were recorded in the 11th century).{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} According to the doctrine of ''jihat al-ka'bah'', the diverse directions of qibla are still valid as long as they are still in the same broad direction.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:01 05 Street WDC 8jul05.jpg|thumb|The [[Islamic Center of Washington]] (founded 1953), one of the early mosques in the United States, the qibla of which faces northeast in line with astronomical calculations.{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} ]]\nPlaces long settled by Muslim populations tend to have resolved the question of the direction of qibla over time. Other places, like the United States and Canada, have only had large Muslim communities in the past several decades, and the determination of qibla can be a matter of debate.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} The [[Islamic Center of Washington|Islamic Center of Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because [[Washington, D.C.]]'s latitude is 17\u00b030\u2032 more northerly than that of Mecca. Even though line drawn on world maps\u2014such as those using the Mercator projection\u2014would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, astronomical calculations using the great circle method do yield a north-of-east direction (56\u00b033\u2032).{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction in world maps.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} As the Muslim community grew and the number of mosque increased, in 1978 an American Muslim scientist S. Kamal Abdali, wrote an article arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method, which identifies the shortest path to Mecca.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Abdali's conclusion was widely circulated and then  accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a result.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} In 1990, two religious scholars Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla,{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}} and eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=57}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nVariation of the qibla also occurs in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest world Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201425\u00b0 north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=59\u201360}} However, the qibla is often traditionally known as simply 'the west', resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset\u2014which slightly varies throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono ''et al.'' argues that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a \"spiritual prerequisite\" than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Ka'bah itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} On the other hands, Muhammad Hadi Bashori opined that \"correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing,\" and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=60\u201361}} In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla has also occurred in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of [[Muhammadiyah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca he found that mosques in the royal capital of [[Yogyakarta]] had inaccurate qiblas, including the [[Kauman Great Mosque]] which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla was opposed by the traditional ulama of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s and later the Kauman Great Mosque too would be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.{{sfn|Kersten|2017|p=130}}{{sfn|Nashir|2015|p=77}}\n\n=== Outer space ===\n[[File:ISS Aug2005.jpg|thumb|The spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] started discussion about Islamic religious practices in space, including the determination of qibla.]]\nThe issue of qibla from outer space publicly arose before the spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]], a Malaysian surgeon who is a devout Muslim, to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on October 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} The ISS orbits the earth in high speed so that the direction to Mecca changes significantly in matters of seconds.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before his departure, Sheikh Muzsaphar requested guidance from Malaysian religious authorities about the performance of Islamic practices in space, including how to pray, fast, and determine the qibla.

The qibla is the direction of the building of [[Ka'bah]] in the [[Great Mosque|Sacred Mosque]], [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe to be a sacred site built by the prophets [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. According to the Islamic belief, this direction was ordained by God in the Quran, in chapter [[Al-Baqarah]] verses 144, 149, and 150, revealed to Muhammad in the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]]; prior to this revelation Muhammad and his followers in [[Medina]] faced [[Jerusalem]] for prayers. Other than for the ritual prayer, it is also the direction for entering the state of [[ihram]] for the [[hajj]] pilgrimage, where animals are turned to in an [[dhabihah|Islamic slaughter]], for the dead when buried, the recommended direction to make [[dua|supplications]], and the avoided direction when relieving nature and spitting. Most mosque contains a ''[[mihrab]]'' or a wall niche indicating the direction of the qibla. In practice, there are two manners of observing the qibla: ''ayn al-ka'bah'' which faces the Ka'ba exactly, and ''jihat al-ka'bah'' which faces only its general direction. Most Islamic authorities believe that the more precise ''ayn al-ka'bah'' is only required when possible (for example, inside the Sacred Mosque or in its surroundings), and otherwise ''jihat al-ka'bah'' can be used.\n\nThe most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers is the direction shown by the [[great circle]]\u2014in the [[Spherical Earth|Earth's sphere]]\u2014passing through the Ka'bah and one's location. This direction shows the shortest possible path from one's place to Ka'bah, and allows for the exact calculation (''hisab'') of the qibla using a [[spherical trigonometry|spherical trigonometric]] formula taking the coordinates of one's place and the Ka'bah as inputs.  The method is applied to develop [[Mobile app|mobile applications]] and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the [[qibla compass]]. In addition, the qibla can also be determined by observing the shadow of a vertical rod at or around two times of the year when the sun is directly overhead in Mecca\u2014on 28 May at 12:18 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] or 9:18 UTC and on 16 July at 12:27 SAST/9:27 UTC).\n\nBefore the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla; these includes following the customs of the [[companions of the Prophet]] in one's place, using the setting and rising points of celestial objects, the direction of the wind, or using due south\u2014Muhammad's qibla in Medina\u2014everywhere. Early Islamic astronomy were built on its Indian and Greek counterparts\u2014especially the works of [[Ptolemy]], and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate approximate directions of the qibla, starting from mid-9th century. In the late 9th century and in the 10th century, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla that are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this \"qibla of the astronomers\" were used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in a diversity of qiblas in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result were only available in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] on October 2007 generated a discussion with regards to qibla from the outer space. On Sheikh Muszaphar's request, the Islamic authority of his home country Malaysia issued a detailed guidance, suggesting a determination \"based on what is possible\" for the astronaut, in line with recommendations from other Islamic scholars.\n\n==Location==\n{{main|Ka'bah|al-Masjid al-Haram}}\n{{Location map+|Middle East2| relief = yes |float=right|caption=Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem|places=\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=21.4228714|long=39.823546 |label=[[Mecca]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=24.4672105|long=39.6089423|label=[[Medina]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=31.7760692|long=35.2335915|label=[[Jerusalem]]}}\n}}\nThe qibla is the direction of the [[Ka'bah]], a cube-like building at the centre of the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] (''al-Masjid al-Haram'') in Mecca, in the [[Hejaz]] region of Saudi Arabia. Other than its role as qibla, it is a [[Holiest sites in Islam|sacred site]] for Muslims, known as the House of God (''Bait Allah'') and where the [[tawaf]] is performed during the [[hajj]] and [[umra]] pilgrimages. The Ka'bah has an approximately rectangular ground plan with its four corners pointing close to the four [[cardinal direction]]s.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=317}} According to the [[Quran]], it was built by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]]\u2014both are prophets in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}} Not much historical records remain about the history of the Ka'bah prior to the rise of Islam, but in the generations before [[Muhammad]], the building had been used as a shrine of the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic religion]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}}\n\nThe religious status of Ka'bah (or the Sacred Mosque in which it is located) as the qibla is based on the verses 144, 149, and 150 of the Quran's chapter of [[Surat al-Baqara|al-Baqarah]], each of which contains a command to \"turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque\" (''fawalli wajhaka shatr al-Masjid il-Haram'').{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=97\u201398}} According to the Islamic tradition, these verses were revealed on the month of [[Rajab]] or [[Shaban]] on the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]] (624 [[Common Era|CE]]), or about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad's [[Hegira|migration to Medina]].{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=104}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Prior to these revelations, Muhammad and the Muslims in Medina had prayed toward [[Jerusalem]] as qibla, the same direction [[Mizrah|used]] by the Jews of Medina for their prayers. Islamic traditions say that these verses were revealed during a prayer congregation; Muhammad and his followers immediately turned their directions from Jerusalem to Mecca in the middle of the prayer ritual. The location of this event now becomes [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] (\"the Mosque of the Two Qiblas\").{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nThere are different reports about the qibla direction when Muhammad was in Mecca (before his migration to Medina). According to one report, cited by historian [[al-Tabari]] and exegete [[al-Baydawi]], Muhammad prayed towards the Ka'bah. Another report, cited by [[al-Baladhuri]] and also by al-Tabari, says that Muhammad prayed towards Jerusalem while in Mecca. Another report, mentioned by [[Ibn Hisham]]'s [[Prophetic biography|biography of Muhammad]], says that Muhammad prayed in such a way as to simultaneously face the Ka'bah and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Today Muslims of all branches, including the Sunni and the Shia, all toward the Ka'bah. Historically, one major exception was the [[Qarmatians]], a now-defunct syncretic Shia sect which rejected the Ka'bah as the qibla; in 930, they sacked Mecca, took Ka'bah's [[Black Stone]] to their centre of power in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]], with the intention of starting a new era in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=321}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|p=149}}{{efn|This act was condemned both by the Sunni [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] and the Shia [[Fatimid caliphate|Fatimid one]].

Picture from the [[Shah-i-Zinda]], [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan.]]\n{{Fiqh|theological}}\nEtymologically, the Arabic word ''qibla'' ({{lang|ar|\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0629}}) means \"direction\". In Islamic ritual and law, it refers to a special direction faced by Muslims during prayers and other religious contexts.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} [[Ulama|Islamic religious scholars]] agree that facing the qibla is a necessary condition for the validity of [[salah]]\u2014the Islamic ritual prayer\u2014in normal conditions;{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=103}} exceptions include prayers during the state of fear or of war, as well as non-obligatory prayers during travel.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=91}}  In addition, the [[hadith]] also prescribed Muslims to face the qibla when entering the state of [[ihram]] for hajj, as after the middle ''[[Stoning of the Devil|jamrah]]'' (stone-throwing ritual) during the pilgrimage.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}  The [[Adab (Islam)|Islamic etiquette]] (''adab'') calls for Muslim to turn the head of the animal when [[Dhabihah|slaughtered]], and the faces of the dead when buried, toward the qibla.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} The qibla is the preferred direction when making a [[dua|supplication]] and is to be avoided when [[defecation|defecating]], [[urination|urinating]], and [[spitting]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nInside a [[mosque]], the qibla is usually indicated by a ''[[mihrab]]'', a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] in its qibla-facing wall. In a congregational prayer, the [[imam]] (worship leader) stands in it or close to it, in front of the rest of the congregation.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}} The ''mihrab'' started became part of a mosque during the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad period]] and its form is standardised during the [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid period]]; before that, the qibla of a mosque is known from the orientation of one of its walls, called the qibla wall. The term ''mihrab'' itself is only attested once in the Quran, but it refers to a place of prayer of the [[Israelites]] rather than a part of a mosque.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}}{{efn|This reference occurs in {{Cite Quran|19|11|style=nosup}}}}  The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt, one of the oldest mosques, is known to have been originally built without a ''mihrab'', even though now one has been added.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=4}}\n\n===''Ayn al-ka'bah'' and ''jihat al-ka'bah''===\n''Ayn al-ka'bah'' is facing the qibla so that an imaginary line extending from the person's line of sight would pass through the Ka'bah. This manner of observing the qibla is easily done inside the Great Mosque of Mecca and its surroundings, but given that the Ka'bah is less than {{conv|20|m|ft}} wide, this is virtually impossible from further locations.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=104\u2013105}} For example, from Medina\u2014with a {{conv|338|km|mi}} straight-line distance from the Ka'bah\u2014a 1\u00b0 deviation from the precise imaginary line\u2014an error hardly noticeable when setting one's prayer mat or assuming one's posture\u2014results in some {{convert|5.9|km|mi}} shift from the site of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=137}} This effect is amplified when further than Mecca:{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=134}} from [[Jakarta]], Indonesia\u2014some {{conv|7900|km|mi}} away, a 1\u00b0 deviation causes more than {{conv|100|km|mi}} shift, and even an [[arc second]]'s deviation\u2014{{nowrap|({{frac|1|3600}} of a degree)}}\u2014 causes more than {{conv|100|m|ft}} of shift from the location of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} In comparison, the construction process of a mosque can easily introduce up to 5\u00b0 error from the calculated qibla, and the installation of prayer rugs inside the mosque as indicators for worshippers can add up to a further 5\u00b0 deviation from the mosque's orientation.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\nA minority of Islamic religious scholars\u2014for example [[Ibn Arabi]]\u2014considers ''ayn al-ka'bah'' to be obligatory during the ritual prayer, while others consider it only obligatory when one is able. For locations further than Mecca, scholars such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Al-Qurtubi]] argue that it is permissible to assume ''jihat al-ka'bah'', facing only the general direction of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=92, 95}}  Some further argues that the ritual condition of facing the qibla is already fulfilled simply when the imaginary line to the Ka'bah is within one's field of vision.{{sfn|King|1996|p=134}} Therefore, for instance, there are legal opinions that accept the entire southeastern quadrant in [[Al-Andalus]] (historical Spain and Portugal), and the southwestern quadrant in [[Central Asia]], to be valid qibla.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}} Arguments for the validity of ''jihat al-Ka'bah'' include the wording of the Quran which only commands Muslims to \"turn [one's] face\" toward the Great Mosque, and to avoid the impossible requirement which would result if ''ayn al-Ka'bah'' were to be obligatory in all places.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=95}} The [[Shafi'i school]] of Islamic law, as codified in [[Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi]]'s ''Kitab al-Tanbih fi'l-Fiqh'', argues that one must follow the qibla indicated by the local mosque when one is not near Mecca or, when not near a mosque, ask a trustworthy person.

Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side by side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Directions described as the qiblas of the companions include due south in Syria and Palestine,{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}} the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132, also figure 4.2 in p. 131}}\n\n== Development of methods ==\n=== Pre-astronomy ===\nThe determination of qibla is an important problems for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla in order to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques.{{sfn|King|1996|p=128}} When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the [[Hejaz]] region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims have reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new places.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013132}} Mathematical methods based on astronomy would only develop at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth and even then they were not initially popular. Therefore, early Muslims relied on non-astronomical methods.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThere is a wide range of traditional methods in determining the qibla in the early Islamic period, resulting in different directions even from the same place. In addition to due south (used because it was the direction to which Muhammad prayed from Medina) and directions known as the qiblas of the companions (varies by place), the Arabs also knew a form of \"folk\" astronomy\u2014called so by [[David A. King (historian)|David A.

Other places, like the United States and Canada, have only had large Muslim communities in the past several decades, and the determination of qibla can be a matter of debate.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} The [[Islamic Center of Washington|Islamic Center of Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because [[Washington, D.C.]]'s latitude is 17\u00b030\u2032 more northerly than that of Mecca. Even though line drawn on world maps\u2014such as those using the Mercator projection\u2014would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, astronomical calculations using the great circle method do yield a north-of-east direction (56\u00b033\u2032).{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction in world maps.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} As the Muslim community grew and the number of mosque increased, in 1978 an American Muslim scientist S. Kamal Abdali, wrote an article arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method, which identifies the shortest path to Mecca.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Abdali's conclusion was widely circulated and then  accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a result.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} In 1990, two religious scholars Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla,{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}} and eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=57}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nVariation of the qibla also occurs in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest world Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201425\u00b0 north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=59\u201360}} However, the qibla is often traditionally known as simply 'the west', resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset\u2014which slightly varies throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono ''et al.'' argues that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a \"spiritual prerequisite\" than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Ka'bah itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} On the other hands, Muhammad Hadi Bashori opined that \"correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing,\" and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=60\u201361}} In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla has also occurred in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of [[Muhammadiyah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca he found that mosques in the royal capital of [[Yogyakarta]] had inaccurate qiblas, including the [[Kauman Great Mosque]] which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla was opposed by the traditional ulama of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s and later the Kauman Great Mosque too would be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.{{sfn|Kersten|2017|p=130}}{{sfn|Nashir|2015|p=77}}\n\n=== Outer space ===\n[[File:ISS Aug2005.jpg|thumb|The spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] started discussion about Islamic religious practices in space, including the determination of qibla.]]\nThe issue of qibla from outer space publicly arose before the spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]], a Malaysian surgeon who is a devout Muslim, to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on October 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} The ISS orbits the earth in high speed so that the direction to Mecca changes significantly in matters of seconds.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before his departure, Sheikh Muzsaphar requested guidance from Malaysian religious authorities about the performance of Islamic practices in space, including how to pray, fast, and determine the qibla. In its response, the Malaysian National Fatwa Council recommended four options in regard to the qibla, in order of priority: 1) the Ka'bah itself 2) the projection of the Ka'bah into space 3) the Earth 4) \"wherever\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} The authors of the fatwa intended that it will also be used as guidelines for future Muslim astronauts, and it has been translated into multiple languages.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} In line with the Malaysian fatwa council, other Muslim scholars argue for the importance of flexibility and adapting the qibla requirement to what an astronaut is capable of fulfilling. Khaleel Muhammad of the [[San Diego State University]] opined \"God does not take a person to task for that which is beyond his/her ability to work with\" and Abdali argued that concentration during a prayer is more important than the exact orientation, and suggest keeping the qibla direction at the start of a prayer instead of \"worrying about possible changes in position\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before Sheikh Muszaphar's mission, at least eight Muslims had flown to space, but none of them publicly discussed issues relating to worship in space.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=109}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Black Stone]]\n*[[Craig retroazimuthal projection]]\n*[[Haram (site)#Holy site|Holy site]]\n**[[Holiest sites in Islam]]\n*''[[Mizrah|Mizr\u00e2\u1e25]]'', the [[Judaism|Jewish]] equivalent of the Qiblah\n*''[[Qiblih]]'', the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] equivalent\n*[[List of Muslim astronauts#Praying towards Mecca in space|Praying towards Mecca in space]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n==References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal|title=Services and Applications Based on Mobile User's Location Detection and Prediction|first1=Mohammed|last1=Abo-Zahhad|first2=Sabah M.|last2=Ahmed|first3=Mohamed|last3=Mourad|journal=International Journal of Communications, Network and System Sciences|volume=6|issue=4|year=2013|doi=10.4236/ijcns.2013.64020|issn=1913-3723 |ref=harv|publisher=Scientific Research Publishing|pages=167\u2013175|doi-access=free}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Calculating an Azimuth from One Location to Another A Case Study in Determining the Qibla to Makkah|first1=Ghazy|last1=Almakky|first2=John|last2=Snyder|journal=Cartographica: The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization | volume =33| issue =2 | year = 1996 | publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]] | issn=0317-7173 | pages = 29\u201336 | ref=harv |doi = 10.3138/C567-3003-1225-M204}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bilici|first=Mucahit|title=Finding Mecca in America: How Islam Is Becoming an American Religion|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-GLAV-KTtQ0C|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-92287-4}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cSO9zh61AGEC|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46578-6}}\n* {{cite magazine | title = A Muslim Astronaut's Dilemma: How to Face Mecca From Space | magazine = [[WIRED (magazine)|WIRED]] | first=Patrick | last=Di Justo | year = 2007  | url = https://www.wired.com/2007/09/mecca-in-orbit/ | publisher = [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hadi Bashori|first=Muhammad|title=Penanggalan Islam|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9YhKDwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Elex Media Komputindo|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-602-02-3675-9|language=id}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hadi Bashori|first=Muhammad|title=Pengantar Ilmu Falak|url=https://books.google.com/?id=erLqDAAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Pustaka Al Kautsar|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-979-592-701-3|language=id}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Mohammad |last=Ilyas|title=A modern guide to astronomical calculations of Islamic calendar, times & qibla|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4mrvAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|location=Kuala Lumpur|publisher=Berita Publishing|oclc=13512629|isbn=9789679690095}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kersten|first=Carool |title=History of Islam in Indonesia: Unity in Diversity|year=2017|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-8187-7}}\n* {{Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition|volume=5|title=\u1e32ibla: Astronomical Aspects |page=83\u201388|first=David A.|last=King|authorlink=David A.

The original series, '''''The $10,000 Pyramid''''', debuted on March 26, 1973,<ref name=EW>{{cite news|title=A Dick Clark appreciation: The deceptively laid-back, conservative revolutionary|author=Ken Tucker|date=April 18, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-american-bandstand-pyramid-rockin-eve/|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> and spawned seven subsequent ''Pyramid'' series. Most later series featured a full title format matching the original series, with the title reflecting an increasing top prize. The game features two contestants, each paired with a celebrity. Contestants attempt to guess a series of words or phrases based on descriptions given to them by their teammates. The title refers to the show's pyramid-shaped gameboard, featuring six categories arranged in a triangular fashion. The various ''Pyramid'' series have won a total of nine [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]]s for Outstanding Game Show, second only to ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', which has won 13.\n\n[[Dick Clark]] is the host most commonly associated with the show, having hosted the network daytime version from 1973 to 1980 (which moved from CBS to ABC in 1974, and increased its namesake top prize from $10,000 to $20,000 in 1976) and its revival from 1982 to 1988 on CBS ('''''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'''''). \nClark also hosted two weeknight syndicated versions, '''''The $50,000 Pyramid''''' in 1981 and '''''The $100,000 Pyramid''''' from 1985 to 1988 (concurrent with the daytime show).\n\n[[Bill Cullen]] hosted the first weekly nighttime version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' from 1974 to 1979. [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] hosted a revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 1991, and [[Donny Osmond]] hosted a version simply titled '''''Pyramid''''' from 2002 to 2004; both were five-nights-a-week affairs. [[Game Show Network|GSN]]'s '''''The Pyramid''''', hosted by [[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]], who now is an executive at format owner, [[Sony Pictures Television]], aired a single forty-episode season in 2012.\n\nThe current revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' debuted June 26, 2016, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with [[Michael Strahan]] as host, and has aired on Sunday nights during the summer months since, completing its fourth season in September 2019.\n\nOn November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season.  Originally set for June 2020, Season 5 has been indefinitely delayed as a byproduct of the [[COVID-19]] outbreak as production was to have started in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Renews \"Summer Fun & Games\" for 2020|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/11/20/abc-renews-summer-fun-and-games-for-2020-867314/20191120abc01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n<REF>[https://tvline.com/2020/04/14/press-your-luck-season-2-premiere-date-abc-match-game/]</REF> <REF>[http://buzzerblog.com/2020/03/17/upcoming-game-show-schedules-impacted-by-coronavirus/] </REF>\n\n==History==\n===Broadcast history===\n[[File:Dick Clark $10000 Pyramid.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Dick Clark as host of ''The $10,000 Pyramid''.]]\n''The $10,000 Pyramid'', with host [[Dick Clark]], made its network debut on March 26, 1973<ref name=EW/> and was a ratings hit, sustaining its ratings even when episodes were delayed or preempted by the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] hearings. A year later, the ratings temporarily declined (against the original version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' on [[NBC]]) and CBS canceled it. The show was quickly picked up by ABC and began airing on that network on May 6, 1974. As per CBS custom at the time with celebrity game shows, three weeks of episodes for CBS were taped in [[Hollywood]] at [[CBS Television City]], Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows |title=Shows |publisher=CBS Television City |date=1954-09-07 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> The remainder of the CBS episodes originated in New York City at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], moving to ABC's Elysee Theatre after ''Pyramid'' switched networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2931|title=Elysee Theatre|website=Cinematreasures.org}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on January 19, 1976, the series doubled its top prize and was retitled ''The $20,000 Pyramid''. From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became ''Junior Partner Pyramid'', which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative. Its last episode aired June 27, 1980, with ''[[Family Feud]]'' subsequently moving up a half-hour to take over the 12:00 noon (EST) slot formerly occupied by ''The $20,000 Pyramid''.\n[[Image:$25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title card of the 1980s ''(New) $25,000 Pyramid''.]]\nOn September 20, 1982, the series returned to the CBS daytime lineup as ''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'', again with Clark as host, but now taped in Los Angeles full-time at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 (currently used for ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price is Right]]'', now known as the \"[[Bob Barker]] Studio\") and remained there for the entire run up until December 31, 1987. ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' began airing in the series' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot the following Monday, but that show was canceled after 13 weeks of episodes. On April 4, 1988, ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' returned to the CBS daytime schedule, but only for 13 more weeks. The show's final episode aired on July 1. The following Monday, the show was replaced by a revival of ''Family Feud'' hosted by [[Ray Combs]].\n\nConcurrent with the network show's run, several nighttime versions of the show were sold to local stations through [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]: the original ''$25,000 Pyramid'' and ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' were taped in the Elysee Theatre in New York, and the original version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/81903/10-fun-facts-about-100000-pyramid|title=10 Fun Facts About '$100,000 Pyramid'|website=Mentalfloss.com|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> taped at Studio 33 in Hollywood. A revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', hosted by [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], ran from January until December 1991 and taped in Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\"/> ''Pyramid'', hosted by [[Donny Osmond]], ran from September 16, 2002 to September 10, 2004 and was taped at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. ''The Pyramid'' was taped at the [[CBS Studio Center]].  Strahan's ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' is taped at the ABC Television Center in New York.\n\n===Later developments===\nIn late 1996, [[Sony Pictures Television]] (then-[[Columbia TriStar Television]]) produced a pilot for a new version of ''Pyramid'', with [[Mark Walberg]] as host, which featured a format radically different from the earlier versions, including an increase of the number of celebrities to six, each of which would be assigned to a different main game subject. It did not sell, but Sony tried again the following year, this time with [[Chuck Woolery]] at the helm and a format closer to the original, although the six-celebrity motif from the previous pilot remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgameshows.net/x.php?show=Pyramid1997&sort=0|title=The Game Show Pilot Light: Pyramid (1997)}}</ref> This version also failed to sell, but two years later, after the success of its series ''[[Rock and Roll Jeopardy!]]'' on [[VH1]], Sony attempted to give ''Pyramid'' similar treatment with a 1999 pilot called ''Pyramid Rocks''. Hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], the format likewise attempted to incorporate music into the game, but proved no more successful than the previous two attempts at reviving the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2016/01/09/watch-celebrate-pyramids-return-with-the-unsold-vh1-pilot-pyramid-rocks/|title=Watch: Celebrate Pyramid's Return With the Unsold VH1 Pilot \"Pyramid Rocks\"}}</ref>\n\nFollowing CBS's cancellation of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' in April 2009, ''Pyramid'' was one of three potential series considered as a replacement for the veteran soap opera. (''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' and ''[[The Dating Game]] as The New Dating Game or The Newlywed Game or The New Newlywed Game'' were the other two, with a pilot shot for the former series.) During the tapings that took place in June of that year at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in New York, the top prize was raised to a potential $1,000,000 with a tournament format similar to the $100,000 format.  [[Dean Cain]] and [[Tim Vincent]] were tapped as hosts of the pilots, with ''$50,000'' announcer Alan Kalter returning, and Sony Pictures game show legend [[Ken Jennings]] served as a panelist in the pilots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/set-report-from-the-1000000-pyramid|title=Set Report from \"The $1,000,000 Pyramid\" |date=June 25, 2009|website=Buzzerblog.com|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCBS passed on ''Pyramid'' and opted to pick up ''Let's Make a Deal'', hosted by [[Wayne Brady]], as ''Guiding Light's'' replacement. Several months later, in December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of another long-running soap opera, ''[[As the World Turns]]''. ''Pyramid'' was once again among the series being considered as a potential replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/b/2009/12/08/will-we-get-pyramid-back-after-all-atwt-is-toast.htm |title=About.com\u2014New York Times\u2014Will We Get Pyramid Back After All? |publisher=Gameshows.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> CBS ordered a third pilot on April 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ib5454b923e9fb7435165d866afd06e1c |title=CBS orders 'Pyramid' pilot| accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> [[Andy Richter]] was identified as a potential host.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/andy-richter-wrapping-deal-to-host-new-version-of-pyramid-for-cbs.html | title=Andy Richter wrapping deal to host new version of 'Pyramid' for CBS| work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>[http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/andy-richter-is-the-host-of-cbss-pyramid/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135239/http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/andy-richter-is-the-host-of-cbss-pyramid/|date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2011, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] announced development of a possible new version of ''Pyramid'', again to be hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/18/tnt-and-tbs-announce-extensive-slate-of-new-projects-from-top-talents-561104/20110518turner01/|title=TNT and TBS Announce Extensive Slate of New Projects from Top Talents |date=18 May 2011 |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> It was later announced{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} that the show was not picked up.\n\nAnother pilot, titled ''The Pyramid'', was taped on June 16, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/buzzerblog/status/201396898345652224|title=buzzerblog (buzzerblog) on Twitter |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref> On July 12, 2012, GSN announced ''The Pyramid'' had been picked up and would premiere on the network on September 3, with [[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]] hosting the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-premiere-pyramid-monday-september-3 |title=GSN Announces Premiere of ''The Pyramid'' on Monday, September 3 |publisher=GSN Corporate |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014125159/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-premiere-pyramid-monday-september-3 |archivedate=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> The series ran for 40 episodes before being cancelled later in the year.\n\nOn January 9, 2016, ABC announced a revival of the series, specifically the ''$100,000'' format, had been greenlit and set to air during the summer of 2016. This version also marked the return of the show to New York City, where it had originally been produced in the 1970s. The first season comprised ten hour-long episodes, with [[Michael Strahan]] serving as host.  Each episode consists of two full games.  Two introductions and two closings are taped with ability to air either;  as with ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and ''[[Match Game]]'', each game is its own 30-minute episode, and the introduction and closing aired depends if one game is the first or the second game to air in a single 60-minute block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/abc-is-reviving-game-show-classic-pyramid.html|title=ABC is Reviving Game-Show Classic $100,000 Pyramid|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture.com]]|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=\u2018Pyramid\u2019 builds pacts|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 9, 2016 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series premiered on June 26 of that year, airing as part of ABC's \"Sunday Fun & Games\" lineup at 9:00pm ET/8:00pm CT (along with the [[Steve Harvey]]-hosted ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and the [[Alec Baldwin]]-hosted ''[[Match Game]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/04/19/abc-announces-its-2016-summer-primetime-schedule-468314/20160419abc03/|title=Breaking News \u2013 ABC Announces Its 2016 Summer Primetime Schedule {{!}}|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=Futon Media|access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-orders-100000-pyramid-revival-853545|title=ABC Orders '$100,000 Pyramid' Revival Hosted by Michael Strahan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2016|first=Kate|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=June 26, 2016|last=Stanhope}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid-game-show-abc-michael-strahan-1201675892/|title=ABC Bringing Back \u2018Pyramid\u2019 Game Show with Host Michael Strahan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Elizabeth|date=January 9, 2016|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|last=Wagmeister|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/08/100000-pyramid-reboot-michael-strahan-host-abc|title=ABC orders $100,000 Pyramid reboot with Michael Strahan as host|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Dan|date=January 8, 2016|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|last=Snierson|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref> On August 4, 2016, ABC renewed ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' for a second season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/abc-renews-game-shows-match-game-family-feud-100000-pyramid/|title=ABC Renews Game Shows \u2018Match Game,\u2019 \u2018Celebrity Family Feud,\u2019 \u2018$100,000 Pyramid\u2019'|work=[[TheWrap]]|first=Reid|last=Nakamura|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> On June 11, 2017, the show moved to 10/9 central in order to pair it up with the seed-funding reality competition show ''[[Steve Harvey's Funderdome]]'' along with the third season of ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''.

This was also paired up with the fourth season of ''Celebrity Feud'' hosted by [[Steve Harvey]], along with the third season of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' hosted by [[Anthony Anderson]]. In this format, the host opens each show introducing the celebrity guests, each of whom then introduces his or her partner/contestant by first name only.\n\n===Other personnel===\n[[Bob Clayton]] was the series' original announcer and performed these duties until his death in 1979. [[Alan Kalter]] and Steve O'Brien shared the primary announcer role until ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' ended production in 1981. Substitutes included [[Fred Foy]], John Causier, Dick Heatherton, [[Scott Vincent]], and Ed Jordan.\n\nWhen the series was revived and production moved to California in 1982, [[Jack Clark (television personality)|Jack Clark]] became the announcer and held the position until 1985. [[Johnny Gilbert]] became the primary announcer for ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' while [[Charlie O'Donnell]] took the job for ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' when it launched that fall. Both Gilbert and O'Donnell substituted for each other on their respective series; other substitutes included Jerry Bishop, [[Rod Roddy]], [[Bob Hilton]], [[Charlie Tuna]], and [[Dean Goss]]. For the 1991 revival, Gilbert and Goss were both featured announcers and frequent panelist [[Henry Polic II]] also announced for several weeks.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} [[John Cramer (announcer)|John Cramer]] announced the 2002\u201304 version, and [[JD Roberto]] announced ''The Pyramid'' (2012). The 2016 ABC primetime version is announced by Brad Abelle.\n\nMike Gargiulo directed through 1981, with Bruce Burmester replacing him until the end of the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}}\n\nThe original theme tune was \"Tuning Up\" by Ken Aldin. In 1982, it was replaced by an original, similarly-styled composition by [[Bob Cobert]], which was also used on the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} Barry Coffing and John Blaylock composed the theme and incidental music for the 2002\u201304 version, while Alan Ett composed a cover of Bob Cobert's 1982\u201391 theme for ''The Pyramid''. Bleeding Fingers Music composed a separate cover of Cobert's theme for the 2016 version.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Pyramid's gameboards, both in the main game and in the Winners' Circle bonus round, feature six categories arranged in a triangle (referred to as a pyramid), with three categories on the bottom row, two on the middle row, and one on the top. In the main game, a category's position on the board is arbitrary. In the Winners' Circle, categories become progressively more difficult the higher they are on the board.\n\n===Main game===\nTwo teams compete in the main game, each composed of a celebrity and a regular contestant.\n\n[[Image:Charles Siebert gives on The $25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Charles Siebert]] uses pantomime to describe \"lasso\" on ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1982.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the teams are shown six categories, whose titles gave vague clues to their possible meaning (for instance, \"I'm All Wet\" might pertain to things found in water). Once the category was chosen, its exact meaning is given (except in certain bonus situations where the meaning was not given and a cash/prize bonus won for completing all the clues). For up to 30 seconds, one contestant conveys to the other clues to a series of items belonging to a category. At this stage, the clue-giver could use whatever language they wanted, with the exclusion of saying any word that was part of the correct answer (for example, using \"high up\" for \"height\"); if the clue-giver gave such a clue, they were buzzed and that answer would be forfeited. The clue-giver could also include visual gestures and other non-verbal elements, and could also lead the player towards saying part of the answer to get them to say the correct answer.\n\nOne point is scored for each item correctly guessed. If a word is passed, the giver could not go back to that word, but if the receiver knows the word later on and guesses it, the team still earns a point (no sound effect was played, in order to avoid a distraction). Since the 2002 Osmond version, a team that passes on any words could return to them if time permitted, but if a word is guessed correctly after it had been passed, it did not count until the word was returned to and correctly guessed then.\n\nWhen ''The $10,000 Pyramid'' launched on CBS, there were eight possible items in a category. This was reduced to seven when the show moved to ABC, and this became the standard used for every subsequent series with two exceptions. When ''The $20,000 Pyramid'' briefly switched to its ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' format in November 1979, the time limit was increased to 35 seconds. The Donny Osmond-hosted ''Pyramid'' used categories with six items, with 20 seconds given to guess all six. Illegal clues, such as using part of the word in the description, or conveying its essence, results in the word being thrown out (denoted by a rapid \"cuckoo\" sound).\n\nOriginally, the celebrity gave the clues in both the first and third rounds, and the contestant in the second round. This soon changed to having the contestant decide whether to give or receive in the third round (except for the Osmond version, which used the original \"celebrity-contestant-celebrity\" giving pattern). The teams alternated in the first two rounds, and the team with the lower score played first in the third round. Whoever had the higher score after three rounds advanced to the Winners' Circle. In the 1970s, 1980s and 2016 versions, in the rare event that contestants were mathematically unable to at least tie their opponent before the opponent has had his/her last turn (or even rarer, before that point), the game ends and the remaining categories are left unplayed, unless one of them concealed a bonus.\n\nDuring the later years of the ABC run, if either team achieved a perfect score of 21, it was worth a $1,000 bonus ($500 during the ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era), later changed to a prize near the end of the run, while the 1977\u201378 season of the Cullen version likewise offered a $2,100 bonus for a perfect score.\n\nOriginally, if a tie occurred after the rounds were completed, the host gave the team who caused the tie a choice between two letters of the alphabet, and the team then played a round with seven words each beginning with that letter. The opposing team was then given seven words with the other letter. Tiebreaker rounds were played until the tie was broken, though the rules were later changed to award the victory to whichever team completed its own seven words faster, if both teams did so. In the 2016 Strahan version, if both teams achieve the same score, the team to do so in the shorter time is declared the winner, with a tiebreaker round being played if the teams match each other for both score and time.\n\nBeginning in January 1984, if both teams managed a \"perfect game\" by each scoring 21 points, the contestant whose team won the tiebreaker originally received a new car, but this was changed to a $5,000 cash bonus by September of that year. This bonus was also used on the 1980s incarnation of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''.\n\n====Bonus Cards====\nThroughout the 1970s, a random category during the main game doubled as the \"Big 7\", meaning that the contestant originally received a prize if all seven words were guessed correctly, but this was soon changed to a $500 cash bonus. On the Bill Cullen-hosted ''$25,000 Pyramid'', the Big 7 payoff was $1,000 when it was first introduced during the second season, but this was later replaced by a \"Big Money Card\" worth varying amounts of cash from $1,000 to $5,000 (though the maximum amount was later dropped to $4,000); for the final season, the Big 7 returned, and was always played for a [[Chevrolet Chevette]].\n\nDuring the short-lived ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, there was no official bonus card; rather, each of the two teams selected one category from either of the day's two games to designate as their \"Bonus 7\", which otherwise worked the same as the Big 7, right down to the $500 bonus. However, unlike any other version, all bonuses won in this manner counted towards a team's score for the day.\n\nThe short-lived ''$50,000 Pyramid'' used no bonus cards, but added a feature called \"The Player of the Week\", in which the contestant who successfully conveyed or identified all seven answers in the fastest time during a main game round that week received a trip for two to [[Europe]], and later returned to compete in the show's $50,000 tournament. If two players were tied during a particular show or week, the tied players would return at the beginning or end of an episode and play a standard tiebreaker round to determine a winner.\n\nSimilar to the earlier Big 7, a new bonus called the \"7\u201311\" was introduced in April 1983 for the CBS version, hidden behind one category in the first round; if all seven words were guessed, the contestant won an $1,100 bonus. Initially, the contestant could choose to play for either this bonus or $50 per correct guess, but this option was dropped from January 1985 onward in favor of the all-or-nothing approach.\n\nBeginning in 1982, a random category in the second round was designated as the \"Mystery 7\", in which the host did not reveal the topic of the category until after the fact, and correctly guessing all seven words awarded a prize. The Mystery 7 was initially shown to the teams as one of the six categories, but from April 1984 onward, it was hidden behind a category name. This is the only bonus used in the 2016 edition, during the second round of each half.\n\nFor a brief time in early 1983, the Mystery 7 was replaced by a format similar to the earlier \"Player of the Week\" feature from ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', in which the player who had the fastest main game round during the week would win a Greek cruise. However, this bonus was dropped after only three weeks, and the Mystery 7 reinstated.\n\nThe John Davidson-hosted version had its own similar bonuses: \"Gamble for a Grand\"/\"Gamble for a Trip\" offered the choice to reduce the round's time limit from 30 to 25 seconds to win $1,000 cash or a trip, respectively, and \"Double Trouble\" offered the team 45 seconds to guess seven two-word responses for a $500 bonus. \n\nThe Donny Osmond-hosted version had only one bonus: \"Super Six\", which was featured in both games each day, and awarded the contestant a prize if the team managed to get all six words within the 20 seconds.\n\nOn the GSN version, there were no bonus cards, but sweeping a category awarded a $500 bonus and added $5,000 to the Winner's Circle bank (see below).\n\n===Winners' Circle===\n[[Image:Kathy Najimy on The $100,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contestant, restrained in her seat, gives clues to [[Kathy Najimy]] in the Winners' Circle on ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 2016.]]\nThe winning team from the main game plays \"The Winners' Circle,\" in which the goal is to communicate six categories of increasing difficulty within 60 seconds, using only lists of words and phrases that fit them. During the show's original run on CBS from 1973 to 1974, hand gestures of any kind were permitted in this round. However, when the show moved to ABC in 1974, hand gestures became strictly forbidden, and all subsequent editions of the show included wrist straps attached to the chair to help contestants abide by this rule.  One team member gives clues to the category currently in play, while the other tries to guess it. An illegal clue (descriptions, saying a form of the answer, or a direct synonym) or hand gesture results in the category being thrown out, thus disqualifying the contestant from winning the grand prize; however, the contestant is still allowed to play the remainder of the Winners' Circle, either until time runs out or until the remaining categories have been correctly guessed. If all six categories are guessed before time runs out, the contestant wins the top prize; if not, he/she wins money for the guessed categories.{{sfn|Graham|1988|pages=181\u2013182}}{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013222}}{{sfn|Fabe|1979|pages=255\u2013259}} The clue-giver can pass on a category and then return to it after playing through all six, if time allows.\n\nThe values for individual categories during standard gameplay are shown in the table below. Category numbering proceeds across the bottom row of the pyramid (left/center/right), then the middle (left/right), and finally the single one at the peak.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"8\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Version\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''1st'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" |''' 2nd'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''3rd'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''4th'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''5th'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''6th'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $10,000/$20,000/$50,000/Junior Pyramid''\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $50\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' (1970s)\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''All-Star Junior Pyramid'' Special\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' (1979)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $125\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $150\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $175\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The (New) $25,000/$100,000 Pyramid'' (1982\u20131991)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $50\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $150\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | ''Pyramid'' (2002\u201304)\n| Regular gameplay\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n|-\n| Six-player tournament/four-player semifinals\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,500\n|-\n| Finals match of a four-player tournament\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $5,000\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The Pyramid'' (2012)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $400\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $750\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' (2016)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $3,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $4,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $5,000\n|-\n|}\n\n===Returning champions and winnings limits===\nOn the 1970s daytime version, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until they were defeated or won the Winners' Circle. Under the $10,000 format, a contestant who won the Winners' Circle was allowed to keep all earlier winnings. Under the $20,000 format, the contestant's total was merely augmented to the amount won in the Winners' Circle. The syndicated versions featured no returning champions prior to 1985.\n\nAfter the top prize on the 1970s daytime show was increased to $20,000, the Winners' Circle structure likewise changed, with a champion playing for $10,000 on their first attempt, $15,000 on their second attempt, and $20,000 for their third and all subsequent efforts. During the brief ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, a team's first visit to the Winners' Circle was worth $2,500, while the second was worth $5,000.\n\nDuring the 1970s syndicated version, if a contestant won a bonus prize, then went on to win the $25,000 top prize, the value of the bonus (either the additional bonus cash, or the value of the car offered during the final season) was deducted from the champion's total, leaving them with exactly $25,000. This version did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn the short-lived 1981 version, the first Winners' Circle was worth $5,000; if the same player made it to the second Winners' Circle, it was played for a total of $10,000. This version also did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn all versions from 1982 onward, all main game bonus winnings remained intact in the event of a $25,000 win. On the $25,000 and $100,000 versions of the show, the same two contestants competed for both halves of the episode. A contestant who won the first of the two games on the episode played the Winners' Circle for $10,000. A contestant who won both games played the second Winners' Circle for a total of $25,000 (e.g., if a contestant won $10,000 in the first Winners' Circle, the second was worth an additional $15,000 to the contestant). On all versions from 1982 to 1991, a contestant who won both games of an episode became the champion and returned on the next show. If each contestant won one game, the contestant who won the higher amount in the Winners' Circle became champion (winnings from the various main game bonuses were not considered as part of the \"score\" winnings). If both contestants won equal amounts of money in the Winners' Circle (including $10,000 wins), both returned on the next show.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until defeated or a maximum of five episodes. Champions on the CBS version also retired after exceeding the network's winnings limit. This was originally $25,000, but was increased to $50,000 on October 22, 1984 (episode #0542) and to $75,000 on September 29, 1986 (episode #1041). Contestants were allowed to keep a maximum of $25,000 in excess of the limit.\n\nOn ''Pyramid'', the goal was once again to try to win $25,000. However, this required a contestant to get to and win the Winners' Circle twice. If the contestant made a second trip without having won the first, he/she was given another chance at $10,000. If the contestant managed to win both, he/she won the $25,000 and automatically qualified for the $100,000 tournament.\n\nOn ''The Pyramid'', each Winners' Circle was played for a base of $10,000. For each category that the contestant and celebrity swept in the front game, a $500 bonus was awarded to the contestant and an additional $5,000 was added to the potential prize, with the maximum prize for a trip to the Winners' Circle being $25,000 for each contestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2012/07/exclusive-info-gsn-pyramid/ |title=BUZZERBLOG Exclusive Info on 2012 GSN Revival |website=Buzzerblog.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Both ''Pyramid'' and ''The Pyramid'' did not have returning champions.\n\nThe 2016 ABC format consists of hour-long episodes, each containing two complete pairs of games. The contestant who wins the first game of a pair plays the Winners' Circle for a prize of $50,000. If the same contestant wins both games, he/she plays the second Winners' Circle for an additional $100,000, leading to a potential maximum total of $150,000.<ref>{{Cite episode|series=The $100,000 Pyramid|date=10 July 2016|network=ABC|number=3|time=42:29}}</ref> Two new contestants compete in each half of an episode; there are no returning champions.\n\n===Tournaments===\nOn ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', tournaments started with eight past \"Players of the Week\" competing over the course of a week. The quarterfinals were played on Monday and Tuesday, with two different contestants in each half, and the winner of each game would advance to the semi-finals after playing the Pyramid for $5,000. On Wednesday and Thursday, each match would have two semi-finalists playing two games against each other, with players winning one game playing for $5,000, and players winning both games in the same show playing for a total of $10,000 (as it was during regular play). The two players who won the most money would compete in the finals, while the losing contestants from the semi-finals competed in a \"wild card\" match on Friday to determine who would join them. Starting the following Monday, two finalists played one game, and the winner played the Winners' Circle for $50,000. If the grand prize was not won, that player played the next game against the finalist who sat out the previous game, continuing in this manner throughout the week until someone won in the Winners' Circle. When playing for $50,000, an illegal clue immediately ended the round, and no money was awarded for each individual category.\n\nOn the 1985\u201391 version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', the three contestants who completed the Winners' Circle in the shortest lengths of time qualified for a $100,000 tournament, which was held every few weeks. During the tournament, all front game bonuses were removed except the $5,000 bonus for breaking a 21\u201321 tie. The first contestant to complete the Winners' Circle won the $100,000 grand prize, ending the tournament. If neither contestant did so on a particular episode, the one who accumulated more money in the Winners' Circle returned on the next show to compete against the contestant who had not played on that episode (in the event of a tie, a [[coin toss]] determined who returned). If one of the three contestants won the $100,000 in the first Winners' Circle of an episode, the other two played against each other in the second half and that winner played for $10,000 in the Winners' Circle.\n\nOn the Osmond version, tournaments lasted for exactly three episodes, and rules varied depending on whether four or six champions had qualified. During a six-player tournament, each contestant's first attempt at the Winners' Circle was worth $25,000. If $25,000 was won in the first half and the same player returned to the Winners' Circle, that contestant played for an additional $75,000 and the tournament title. If the tournament ended with no players having won both Winners' Circles in one show, either the contestant who won $25,000 in the fastest time or the player who won the most money would have his or her tournament winnings augmented to $100,000. In a four-player tournament, the first two semi-finalists competed on day one and the other two semi-finalists on day two, with each Winners' Circle attempt worth $25,000. The top two winners then returned to compete in the finals, where each Winners' Circle victory was worth an additional $50,000, for a maximum payoff of $150,000 if any of the contestants managed a clean sweep.\n\nUnlike the Clark and Davidson versions, the \"Super Six\" bonus remained in play during the Osmond era tournaments and was played for larger prizes than usual.\n\n==International versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:left; line-height:16px; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Donny Osmond hosted a short-lived 2007 revival, which used a similar set and the same music package as the 2002 American revival hosted by Osmond.\n\nIn 2009, Sony created an Australian version of ''The Junior Partner Pyramid'' called simply ''[[Pyramid (Australian game show)|Pyramid]]''. This version was hosted by [[Shura Taft]] until 2012, with Graham Matters taking over the following year.\n\nA German version titled ''[[:de:Die Pyramide (Fernsehsendung)|Die Pyramide]]'' aired on [[ZDF]] from 1979 to 1994, and was hosted by [[Dieter Thomas Heck]].

Beginning with the fourth edition, like its TV counterpart, the title and top payoff changed to ''The $20,000 Pyramid'', while the final edition was titled ''The $50,000 Pyramid''. However, due to concerns about players easily memorizing possible Winners' Circle subjects, the format of the board game's Winners' Circle endgame was changed to mirror that of the TV version's main game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2015/06/08/why-did-the-board-game-version-of-the-25000-pyramid-not-actually-have-a-pyramid-in-it/|title=Why Did the Board Game Version of the $25,000 Pyramid Not Actually Have a Pyramid In It?|date=8 June 2015|website=Legendsrevealed.com|accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Games released a new home version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1986,<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Board-Game-1986-Clark/dp/B001TKV6WG] {{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref> this time using the actual Winners' Circle rules and format, which was also given to all contestants who appeared on both the daytime and nighttime versions for most of 1987.

The original series, '''''The $10,000 Pyramid''''', debuted on March 26, 1973,<ref name=EW>{{cite news|title=A Dick Clark appreciation: The deceptively laid-back, conservative revolutionary|author=Ken Tucker|date=April 18, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-american-bandstand-pyramid-rockin-eve/|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> and spawned seven subsequent ''Pyramid'' series. Most later series featured a full title format matching the original series, with the title reflecting an increasing top prize. The game features two contestants, each paired with a celebrity. Contestants attempt to guess a series of words or phrases based on descriptions given to them by their teammates. The title refers to the show's pyramid-shaped gameboard, featuring six categories arranged in a triangular fashion. The various ''Pyramid'' series have won a total of nine [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]]s for Outstanding Game Show, second only to ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', which has won 13.\n\n[[Dick Clark]] is the host most commonly associated with the show, having hosted the network daytime version from 1973 to 1980 (which moved from CBS to ABC in 1974, and increased its namesake top prize from $10,000 to $20,000 in 1976) and its revival from 1982 to 1988 on CBS ('''''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'''''). \nClark also hosted two weeknight syndicated versions, '''''The $50,000 Pyramid''''' in 1981 and '''''The $100,000 Pyramid''''' from 1985 to 1988 (concurrent with the daytime show).\n\n[[Bill Cullen]] hosted the first weekly nighttime version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' from 1974 to 1979. [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] hosted a revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 1991, and [[Donny Osmond]] hosted a version simply titled '''''Pyramid''''' from 2002 to 2004; both were five-nights-a-week affairs. [[Game Show Network|GSN]]'s '''''The Pyramid''''', hosted by [[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]], who now is an executive at format owner, [[Sony Pictures Television]], aired a single forty-episode season in 2012.\n\nThe current revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' debuted June 26, 2016, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with [[Michael Strahan]] as host, and has aired on Sunday nights during the summer months since, completing its fourth season in September 2019.\n\nOn November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season.  Originally set for June 2020, Season 5 has been indefinitely delayed as a byproduct of the [[COVID-19]] outbreak as production was to have started in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Renews \"Summer Fun & Games\" for 2020|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/11/20/abc-renews-summer-fun-and-games-for-2020-867314/20191120abc01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n<REF>[https://tvline.com/2020/04/14/press-your-luck-season-2-premiere-date-abc-match-game/]</REF> <REF>[http://buzzerblog.com/2020/03/17/upcoming-game-show-schedules-impacted-by-coronavirus/] </REF>\n\n==History==\n===Broadcast history===\n[[File:Dick Clark $10000 Pyramid.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Dick Clark as host of ''The $10,000 Pyramid''.]]\n''The $10,000 Pyramid'', with host [[Dick Clark]], made its network debut on March 26, 1973<ref name=EW/> and was a ratings hit, sustaining its ratings even when episodes were delayed or preempted by the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] hearings. A year later, the ratings temporarily declined (against the original version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' on [[NBC]]) and CBS canceled it. The show was quickly picked up by ABC and began airing on that network on May 6, 1974. As per CBS custom at the time with celebrity game shows, three weeks of episodes for CBS were taped in [[Hollywood]] at [[CBS Television City]], Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows |title=Shows |publisher=CBS Television City |date=1954-09-07 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> The remainder of the CBS episodes originated in New York City at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], moving to ABC's Elysee Theatre after ''Pyramid'' switched networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2931|title=Elysee Theatre|website=Cinematreasures.org}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on January 19, 1976, the series doubled its top prize and was retitled ''The $20,000 Pyramid''. From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became ''Junior Partner Pyramid'', which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative. Its last episode aired June 27, 1980, with ''[[Family Feud]]'' subsequently moving up a half-hour to take over the 12:00 noon (EST) slot formerly occupied by ''The $20,000 Pyramid''.\n[[Image:$25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title card of the 1980s ''(New) $25,000 Pyramid''.]]\nOn September 20, 1982, the series returned to the CBS daytime lineup as ''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'', again with Clark as host, but now taped in Los Angeles full-time at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 (currently used for ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price is Right]]'', now known as the \"[[Bob Barker]] Studio\") and remained there for the entire run up until December 31, 1987. ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' began airing in the series' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot the following Monday, but that show was canceled after 13 weeks of episodes. On April 4, 1988, ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' returned to the CBS daytime schedule, but only for 13 more weeks. The show's final episode aired on July 1. The following Monday, the show was replaced by a revival of ''Family Feud'' hosted by [[Ray Combs]].\n\nConcurrent with the network show's run, several nighttime versions of the show were sold to local stations through [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]: the original ''$25,000 Pyramid'' and ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' were taped in the Elysee Theatre in New York, and the original version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/81903/10-fun-facts-about-100000-pyramid|title=10 Fun Facts About '$100,000 Pyramid'|website=Mentalfloss.com|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> taped at Studio 33 in Hollywood. A revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', hosted by [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], ran from January until December 1991 and taped in Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\"/> ''Pyramid'', hosted by [[Donny Osmond]], ran from September 16, 2002 to September 10, 2004 and was taped at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. ''The Pyramid'' was taped at the [[CBS Studio Center]].  Strahan's ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' is taped at the ABC Television Center in New York.\n\n===Later developments===\nIn late 1996, [[Sony Pictures Television]] (then-[[Columbia TriStar Television]]) produced a pilot for a new version of ''Pyramid'', with [[Mark Walberg]] as host, which featured a format radically different from the earlier versions, including an increase of the number of celebrities to six, each of which would be assigned to a different main game subject. It did not sell, but Sony tried again the following year, this time with [[Chuck Woolery]] at the helm and a format closer to the original, although the six-celebrity motif from the previous pilot remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgameshows.net/x.php?show=Pyramid1997&sort=0|title=The Game Show Pilot Light: Pyramid (1997)}}</ref> This version also failed to sell, but two years later, after the success of its series ''[[Rock and Roll Jeopardy!]]'' on [[VH1]], Sony attempted to give ''Pyramid'' similar treatment with a 1999 pilot called ''Pyramid Rocks''. Hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], the format likewise attempted to incorporate music into the game, but proved no more successful than the previous two attempts at reviving the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2016/01/09/watch-celebrate-pyramids-return-with-the-unsold-vh1-pilot-pyramid-rocks/|title=Watch: Celebrate Pyramid's Return With the Unsold VH1 Pilot \"Pyramid Rocks\"}}</ref>\n\nFollowing CBS's cancellation of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' in April 2009, ''Pyramid'' was one of three potential series considered as a replacement for the veteran soap opera. (''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' and ''[[The Dating Game]] as The New Dating Game or The Newlywed Game or The New Newlywed Game'' were the other two, with a pilot shot for the former series.) During the tapings that took place in June of that year at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in New York, the top prize was raised to a potential $1,000,000 with a tournament format similar to the $100,000 format.  [[Dean Cain]] and [[Tim Vincent]] were tapped as hosts of the pilots, with ''$50,000'' announcer Alan Kalter returning, and Sony Pictures game show legend [[Ken Jennings]] served as a panelist in the pilots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/set-report-from-the-1000000-pyramid|title=Set Report from \"The $1,000,000 Pyramid\" |date=June 25, 2009|website=Buzzerblog.com|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCBS passed on ''Pyramid'' and opted to pick up ''Let's Make a Deal'', hosted by [[Wayne Brady]], as ''Guiding Light's'' replacement. Several months later, in December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of another long-running soap opera, ''[[As the World Turns]]''. ''Pyramid'' was once again among the series being considered as a potential replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/b/2009/12/08/will-we-get-pyramid-back-after-all-atwt-is-toast.htm |title=About.com\u2014New York Times\u2014Will We Get Pyramid Back After All? |publisher=Gameshows.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> CBS ordered a third pilot on April 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ib5454b923e9fb7435165d866afd06e1c |title=CBS orders 'Pyramid' pilot| accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> [[Andy Richter]] was identified as a potential host.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/andy-richter-wrapping-deal-to-host-new-version-of-pyramid-for-cbs.html | title=Andy Richter wrapping deal to host new version of 'Pyramid' for CBS| work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>[http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/andy-richter-is-the-host-of-cbss-pyramid/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135239/http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/andy-richter-is-the-host-of-cbss-pyramid/|date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2011, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] announced development of a possible new version of ''Pyramid'', again to be hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/18/tnt-and-tbs-announce-extensive-slate-of-new-projects-from-top-talents-561104/20110518turner01/|title=TNT and TBS Announce Extensive Slate of New Projects from Top Talents |date=18 May 2011 |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> It was later announced{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} that the show was not picked up.\n\nAnother pilot, titled ''The Pyramid'', was taped on June 16, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/buzzerblog/status/201396898345652224|title=buzzerblog (buzzerblog) on Twitter |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref> On July 12, 2012, GSN announced ''The Pyramid'' had been picked up and would premiere on the network on September 3, with [[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]] hosting the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-premiere-pyramid-monday-september-3 |title=GSN Announces Premiere of ''The Pyramid'' on Monday, September 3 |publisher=GSN Corporate |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014125159/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-premiere-pyramid-monday-september-3 |archivedate=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> The series ran for 40 episodes before being cancelled later in the year.\n\nOn January 9, 2016, ABC announced a revival of the series, specifically the ''$100,000'' format, had been greenlit and set to air during the summer of 2016. This version also marked the return of the show to New York City, where it had originally been produced in the 1970s. The first season comprised ten hour-long episodes, with [[Michael Strahan]] serving as host.  Each episode consists of two full games.  Two introductions and two closings are taped with ability to air either;  as with ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and ''[[Match Game]]'', each game is its own 30-minute episode, and the introduction and closing aired depends if one game is the first or the second game to air in a single 60-minute block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/abc-is-reviving-game-show-classic-pyramid.html|title=ABC is Reviving Game-Show Classic $100,000 Pyramid|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture.com]]|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=\u2018Pyramid\u2019 builds pacts|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 9, 2016 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series premiered on June 26 of that year, airing as part of ABC's \"Sunday Fun & Games\" lineup at 9:00pm ET/8:00pm CT (along with the [[Steve Harvey]]-hosted ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and the [[Alec Baldwin]]-hosted ''[[Match Game]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/04/19/abc-announces-its-2016-summer-primetime-schedule-468314/20160419abc03/|title=Breaking News \u2013 ABC Announces Its 2016 Summer Primetime Schedule {{!}}|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=Futon Media|access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-orders-100000-pyramid-revival-853545|title=ABC Orders '$100,000 Pyramid' Revival Hosted by Michael Strahan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2016|first=Kate|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=June 26, 2016|last=Stanhope}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid-game-show-abc-michael-strahan-1201675892/|title=ABC Bringing Back \u2018Pyramid\u2019 Game Show with Host Michael Strahan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Elizabeth|date=January 9, 2016|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|last=Wagmeister|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/08/100000-pyramid-reboot-michael-strahan-host-abc|title=ABC orders $100,000 Pyramid reboot with Michael Strahan as host|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Dan|date=January 8, 2016|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|last=Snierson|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref> On August 4, 2016, ABC renewed ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' for a second season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/abc-renews-game-shows-match-game-family-feud-100000-pyramid/|title=ABC Renews Game Shows \u2018Match Game,\u2019 \u2018Celebrity Family Feud,\u2019 \u2018$100,000 Pyramid\u2019'|work=[[TheWrap]]|first=Reid|last=Nakamura|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> On June 11, 2017, the show moved to 10/9 central in order to pair it up with the seed-funding reality competition show ''[[Steve Harvey's Funderdome]]'' along with the third season of ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''.

This was also paired up with the fourth season of ''Celebrity Feud'' hosted by [[Steve Harvey]], along with the third season of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' hosted by [[Anthony Anderson]]. In this format, the host opens each show introducing the celebrity guests, each of whom then introduces his or her partner/contestant by first name only.\n\n===Other personnel===\n[[Bob Clayton]] was the series' original announcer and performed these duties until his death in 1979. [[Alan Kalter]] and Steve O'Brien shared the primary announcer role until ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' ended production in 1981. Substitutes included [[Fred Foy]], John Causier, Dick Heatherton, [[Scott Vincent]], and Ed Jordan.\n\nWhen the series was revived and production moved to California in 1982, [[Jack Clark (television personality)|Jack Clark]] became the announcer and held the position until 1985. [[Johnny Gilbert]] became the primary announcer for ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' while [[Charlie O'Donnell]] took the job for ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' when it launched that fall. Both Gilbert and O'Donnell substituted for each other on their respective series; other substitutes included Jerry Bishop, [[Rod Roddy]], [[Bob Hilton]], [[Charlie Tuna]], and [[Dean Goss]]. For the 1991 revival, Gilbert and Goss were both featured announcers and frequent panelist [[Henry Polic II]] also announced for several weeks.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} [[John Cramer (announcer)|John Cramer]] announced the 2002\u201304 version, and [[JD Roberto]] announced ''The Pyramid'' (2012). The 2016 ABC primetime version is announced by Brad Abelle.\n\nMike Gargiulo directed through 1981, with Bruce Burmester replacing him until the end of the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}}\n\nThe original theme tune was \"Tuning Up\" by Ken Aldin. In 1982, it was replaced by an original, similarly-styled composition by [[Bob Cobert]], which was also used on the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} Barry Coffing and John Blaylock composed the theme and incidental music for the 2002\u201304 version, while Alan Ett composed a cover of Bob Cobert's 1982\u201391 theme for ''The Pyramid''. Bleeding Fingers Music composed a separate cover of Cobert's theme for the 2016 version.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Pyramid's gameboards, both in the main game and in the Winners' Circle bonus round, feature six categories arranged in a triangle (referred to as a pyramid), with three categories on the bottom row, two on the middle row, and one on the top. In the main game, a category's position on the board is arbitrary. In the Winners' Circle, categories become progressively more difficult the higher they are on the board.\n\n===Main game===\nTwo teams compete in the main game, each composed of a celebrity and a regular contestant.\n\n[[Image:Charles Siebert gives on The $25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Charles Siebert]] uses pantomime to describe \"lasso\" on ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1982.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the teams are shown six categories, whose titles gave vague clues to their possible meaning (for instance, \"I'm All Wet\" might pertain to things found in water). Once the category was chosen, its exact meaning is given (except in certain bonus situations where the meaning was not given and a cash/prize bonus won for completing all the clues). For up to 30 seconds, one contestant conveys to the other clues to a series of items belonging to a category. At this stage, the clue-giver could use whatever language they wanted, with the exclusion of saying any word that was part of the correct answer (for example, using \"high up\" for \"height\"); if the clue-giver gave such a clue, they were buzzed and that answer would be forfeited. The clue-giver could also include visual gestures and other non-verbal elements, and could also lead the player towards saying part of the answer to get them to say the correct answer.\n\nOne point is scored for each item correctly guessed. If a word is passed, the giver could not go back to that word, but if the receiver knows the word later on and guesses it, the team still earns a point (no sound effect was played, in order to avoid a distraction). Since the 2002 Osmond version, a team that passes on any words could return to them if time permitted, but if a word is guessed correctly after it had been passed, it did not count until the word was returned to and correctly guessed then.\n\nWhen ''The $10,000 Pyramid'' launched on CBS, there were eight possible items in a category. This was reduced to seven when the show moved to ABC, and this became the standard used for every subsequent series with two exceptions. When ''The $20,000 Pyramid'' briefly switched to its ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' format in November 1979, the time limit was increased to 35 seconds. The Donny Osmond-hosted ''Pyramid'' used categories with six items, with 20 seconds given to guess all six. Illegal clues, such as using part of the word in the description, or conveying its essence, results in the word being thrown out (denoted by a rapid \"cuckoo\" sound).\n\nOriginally, the celebrity gave the clues in both the first and third rounds, and the contestant in the second round. This soon changed to having the contestant decide whether to give or receive in the third round (except for the Osmond version, which used the original \"celebrity-contestant-celebrity\" giving pattern). The teams alternated in the first two rounds, and the team with the lower score played first in the third round. Whoever had the higher score after three rounds advanced to the Winners' Circle. In the 1970s, 1980s and 2016 versions, in the rare event that contestants were mathematically unable to at least tie their opponent before the opponent has had his/her last turn (or even rarer, before that point), the game ends and the remaining categories are left unplayed, unless one of them concealed a bonus.\n\nDuring the later years of the ABC run, if either team achieved a perfect score of 21, it was worth a $1,000 bonus ($500 during the ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era), later changed to a prize near the end of the run, while the 1977\u201378 season of the Cullen version likewise offered a $2,100 bonus for a perfect score.\n\nOriginally, if a tie occurred after the rounds were completed, the host gave the team who caused the tie a choice between two letters of the alphabet, and the team then played a round with seven words each beginning with that letter. The opposing team was then given seven words with the other letter. Tiebreaker rounds were played until the tie was broken, though the rules were later changed to award the victory to whichever team completed its own seven words faster, if both teams did so. In the 2016 Strahan version, if both teams achieve the same score, the team to do so in the shorter time is declared the winner, with a tiebreaker round being played if the teams match each other for both score and time.\n\nBeginning in January 1984, if both teams managed a \"perfect game\" by each scoring 21 points, the contestant whose team won the tiebreaker originally received a new car, but this was changed to a $5,000 cash bonus by September of that year. This bonus was also used on the 1980s incarnation of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''.\n\n====Bonus Cards====\nThroughout the 1970s, a random category during the main game doubled as the \"Big 7\", meaning that the contestant originally received a prize if all seven words were guessed correctly, but this was soon changed to a $500 cash bonus. On the Bill Cullen-hosted ''$25,000 Pyramid'', the Big 7 payoff was $1,000 when it was first introduced during the second season, but this was later replaced by a \"Big Money Card\" worth varying amounts of cash from $1,000 to $5,000 (though the maximum amount was later dropped to $4,000); for the final season, the Big 7 returned, and was always played for a [[Chevrolet Chevette]].\n\nDuring the short-lived ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, there was no official bonus card; rather, each of the two teams selected one category from either of the day's two games to designate as their \"Bonus 7\", which otherwise worked the same as the Big 7, right down to the $500 bonus. However, unlike any other version, all bonuses won in this manner counted towards a team's score for the day.\n\nThe short-lived ''$50,000 Pyramid'' used no bonus cards, but added a feature called \"The Player of the Week\", in which the contestant who successfully conveyed or identified all seven answers in the fastest time during a main game round that week received a trip for two to [[Europe]], and later returned to compete in the show's $50,000 tournament. If two players were tied during a particular show or week, the tied players would return at the beginning or end of an episode and play a standard tiebreaker round to determine a winner.\n\nSimilar to the earlier Big 7, a new bonus called the \"7\u201311\" was introduced in April 1983 for the CBS version, hidden behind one category in the first round; if all seven words were guessed, the contestant won an $1,100 bonus. Initially, the contestant could choose to play for either this bonus or $50 per correct guess, but this option was dropped from January 1985 onward in favor of the all-or-nothing approach.\n\nBeginning in 1982, a random category in the second round was designated as the \"Mystery 7\", in which the host did not reveal the topic of the category until after the fact, and correctly guessing all seven words awarded a prize. The Mystery 7 was initially shown to the teams as one of the six categories, but from April 1984 onward, it was hidden behind a category name. This is the only bonus used in the 2016 edition, during the second round of each half.\n\nFor a brief time in early 1983, the Mystery 7 was replaced by a format similar to the earlier \"Player of the Week\" feature from ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', in which the player who had the fastest main game round during the week would win a Greek cruise. However, this bonus was dropped after only three weeks, and the Mystery 7 reinstated.\n\nThe John Davidson-hosted version had its own similar bonuses: \"Gamble for a Grand\"/\"Gamble for a Trip\" offered the choice to reduce the round's time limit from 30 to 25 seconds to win $1,000 cash or a trip, respectively, and \"Double Trouble\" offered the team 45 seconds to guess seven two-word responses for a $500 bonus. \n\nThe Donny Osmond-hosted version had only one bonus: \"Super Six\", which was featured in both games each day, and awarded the contestant a prize if the team managed to get all six words within the 20 seconds.\n\nOn the GSN version, there were no bonus cards, but sweeping a category awarded a $500 bonus and added $5,000 to the Winner's Circle bank (see below).\n\n===Winners' Circle===\n[[Image:Kathy Najimy on The $100,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contestant, restrained in her seat, gives clues to [[Kathy Najimy]] in the Winners' Circle on ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 2016.]]\nThe winning team from the main game plays \"The Winners' Circle,\" in which the goal is to communicate six categories of increasing difficulty within 60 seconds, using only lists of words and phrases that fit them. During the show's original run on CBS from 1973 to 1974, hand gestures of any kind were permitted in this round. However, when the show moved to ABC in 1974, hand gestures became strictly forbidden, and all subsequent editions of the show included wrist straps attached to the chair to help contestants abide by this rule.  One team member gives clues to the category currently in play, while the other tries to guess it. An illegal clue (descriptions, saying a form of the answer, or a direct synonym) or hand gesture results in the category being thrown out, thus disqualifying the contestant from winning the grand prize; however, the contestant is still allowed to play the remainder of the Winners' Circle, either until time runs out or until the remaining categories have been correctly guessed. If all six categories are guessed before time runs out, the contestant wins the top prize; if not, he/she wins money for the guessed categories.{{sfn|Graham|1988|pages=181\u2013182}}{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013222}}{{sfn|Fabe|1979|pages=255\u2013259}} The clue-giver can pass on a category and then return to it after playing through all six, if time allows.\n\nThe values for individual categories during standard gameplay are shown in the table below. Category numbering proceeds across the bottom row of the pyramid (left/center/right), then the middle (left/right), and finally the single one at the peak.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"8\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Version\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''1st'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" |''' 2nd'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''3rd'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''4th'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''5th'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''6th'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $10,000/$20,000/$50,000/Junior Pyramid''\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $50\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' (1970s)\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''All-Star Junior Pyramid'' Special\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' (1979)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $125\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $150\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $175\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The (New) $25,000/$100,000 Pyramid'' (1982\u20131991)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $50\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $150\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | ''Pyramid'' (2002\u201304)\n| Regular gameplay\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n|-\n| Six-player tournament/four-player semifinals\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,500\n|-\n| Finals match of a four-player tournament\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $5,000\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The Pyramid'' (2012)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $400\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $750\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' (2016)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $3,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $4,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $5,000\n|-\n|}\n\n===Returning champions and winnings limits===\nOn the 1970s daytime version, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until they were defeated or won the Winners' Circle. Under the $10,000 format, a contestant who won the Winners' Circle was allowed to keep all earlier winnings. Under the $20,000 format, the contestant's total was merely augmented to the amount won in the Winners' Circle. The syndicated versions featured no returning champions prior to 1985.\n\nAfter the top prize on the 1970s daytime show was increased to $20,000, the Winners' Circle structure likewise changed, with a champion playing for $10,000 on their first attempt, $15,000 on their second attempt, and $20,000 for their third and all subsequent efforts. During the brief ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, a team's first visit to the Winners' Circle was worth $2,500, while the second was worth $5,000.\n\nDuring the 1970s syndicated version, if a contestant won a bonus prize, then went on to win the $25,000 top prize, the value of the bonus (either the additional bonus cash, or the value of the car offered during the final season) was deducted from the champion's total, leaving them with exactly $25,000. This version did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn the short-lived 1981 version, the first Winners' Circle was worth $5,000; if the same player made it to the second Winners' Circle, it was played for a total of $10,000. This version also did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn all versions from 1982 onward, all main game bonus winnings remained intact in the event of a $25,000 win. On the $25,000 and $100,000 versions of the show, the same two contestants competed for both halves of the episode. A contestant who won the first of the two games on the episode played the Winners' Circle for $10,000. A contestant who won both games played the second Winners' Circle for a total of $25,000 (e.g., if a contestant won $10,000 in the first Winners' Circle, the second was worth an additional $15,000 to the contestant). On all versions from 1982 to 1991, a contestant who won both games of an episode became the champion and returned on the next show. If each contestant won one game, the contestant who won the higher amount in the Winners' Circle became champion (winnings from the various main game bonuses were not considered as part of the \"score\" winnings). If both contestants won equal amounts of money in the Winners' Circle (including $10,000 wins), both returned on the next show.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until defeated or a maximum of five episodes. Champions on the CBS version also retired after exceeding the network's winnings limit. This was originally $25,000, but was increased to $50,000 on October 22, 1984 (episode #0542) and to $75,000 on September 29, 1986 (episode #1041). Contestants were allowed to keep a maximum of $25,000 in excess of the limit.\n\nOn ''Pyramid'', the goal was once again to try to win $25,000. However, this required a contestant to get to and win the Winners' Circle twice. If the contestant made a second trip without having won the first, he/she was given another chance at $10,000. If the contestant managed to win both, he/she won the $25,000 and automatically qualified for the $100,000 tournament.\n\nOn ''The Pyramid'', each Winners' Circle was played for a base of $10,000. For each category that the contestant and celebrity swept in the front game, a $500 bonus was awarded to the contestant and an additional $5,000 was added to the potential prize, with the maximum prize for a trip to the Winners' Circle being $25,000 for each contestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2012/07/exclusive-info-gsn-pyramid/ |title=BUZZERBLOG Exclusive Info on 2012 GSN Revival |website=Buzzerblog.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Both ''Pyramid'' and ''The Pyramid'' did not have returning champions.\n\nThe 2016 ABC format consists of hour-long episodes, each containing two complete pairs of games. The contestant who wins the first game of a pair plays the Winners' Circle for a prize of $50,000. If the same contestant wins both games, he/she plays the second Winners' Circle for an additional $100,000, leading to a potential maximum total of $150,000.<ref>{{Cite episode|series=The $100,000 Pyramid|date=10 July 2016|network=ABC|number=3|time=42:29}}</ref> Two new contestants compete in each half of an episode; there are no returning champions.\n\n===Tournaments===\nOn ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', tournaments started with eight past \"Players of the Week\" competing over the course of a week. The quarterfinals were played on Monday and Tuesday, with two different contestants in each half, and the winner of each game would advance to the semi-finals after playing the Pyramid for $5,000. On Wednesday and Thursday, each match would have two semi-finalists playing two games against each other, with players winning one game playing for $5,000, and players winning both games in the same show playing for a total of $10,000 (as it was during regular play). The two players who won the most money would compete in the finals, while the losing contestants from the semi-finals competed in a \"wild card\" match on Friday to determine who would join them. Starting the following Monday, two finalists played one game, and the winner played the Winners' Circle for $50,000. If the grand prize was not won, that player played the next game against the finalist who sat out the previous game, continuing in this manner throughout the week until someone won in the Winners' Circle. When playing for $50,000, an illegal clue immediately ended the round, and no money was awarded for each individual category.\n\nOn the 1985\u201391 version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', the three contestants who completed the Winners' Circle in the shortest lengths of time qualified for a $100,000 tournament, which was held every few weeks. During the tournament, all front game bonuses were removed except the $5,000 bonus for breaking a 21\u201321 tie. The first contestant to complete the Winners' Circle won the $100,000 grand prize, ending the tournament. If neither contestant did so on a particular episode, the one who accumulated more money in the Winners' Circle returned on the next show to compete against the contestant who had not played on that episode (in the event of a tie, a [[coin toss]] determined who returned). If one of the three contestants won the $100,000 in the first Winners' Circle of an episode, the other two played against each other in the second half and that winner played for $10,000 in the Winners' Circle.\n\nOn the Osmond version, tournaments lasted for exactly three episodes, and rules varied depending on whether four or six champions had qualified. During a six-player tournament, each contestant's first attempt at the Winners' Circle was worth $25,000. If $25,000 was won in the first half and the same player returned to the Winners' Circle, that contestant played for an additional $75,000 and the tournament title. If the tournament ended with no players having won both Winners' Circles in one show, either the contestant who won $25,000 in the fastest time or the player who won the most money would have his or her tournament winnings augmented to $100,000. In a four-player tournament, the first two semi-finalists competed on day one and the other two semi-finalists on day two, with each Winners' Circle attempt worth $25,000.

However, due to concerns about players easily memorizing possible Winners' Circle subjects, the format of the board game's Winners' Circle endgame was changed to mirror that of the TV version's main game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2015/06/08/why-did-the-board-game-version-of-the-25000-pyramid-not-actually-have-a-pyramid-in-it/|title=Why Did the Board Game Version of the $25,000 Pyramid Not Actually Have a Pyramid In It?|date=8 June 2015|website=Legendsrevealed.com|accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Games released a new home version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1986,<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Board-Game-1986-Clark/dp/B001TKV6WG] {{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref> this time using the actual Winners' Circle rules and format, which was also given to all contestants who appeared on both the daytime and nighttime versions for most of 1987.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]]. The Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.<ref name=\"ShuttleByNumbers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon |publisher=Space.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |author=Malik, Tarik}}</ref>\n\nShuttle components include the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne [[RS-25]] main engines, a pair of recoverable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] (SRBs), and the expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] (ET) containing [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{efn|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test,<ref name=sfgapovr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=361VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6429%2C2842712 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Shuttle's first glide a 'pushover' |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1A}}</ref> where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December&nbsp;29<!--, 1980-->.<ref name=shbgsl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=965hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6796%2C9180680 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle begins slow journey to launching pad |date=December 29, 1980 |page=2A}}</ref> The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III-24}} On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]].

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.

The Spacelab equipment was primarily stored in pallets, which provided storage for both experiments as well as computer and power equipment.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|434\u2013435}} Spacelab hardware was flown on 28 missions through 1999, and studied subjects including astronomy, microgravity, radar, and life sciences.Spacelab hardware also supported missions such as Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and space station resupply. The Spacelab module was tested STS-2 and STS-3, and the first full mission was on [[STS-9]].<ref name=NASA28>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/msad15mar99_1/ |title=Spacelab joined diverse scientists and disciplines on 28 Shuttle missions|last=Dooling|first=Dave |publisher=NASA |date=March 15, 1999 |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====RS-25 engines====\n{{main|RS-25}}\n[[File:STS-133 Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver 3.jpg|thumb|[[RS-25]] engines with the two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) pods]]\n\nThree RS-25 engines, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen, and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013177\u2013183}}\n\nThe RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods. The AJ10 engines used [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) oxidized by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pods carried a maximum of {{convert|4718|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of MMH and {{convert|7773|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced {{convert|6087|lbf|N|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of thrust, and the entire system could provide {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}} of velocity change.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u201380}}\n\n====Thermal protection system====\n{{main|Space Shuttle thermal protection system}}\n\nThe orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soaking]] protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].  Beginning with [[STS-114]], the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013112\u2013113}} The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with high-temperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in a white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which provided protection for temperatures below {{convert|1200|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface insulation, as the temperature there remained below {{convert|700|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|395}}\n\n===External tank===\n{{main|Space Shuttle external tank}}\n[[File:STS-29 External Tanker Separation.jpg|thumb|The external tank after separation on [[STS-29]]]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle external tank carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The external tank was {{convert|153.8|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall and {{convert|27.6|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogren (LH<sub>2</sub>). The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity..<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421}} A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The LWT's weight was reduced by removing components from the LH<sub>2</sub> tank and reducing the thickness of some skin panels.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}} In 1998, a super light-weight external tank (SLWT) first flew on [[STS-91]]. The SLWT used the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy, which was 40% stronger and 10% less dense than its predecessor, 2219 aluminum-lithium alloy. The SLWT weighed {{convert|7500|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} less than the LWT, which allowed the Space Shuttle to deliver heavy elements to ISS's high inclination orbit.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|423-424}}\n\n===Solid Rocket Boosters===\n{{main|Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster}}\n[[File:Two Space Shuttle SRBs on the Crawler transporter.jpg|thumb|right|Two SRBs on the mobile launcher platform prior to mating with the Shuttle]]\n[[File:Freedom Star SRB recovery.jpg|thumb|left|MV Freedom Star towing a spent SRB to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.]]\nThe Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) provided 71.4% of the Space Shuttle's thrust during liftoff and ascent.

The SRB's subcomponents were the solid-propellant motor, nose cone, and rocket nozzle.  The solid-propellant motor comprised the majority of the SRB's structure, and consisted of 11 steel sections. The nose cone housed the forward separation motors and the parachute systems that were used during recovery.  The rocket nozzles could gimbal up to 8\u00b0 to allow for in-flight adjustments.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425\u2013429}}\n\nThe rocket motors were each filled with a total {{convert|1106640|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} of solid rocket propellant, and joined together at the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) at the KSC.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425\u2013426}} In addition to providing thrust during the first stage of launch, the SRBs provided structural support for the orbiter vehicle and ET, as they were the only system that was connected to the [[mobile launcher platform]] (MLP).<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|427}}  At the time of launch, the SRBs were armed at T-5 minutes, and could only be electrically ignited once the RS-25 engines had ignited and were without issue.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|428}} They each provided {{convert|2800000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=3}} of thrust, which was later improved to {{convert|3000000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=3}} beginning on [[STS-8]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425}} After expending their fuel, the SRBs were jettisoned approximately two minutes after launch at an altitude of approximately {{convert|150000|ft|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The rocket motor, igniter, and nozzle were then shipped to Thiokol to be refurbished and reused on subsequent flights.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|124}}\n\nThe SRBs underwent several redesigns throughout the program's lifetime.  [[STS-6]] and [[STS-7]] used SRBs that were {{convert|5000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} lighter than the standard-weight cases due to walls that were {{convert|.004|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} thinner, but were determined to be too thin. Subsequent flights until [[STS-26]] used cases that were {{convert|.003|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} thinner than the standard-weight cases, which saved {{convert|4000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}}.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.

In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{efn|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test,<ref name=sfgapovr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=361VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6429%2C2842712 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Shuttle's first glide a 'pushover' |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1A}}</ref> where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December&nbsp;29<!--, 1980-->.<ref name=shbgsl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=965hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6796%2C9180680 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle begins slow journey to launching pad |date=December 29, 1980 |page=2A}}</ref> The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III-24}} On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]].

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry.

It could be used to grasp and manipulate payloads, as well as serve as a mobile platform for astronauts conducting an EVA. The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.  The Spacelab module contained two {{convert|9|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight. Astronauts entered the Spacelab module through a {{convert|8.72|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} or {{convert|18.88|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tunnel that connected to the airlock.  The Spacelab equipment was primarily stored in pallets, which provided storage for both experiments as well as computer and power equipment.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|434\u2013435}} Spacelab hardware was flown on 28 missions through 1999, and studied subjects including astronomy, microgravity, radar, and life sciences.Spacelab hardware also supported missions such as Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and space station resupply. The Spacelab module was tested STS-2 and STS-3, and the first full mission was on [[STS-9]].<ref name=NASA28>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/msad15mar99_1/ |title=Spacelab joined diverse scientists and disciplines on 28 Shuttle missions|last=Dooling|first=Dave |publisher=NASA |date=March 15, 1999 |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====RS-25 engines====\n{{main|RS-25}}\n[[File:STS-133 Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver 3.jpg|thumb|[[RS-25]] engines with the two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) pods]]\n\nThree RS-25 engines, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen, and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013177\u2013183}}\n\nThe RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods. The AJ10 engines used [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) oxidized by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pods carried a maximum of {{convert|4718|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of MMH and {{convert|7773|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced {{convert|6087|lbf|N|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of thrust, and the entire system could provide {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}} of velocity change.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u201380}}\n\n====Thermal protection system====\n{{main|Space Shuttle thermal protection system}}\n\nThe orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soaking]] protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].  Beginning with [[STS-114]], the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013112\u2013113}} The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with high-temperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in a white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which provided protection for temperatures below {{convert|1200|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface insulation, as the temperature there remained below {{convert|700|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|395}}\n\n===External tank===\n{{main|Space Shuttle external tank}}\n[[File:STS-29 External Tanker Separation.jpg|thumb|The external tank after separation on [[STS-29]]]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle external tank carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The external tank was {{convert|153.8|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall and {{convert|27.6|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogren (LH<sub>2</sub>). The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity..<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421}} A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The LWT's weight was reduced by removing components from the LH<sub>2</sub> tank and reducing the thickness of some skin panels.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}} In 1998, a super light-weight external tank (SLWT) first flew on [[STS-91]]. The SLWT used the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy, which was 40% stronger and 10% less dense than its predecessor, 2219 aluminum-lithium alloy. The SLWT weighed {{convert|7500|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} less than the LWT, which allowed the Space Shuttle to deliver heavy elements to ISS's high inclination orbit.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|423-424}}\n\n===Solid Rocket Boosters===\n{{main|Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster}}\n[[File:Two Space Shuttle SRBs on the Crawler transporter.jpg|thumb|right|Two SRBs on the mobile launcher platform prior to mating with the Shuttle]]\n[[File:Freedom Star SRB recovery.jpg|thumb|left|MV Freedom Star towing a spent SRB to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.]]\nThe Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) provided 71.4% of the Space Shuttle's thrust during liftoff and ascent.

The SRB's subcomponents were the solid-propellant motor, nose cone, and rocket nozzle.  The solid-propellant motor comprised the majority of the SRB's structure, and consisted of 11 steel sections. The nose cone housed the forward separation motors and the parachute systems that were used during recovery.  The rocket nozzles could gimbal up to 8\u00b0 to allow for in-flight adjustments.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425\u2013429}}\n\nThe rocket motors were each filled with a total {{convert|1106640|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} of solid rocket propellant, and joined together at the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) at the KSC.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425\u2013426}} In addition to providing thrust during the first stage of launch, the SRBs provided structural support for the orbiter vehicle and ET, as they were the only system that was connected to the [[mobile launcher platform]] (MLP).<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|427}}  At the time of launch, the SRBs were armed at T-5 minutes, and could only be electrically ignited once the RS-25 engines had ignited and were without issue.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|428}} They each provided {{convert|2800000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=3}} of thrust, which was later improved to {{convert|3000000|lbf|kN|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=3}} beginning on [[STS-8]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425}} After expending their fuel, the SRBs were jettisoned approximately two minutes after launch at an altitude of approximately {{convert|150000|ft|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The rocket motor, igniter, and nozzle were then shipped to Thiokol to be refurbished and reused on subsequent flights.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|124}}\n\nThe SRBs underwent several redesigns throughout the program's lifetime.  [[STS-6]] and [[STS-7]] used SRBs that were {{convert|5000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} lighter than the standard-weight cases due to walls that were {{convert|.004|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} thinner, but were determined to be too thin.

By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TNT\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977).

Acquired shows started picking up again with ''[[Totally Spies!]]'' the following year.\n\n===2004\u20132010===\n[[File:Cartoon Network 2004 logo.svg|thumb|Cartoon Network's second logo was used from June 14, 2004, until May 29, 2010.

These bumpers lasted from 2004 to 2007. By now, nearly all of Cartoon Network's classic programming had been relocated to its sister network [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] to make way for new programming.\n\n2005 saw the debuts of five more original series: ''[[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', ''[[Robotboy]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', and ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]''. On August 22, Cartoon Network launched a block aimed at the preschool demographic known as ''[[Tickle-U]]''; shows on the block included ''[[Gordon the Garden Gnome]]'', ''[[Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto!]]'', ''[[Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Little Robots]]'', ''[[Firehouse Tales]]'', and ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing (TV series)|Gerald McBoing-Boing]]''. The block was largely unsuccessful and was discontinued in 2007. From 2005 to 2008, most of the network's older Cartoon Cartoons (such as ''Dexter's Laboratory'' and ''The Powerpuff Girls'') could be viewed in segments on a half-hour block known as ''The Cartoon Cartoon Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-fall-of-cartoon-network/|title=The Fall of Cartoon Network|work=themarysue.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721103116/https://www.themarysue.com/the-fall-of-cartoon-network/|archive-date=July 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Cartoon Network signed a deal with [[AMC Theatres]] for Summer MovieCamp to feature episodes of ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'', ''Camp Lazlo'', ''The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy'', ''Codename: Kids Next Door'', and ''Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends'' in the big screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://press.ncm.com/press-release/general/kids-see-movies-free-sweet-summer-deal|title=Cartoon Network Presents Summer MovieCamp at AMC Theatres|work=NCM|access-date=May 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501195752/https://press.ncm.com/press-release/general/kids-see-movies-free-sweet-summer-deal|archive-date=May 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter its predecessor, ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', Cartoon Network created an all-new animated short series consisting of overseas shorts, pilots, college shorts, or even shorts created for the show itself. That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''. Three made-for-TV movies debuted this year: ''[[Operation Z.E.R.O.|Codename: Kids Next Door&nbsp;\u2013 Operation Z.E.R.O.]]'', ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: Good Wilt Hunting]]'', and ''[[Re-Animated]]'', the latter of which was the network's first live-action TV movie and a collaboration between live-action and animation.\n\nSamples resigned from his post on February 9, 2007, following a [[2007 Boston Mooninite panic|bomb scare in Boston]] caused by packages left around the city that were part of an outdoor marketing campaign promoting the Adult Swim series ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare|url=https://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|date=February 1, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803005034/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|archive-date=August 3, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Jim Samples\">{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|title=Cartoon Network Boss Quits Over Bomb Scare|date=February 9, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322003040/http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|archive-date=March 22, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> On May 2, Stuart Snyder was named Samples' successor.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php| title= Stuart Snyder: The Perfect Combination| first= Allison| last= Romano| date= October 21, 2007| publisher= Broadcasting & Cable| accessdate= August 13, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100218194456/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php| archive-date= February 18, 2010| url-status= dead}}</ref> On September 1, the network's look was revamped, with bumpers and station IDs themed to [[The Hives]] song \"[[The Hives#The Hives on Cartoon Network|Fall is Just Something That Grown-Ups Invented]].\" 2007 saw the debut of ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'', a spin-off of the movie ''Re-Animated'', and the first live-action Cartoon Network series. 2007 also saw the debut of the series ''[[Chowder (TV series)|Chowder]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TNT\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977).

Acquired shows started picking up again with ''[[Totally Spies!]]'' the following year.\n\n===2004\u20132010===\n[[File:Cartoon Network 2004 logo.svg|thumb|Cartoon Network's second logo was used from June 14, 2004, until May 29, 2010.

These bumpers lasted from 2004 to 2007. By now, nearly all of Cartoon Network's classic programming had been relocated to its sister network [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] to make way for new programming.\n\n2005 saw the debuts of five more original series: ''[[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', ''[[Robotboy]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', and ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]''. On August 22, Cartoon Network launched a block aimed at the preschool demographic known as ''[[Tickle-U]]''; shows on the block included ''[[Gordon the Garden Gnome]]'', ''[[Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto!]]'', ''[[Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Little Robots]]'', ''[[Firehouse Tales]]'', and ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing (TV series)|Gerald McBoing-Boing]]''. The block was largely unsuccessful and was discontinued in 2007. From 2005 to 2008, most of the network's older Cartoon Cartoons (such as ''Dexter's Laboratory'' and ''The Powerpuff Girls'') could be viewed in segments on a half-hour block known as ''The Cartoon Cartoon Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-fall-of-cartoon-network/|title=The Fall of Cartoon Network|work=themarysue.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721103116/https://www.themarysue.com/the-fall-of-cartoon-network/|archive-date=July 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Cartoon Network signed a deal with [[AMC Theatres]] for Summer MovieCamp to feature episodes of ''Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi'', ''Camp Lazlo'', ''The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy'', ''Codename: Kids Next Door'', and ''Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends'' in the big screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://press.ncm.com/press-release/general/kids-see-movies-free-sweet-summer-deal|title=Cartoon Network Presents Summer MovieCamp at AMC Theatres|work=NCM|access-date=May 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501195752/https://press.ncm.com/press-release/general/kids-see-movies-free-sweet-summer-deal|archive-date=May 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter its predecessor, ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', Cartoon Network created an all-new animated short series consisting of overseas shorts, pilots, college shorts, or even shorts created for the show itself. That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''. Three made-for-TV movies debuted this year: ''[[Operation Z.E.R.O.|Codename: Kids Next Door&nbsp;\u2013 Operation Z.E.R.O.]]'', ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: Good Wilt Hunting]]'', and ''[[Re-Animated]]'', the latter of which was the network's first live-action TV movie and a collaboration between live-action and animation.\n\nSamples resigned from his post on February 9, 2007, following a [[2007 Boston Mooninite panic|bomb scare in Boston]] caused by packages left around the city that were part of an outdoor marketing campaign promoting the Adult Swim series ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare|url=https://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|date=February 1, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803005034/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|archive-date=August 3, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Jim Samples\">{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|title=Cartoon Network Boss Quits Over Bomb Scare|date=February 9, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322003040/http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|archive-date=March 22, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> On May 2, Stuart Snyder was named Samples' successor.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php| title= Stuart Snyder: The Perfect Combination| first= Allison| last= Romano| date= October 21, 2007| publisher= Broadcasting & Cable| accessdate= August 13, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100218194456/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php| archive-date= February 18, 2010| url-status= dead}}</ref> On September 1, the network's look was revamped, with bumpers and station IDs themed to [[The Hives]] song \"[[The Hives#The Hives on Cartoon Network|Fall is Just Something That Grown-Ups Invented]].\" 2007 saw the debut of ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'', a spin-off of the movie ''Re-Animated'', and the first live-action Cartoon Network series. 2007 also saw the debut of the series ''[[Chowder (TV series)|Chowder]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

The network's HD content airs with letterboxing on the standard definition channel, and since May 13, 2013, the high definition feed is downscaled by the provider for the standard definition feed, resulting in all programming appearing in a 16:9 ratio with letterboxing.

Tacitus is considered to be one of the greatest Roman historians.<ref name=\"Voorst39\">{{cite book|title=Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence|author=Van Voorst, Robert E|date=2000|publisher=Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4368-5|pages=39\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|author=Ferguson, Everett|date=2003|isbn=978-0-8028-2221-5|page=116}}</ref> He lived in what has been called the [[Silver Age of Latin literature]], and is known for the brevity and compactness of his [[Latin language|Latin]] prose, as well as for his penetrating insights into the psychology of power politics.\n\nThe surviving portions of his two major works\u2014the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]''\u2014examine the reigns of the [[Roman emperor|emperors]] [[Tiberius]], [[Claudius]], [[Nero]], and those who reigned in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69 AD). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.\n\nTacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').\n\n==Life==\nDetails about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].<ref>''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hell\u00e9nique'', 1890, pp. 621\u2013623</ref>\n\nTacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;<ref>Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy</ref> but the exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.<ref>See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.</ref> One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.<ref>Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichit\u00e0'', 2 (1972) 169\u2013185</ref>\n\n===Family and early life===\nMost of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 612\u2013613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nHis father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|NH]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother\u2014if Cornelius was indeed his father.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26</ref> The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.</ref> His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 614\u2013616</ref> No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 616\u2013619</ref> Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145</ref>\n\nHis ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]]. This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.<ref>Gordon, 1936, pp. 150\u2013151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621\u2013624</ref>\n\n===Public life, marriage, and literary career===\nAs a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]<ref>The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> ({{circa|35 AD}} \u2013 {{circa| 100}}).<!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---> In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.<ref>''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]</ref> Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.<ref>Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny1.html#6 1.6], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#10 9.10]; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541\u2013542</ref> He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26\u201327</ref> under [[Vespasian]]<ref>([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])</ref> (r. 69\u201379), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].<ref name=quaestor>He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.</ref> He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].<ref>In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88. See Syme, 1958, p. 65; Martin, 1981, p. 27; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.</ref> He gained acclaim as a lawyer and as an [[orator]]; his skill in public speaking ironically counterpoints his ''[[cognomen]]'' ''Tacitus'' (\"silent\").\n\nHe served in the provinces from {{circa| 89}} to {{circa| 93}}, either in command of a [[Roman legion|legion]] or in a civilian post.<ref>The ''Agricola'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+45 45.5]) indicates that Tacitus and his wife were absent at the time of Julius Agricola's death in 93.

If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387\u2013393.</ref>\nIt remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (r. 275\u2013276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.<ref>''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X].

[[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus\u2014but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of persons mentioned in the works of Tacitus}}\n[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of [[Justus Lipsius]]'s 1598 edition of the complete works of Tacitus, bearing the stamps of the ''Bibliotheca Comunale'' in [[Empoli]], Italy]]\n\nFive works ascribed to Tacitus have survived (albeit with lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:\n* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')\n* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')\n* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')\n* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')\n* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')\n\n===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===\nThe ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.<ref>[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', \"in thirty volumes\".</ref>\nAlthough Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the ''Annals'' survived in a single manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany, and the second half in a single manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.\n\n====The ''Histories''====\n{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}\nIn an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains\u2014as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]\u2014a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.\n\n====The ''Annals''====\n{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].\n[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]\n\n===Monographs===\nTacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.\n\n====''Germania''====\n{{Main|Germania (book)}}\n\nThe ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1\u201327) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10\u201313).\n\n====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====\n{{Main|Agricola (book)}}\nThe ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014Oxford Revised Translation).\n\n====''Dialogus''====\n{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]\nThere is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.\n\n==Literary style==\nTacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.\n\nIn most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.\n\n===Approach to history===\nTacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating\u2014often pessimistic\u2014insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:\n:{|-\n| \"inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.\"\n| &nbsp;\n| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''\n|}\nThere has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' \"neutrality\". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance\u2014that of [[free speech]]\u2014to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.\n\nTacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])\n\n<blockquote>Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.</blockquote>\n\nTacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81\u201396) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.\n\nNonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.\n\nIn general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).\n\n===Prose===\nHis Latin style is highly praised.<ref>Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: \"No other writer of Latin prose\u2014not even Cicero\u2014deploys so effectively the full resources of the language.\"</ref> His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic\u2014the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as \"harsh, unpleasant, and thorny\" and praised as \"grave, concise, and pithily eloquent\".\n\nA passage of [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|''Annals'' 1.1]], where Tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the last four [[Roman Emperor (Principate)#Julio-Claudian dynasty|emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty]], illustrates his style: \"The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred\",<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_1&oldid=3754977#1 The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1] Translation based on Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb (1876).

But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending \"\u2026-entibus \u2026-is\" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions\u2014which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.<ref>Ostler 2007, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: \"\u2026some writers\u2014notably the perverse genius Tacitus\u2014delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.\" \u2013 \"this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms\u2026only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.\"</ref>\n\nHis historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight\u2014though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.<ref>John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff</ref> He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any \"treasonous\" speech or writings\u2014and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64\u201366) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.\n\nTacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.\n\n==Sources==\nTacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.\n\nTacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34\u201335.\n\n==Editions==\n* Damon, Cynthia (2003) ''Tacitus: Histories Book I.'' Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.

These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of [[Augustus]], in 14 AD, to the years of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], in 70 AD. There are substantial [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in the surviving texts, including a gap in the ''Annals'' that is four books long.\n\nTacitus' other writings discuss [[Public speaking|oratory]] (in [[dialogue]] format, see ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''), [[Germania]] (in ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]''), and the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], the general responsible for much of the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] of [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britain]], mainly focusing on his campaign in [[Britannia]] (''[[De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae]]'').\n\n==Life==\nDetails about his personal life are scarce. What little is known comes from scattered hints throughout his work, the letters of his friend and admirer [[Pliny the Younger]], and an inscription found at [[Mylasa]] in [[Caria]].<ref>''[[Orientis Graeci Inscriptionis Selectae|OGIS]]'' 487, first brought to light in ''Bulletin de correspondance hell\u00e9nique'', 1890, pp. 621\u2013623</ref>\n\nTacitus was born in 56 or 57 to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family;<ref>Since he was appointed to the quaestorship during Titus's short rule (see [[#note-quaestor|note]] below) and twenty-five was the minimum age for the position, the date of his birth can be fixed with some accuracy</ref> but the exact place and date of his birth are not known, and his [[praenomen]] (first name) is also unknown; in the letters of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] his name is ''Gaius'', but in the major surviving manuscript of his work his name is given as ''Publius''.<ref>See Oliver, 1951, for an analysis of the manuscript from which the name Publius is taken; see also Oliver, 1977, which examines the evidence for each suggested praenomen (the well-known ''Gaius'' and ''Publius'', the lesser-known suggestions of ''Sextus'' and ''Quintus'') before settling on ''Publius'' as the most likely.</ref> One scholar's suggestion of ''Sextus'' has gained no approval.<ref>Oliver, 1977, cites an article by [[Harold Mattingly]] in ''Rivista storica dell'Antichit\u00e0'', 2 (1972) 169\u2013185</ref>\n\n===Family and early life===\nMost of the older [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families failed to survive the [[proscription]]s which took place at the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and Tacitus makes it clear that he owed his rank to the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] emperors (''Hist.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]). The claim that he was descended from a [[freedman]] is derived from a speech in his writings which asserts that many senators and knights were descended from freedmen (''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.27 13.27]), but this is generally disputed.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 612\u2013613; Gordon, 1936, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nHis father may have been the Cornelius Tacitus who served as [[Promagistrate|procurator]] of [[Belgica]] and [[Germania]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions that Cornelius had a son who aged rapidly ([[Pliny's Natural History|NH]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/7*.html 7.76]), which implies an early death. There is no mention of Tacitus suffering such a condition, but it is possible that this refers to a brother\u2014if Cornelius was indeed his father.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 60, 613; Gordon, 1936, p. 149; Martin, 1981, p. 26</ref> The friendship between the younger Pliny and Tacitus leads some scholars to conclude that they were both the offspring of wealthy provincial families.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe province of his birth remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest [[Gallia Belgica]], Gallia Narbonensis or [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Michael Grant in Introduction to Tacitus, ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', p. xvii; Herbert W. Benario in Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germany'', p. 1.</ref> His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to [[Lucius Fabius Justus]] in the ''Dialogus'' may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 614\u2013616</ref> No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint that the two men had a common background.<ref>Syme, 1958, pp. 616\u2013619</ref> Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he was asked if he was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so was asked if he was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 619; Gordon, 1936, p. 145</ref>\n\nHis ancestry, his skill in oratory, and his sympathetic depiction of barbarians who resisted Roman rule (e.g., ''Ann.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.9 2.9]) have led some to suggest that he was a [[Celts|Celt]]. This belief stems from the fact that the Celts who had occupied Gaul prior to the Roman invasion were famous for their skill in oratory, and had been subjugated by Rome.<ref>Gordon, 1936, pp. 150\u2013151; Syme, 1958, pp. 621\u2013624</ref>\n\n===Public life, marriage, and literary career===\nAs a young man, Tacitus studied [[rhetoric]] in Rome to prepare for a career in [[law]] and [[politics]]; like Pliny, he may have studied under [[Quintilian]]<ref>The fact that he studied rhetoric and law is known from the ''Dialogus'', ch. 2; see also Martin, 1981, p. 26; Syme, 1958, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> ({{circa|35 AD}} \u2013 {{circa| 100}}).<!---The precedent is established in 1st paragraph, so BC/AD should be retained throughout---> In 77 or 78, he married [[Julia Agricola]], daughter of the famous general Agricola.<ref>''Agricola'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ag.+9 9]</ref> Little is known of their domestic life, save that Tacitus loved [[hunting]] and the outdoors.<ref>Pliny, ''Letters'' [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny1.html#6 1.6], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#10 9.10]; Benario, 1975, pp. 15, 17; Syme, 1958, pp. 541\u2013542</ref> He started his career (probably the ''[[latus clavus]]'', mark of the senator)<ref>Syme, 1958, p. 63; Martin, 1981, pp. 26\u201327</ref> under [[Vespasian]]<ref>([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1])</ref> (r. 69\u201379), but entered political life as a [[quaestor]] in 81 or 82 under [[Titus]].<ref name=quaestor>He states his debt to Titus in his ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]); since Titus ruled only briefly, these are the only years possible.</ref> He advanced steadily through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', becoming [[praetor]] in 88 and a [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]], a member of the priestly college in charge of the [[Sibylline Books]] and the [[Secular games]].<ref>In the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+11.11 11.11]), he mentions that, as praetor, he assisted in the Secular Games held by Domitian, which can be precisely dated to 88.

See Dudley, 1968, p. 16</ref> Afterwards, he absented himself from public life, but returned during [[Trajan]]'s reign (98\u2013117).

A passage in the ''Annals'' fixes 116 as the ''[[terminus post quem]]'' of his death, which may have been as late as 125 or even 130. It seems that he survived both Pliny (died {{circa|113}}) and Trajan (died 117).<ref>Grant in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Annals'', p. xvii; Benario in his Introduction to Tacitus, ''Germania'', p. 2. ''Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+2.61 2.61], says that the Roman Empire \"now extends to the [[Red Sea]]\". If by ''mare rubrum'' he means the [[Persian Gulf]], the passage must have been written after Trajan's eastern conquests in 116, but before [[Hadrian]] abandoned the new territories in 117. But this may only indicate the date of publication for the first books of the ''Annals''; Tacitus could have lived well into Hadrian's reign, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not. See Dudley, 1968, p. 17; Mellor, 1993, p. 9; Mendell, 1957, p. 7; Syme, 1958, p. 473; against this traditional interpretation, e.g., Goodyear, 1981, pp. 387\u2013393.</ref>\nIt remains unknown whether Tacitus had any children. The ''[[Augustan History]]'' reports that Emperor [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] (r. 275\u2013276) claimed him for an ancestor and provided for the preservation of his works, but this story may be fraudulent, like much of the ''Augustan History''.<ref>''Augustan History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tacitus*.html ''Tacitus'' X]. Scholarly opinion on this story is that it is either \"a confused and worthless rumor\" (Mendell, 1957, p. 4) or \"pure fiction\" (Syme, 1958, p. 796). [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] reports (''Letters'', 4.14; cited in Syme, 1958, p. 796) that [[Polemius]], a 5th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, is descended from Tacitus\u2014but this claim, says Syme (ibid.), is of little value.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of persons mentioned in the works of Tacitus}}\n[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of [[Justus Lipsius]]'s 1598 edition of the complete works of Tacitus, bearing the stamps of the ''Bibliotheca Comunale'' in [[Empoli]], Italy]]\n\nFive works ascribed to Tacitus have survived (albeit with lacunae), the most substantial of which are the ''Annals'' and the ''Histories''. This canon (with approximate dates) consists of:\n* (98) ''[[Agricola (book)|De vita Iulii Agricolae]]'' (''The Life of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]]'')\n* (98) ''[[Germania (book)|De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' (''Germania'')\n* (102) ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' (''Dialogue on Oratory'')\n* (105) ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'' (''Histories'')\n* (117) ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ab excessu divi Augusti]]'' (''Annals'')\n\n===History of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus===\nThe ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and the ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', published separately, were meant to form a single edition of thirty books.<ref>[[Jerome]]'s commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]] (14.1, 2; quoted in Mendell, 1957, p. 228) says that Tacitus's history was extant ''triginta voluminibus'', \"in thirty volumes\".</ref>\nAlthough Tacitus wrote the ''Histories'' before the ''Annals'', the events in the ''Annals'' precede the ''Histories''; together they form a continuous narrative from the death of [[Augustus]] (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the ''Annals'' survived in a single manuscript from [[Corvey Abbey]] in Germany, and the second half in a single manuscript from [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.\n\n====The ''Histories''====\n{{Main|Histories (Tacitus)}}\nIn an early chapter of the ''Agricola'', Tacitus asserts that he wishes to speak about the years of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In the ''Histories'' the scope has changed; Tacitus says that he will deal with the age of Nerva and Trajan at a later time. Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] and end with the despotism of the [[Flavian Dynasty|Flavians]]. Only the first four books and twenty-six chapters of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book contains\u2014as a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]\u2014a short [[ethnography|ethnographic]] survey of the ancient [[Jew]]s, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.\n\n====The ''Annals''====\n{{Main|Annals (Tacitus)}}\nThe ''Annals'', Tacitus' final work, covers the period from the death of [[Augustus Caesar]] in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of [[Tiberius]] and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]]. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the ''Histories''. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the [[Roman Empire]], with which he had planned to finish his work. The ''Annals'' is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention [[Christ]], which Tacitus does in connection with [[Nero#First persecutor|Nero's persecution of the Christians]].\n[[File:MII.png|thumb|''Annals'' 15.44, in the second Medicean manuscript]]\n\n===Monographs===\nTacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. ''Agricola'', a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the ''Germania'', a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the ''Dialogus'', a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.\n\n====''Germania''====\n{{Main|Germania (book)}}\n\nThe ''Germania'' ([[Latin]] title: ''De Origine et situ Germanorum'') is an ethnographic work on the [[Germanic tribe]]s outside the Roman Empire. The ''Germania'' fits within a classical ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Julius Caesar]]. The book begins (chapters 1\u201327) with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], such as the [[Fenni]]. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his ''Agricola'' (chapters 10\u201313).\n\n====''Agricola'' (''De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae'')====\n{{Main|Agricola (book)}}\nThe ''Agricola'' (written {{circa|98}}) recounts the life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola, an eminent Roman general and Tacitus' father-in-law; it also covers, briefly, the geography and ethnography of ancient [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. As in the ''Germania'', Tacitus favorably contrasts the liberty of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] with the tyranny and corruption of the Empire; the book also contains eloquent polemics against the greed of Rome, one of which, that Tacitus claims is from a speech by [[Calgacus]], ends by asserting that ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. \u2014Oxford Revised Translation).\n\n====''Dialogus''====\n{{Main|Dialogus de oratoribus}}\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The style of the ''Dialogus'' follows Cicero's models for Latin rhetoric.]]\nThere is uncertainty about when Tacitus wrote ''Dialogus de oratoribus''. Many characteristics set it apart from the other works of Tacitus, so that its authenticity has at various times been questioned. It is likely to be early work, indebted to the author's rhetorical training, since its style imitates that of the foremost Roman orator [[Cicero]]. It lacks (for example) the incongruities that are typical of his mature historical works. The ''Dialogus'' is dedicated to Fabius Iustus, a consul in 102 AD.\n\n==Literary style==\nTacitus's writings are known for their dense prose that seldom glosses the facts, in contrast to the style of some of his contemporaries, such as [[Plutarch]]. When he writes about a near-defeat of the Roman army in ''Ann.'' I, 63 he does so with brevity of description rather than embellishment.\n\nIn most of his writings he keeps to a chronological narrative order, only seldom outlining the bigger picture, leaving the readers to construct that picture for themselves. Nonetheless, where he does use broad strokes, for example, in the opening paragraphs of the ''Annals'', he uses a few condensed phrases which take the reader to the heart of the story.\n\n===Approach to history===\nTacitus's historical style owes some debt to [[Sallust]]. His historiography offers penetrating\u2014often pessimistic\u2014insights into the psychology of power politics, blending straightforward descriptions of events, moral lessons, and tightly focused dramatic accounts. Tacitus's own declaration regarding his approach to history (''Annals'' I,1) is well known:\n:{|-\n| \"inde consilium mihi ... tradere ... sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.\"\n| &nbsp;\n| ''my purpose is to relate ... without either anger or zeal, motives from which I am far removed.''\n|}\nThere has been much scholarly discussion about Tacitus' \"neutrality\". Throughout his writing, he is preoccupied with the balance of power between the Senate and the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]], and the increasing corruption of the governing [[social class|classes]] of Rome as they adjusted to the ever-growing wealth and power of the empire. In Tacitus's view, Senators squandered their cultural inheritance\u2014that of [[free speech]]\u2014to placate their (rarely benign) emperor.\n\nTacitus noted the increasing dependence of the emperor on the goodwill of his armies. The Julio-Claudians eventually gave way to generals, who followed Julius Caesar (and Sulla and Pompey) in recognizing that military might could secure them the political power in Rome.(''Hist.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.4 1.4])\n\n<blockquote>Welcome as the death of Nero had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused various emotions in Rome, among the Senators, the people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.</blockquote>\n\nTacitus's political career was largely lived out under the emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and [[decadence]] of that era (81\u201396) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. He draws our attention to the dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the [[apathy]] and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.\n\nNonetheless, the image he builds of Tiberius throughout the first six books of the ''Annals'' is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly ''positive'' in the first books, and predominantly ''negative'' after the intrigues of [[Sejanus]]. The entrance of Tiberius in the first chapters of the first book is dominated by the [[hypocrisy]] of the new emperor and his courtiers. In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.\n\nIn general, Tacitus does not fear to praise and to criticize the same person, often noting what he takes to be their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's hallmarks is refraining from ''conclusively'' taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see [[Tacitean studies]], ''Black'' vs. ''Red'' Tacitists).\n\n===Prose===\nHis Latin style is highly praised.<ref>Donald R. Dudley. Introduction to: ''The Annals of Tacitus''. NY: Mentor Book, 1966. p. xiv: \"No other writer of Latin prose\u2014not even Cicero\u2014deploys so effectively the full resources of the language.\"</ref> His style, although it has a grandeur and eloquence (thanks to Tacitus's education in rhetoric), is extremely concise, even [[epigram]]matic\u2014the sentences are rarely flowing or beautiful, but their point is always clear. The style has been both derided as \"harsh, unpleasant, and thorny\" and praised as \"grave, concise, and pithily eloquent\".\n\nA passage of [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|''Annals'' 1.1]], where Tacitus laments the state of the historiography regarding the last four [[Roman Emperor (Principate)#Julio-Claudian dynasty|emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty]], illustrates his style: \"The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred\",<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_1&oldid=3754977#1 The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1] Translation based on Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb (1876).

But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying ''and'' in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending \"\u2026-entibus \u2026-is\" are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions\u2014which one would however need to be acquainted with to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.<ref>Ostler 2007, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399 where the quoted example is used; Further quotes from the book: \"\u2026some writers\u2014notably the perverse genius Tacitus\u2014delighted in disappointing the expectations raised by periodic theory.\" \u2013 \"this monkeying with hard-won stylistic norms\u2026only makes sense if readers knew the rules that Tacitus was breaking.\"</ref>\n\nHis historical works focus on the motives of the characters, often with penetrating insight\u2014though it is questionable how much of his insight is correct, and how much is convincing only because of his rhetorical skill.<ref>John Taylor. ''Tacitus and the Boudican Revolt''. Dublin: Camvlos, 1998. p. 1 ff</ref> He is at his best when exposing hypocrisy and dissimulation; for example, he follows a narrative recounting Tiberius's refusal of the title ''pater patriae'' by recalling the institution of a law forbidding any \"treasonous\" speech or writings\u2014and the frivolous prosecutions which resulted (''Annals'', 1.72). Elsewhere (''Annals'' 4.64\u201366) he compares Tiberius's public distribution of fire relief to his failure to stop the perversions and abuses of justice which he had begun. Although this kind of insight has earned him praise, he has also been criticised for ignoring the larger context.\n\nTacitus owes most, both in language and in method, to Sallust, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the later historian whose work most closely approaches him in style.\n\n==Sources==\nTacitus makes use of the official sources of the Roman state: the ''[[acta senatus]]'' (the minutes of the sessions of the Senate) and the ''[[acta diurna populi Romani]]'' (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital). He also read collections of emperors' speeches, such as those of Tiberius and Claudius. He is generally seen{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as a scrupulous historian who paid careful attention to his sources. The minor inaccuracies in the ''Annals'' may be due to Tacitus dying before he had finished (and therefore before he had proof-read) his work.\n\nTacitus cites some of his sources directly, among them [[Cluvius Rufus]], [[Fabius Rusticus]] and Pliny the Elder, who had written ''Bella Germaniae'' and a historical work which was the continuation of that of [[Aufidius Bassus]]. Tacitus also uses collections of letters (''epistolarium''). He also took information from ''exitus illustrium virorum''. These were a collection of books by those who were antithetical to the emperors. They tell of sacrifices by martyrs to freedom, especially the men who committed suicide. While he places no value on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theory of suicide and views suicides as ostentatious and politically useless, Tacitus often gives prominence to speeches made by those about to commit suicide, for example [[Cremutius Cordus]]' speech in ''Ann.'' IV, 34\u201335.\n\n==Editions==\n* Damon, Cynthia (2003) ''Tacitus: Histories Book I.'' Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics.
