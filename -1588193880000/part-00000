Using an experimental approach to each medium, DeFeo developed her own \u201cvisual vocabulary,\u201d playing with scale, color vs. black and white, texture or the illusion of texture, and precision vs. ambiguity. She wrote, \u201cI do believe that more so than most artists, I maintain a kind of consciousness of everything I\u2019ve ever done while I\u2019m engaged on a current work.\u201d<ref>DeFeo, Jay. \"My Visual Vocabulary\" in ''Jay DeFeo: The Ripple Effect'', 139-146</ref> DeFeo often made her artwork in series\u2014exploring, for example, light and dark versions, as well as mirror opposites. At times her artwork took off from a small quotidian object, such as a dental bridge or swimming goggles, transforming the everyday into something with \u201cuniversal character.\u201d<ref>DeFeo, Jay.

She met the artist [[Wally Hedrick]] and they married in 1954.

Using an experimental approach to each medium, DeFeo developed her own \u201cvisual vocabulary,\u201d playing with scale, color vs. black and white, texture or the illusion of texture, and precision vs. ambiguity. She wrote, \u201cI do believe that more so than most artists, I maintain a kind of consciousness of everything I\u2019ve ever done while I\u2019m engaged on a current work.\u201d<ref>DeFeo, Jay. \"My Visual Vocabulary\" in ''Jay DeFeo: The Ripple Effect'', 139-146</ref> DeFeo often made her artwork in series\u2014exploring, for example, light and dark versions, as well as mirror opposites. At times her artwork took off from a small quotidian object, such as a dental bridge or swimming goggles, transforming the everyday into something with \u201cuniversal character.\u201d<ref>DeFeo, Jay.

It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor revisions were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]]. Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]]. The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]]. Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected. Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car. The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs. This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]]. Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of $12,000 upon release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume. October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into [[Early_1980s_recession_in_the_United_States#1981\u20131982|recession]] and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales. Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars. By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000. By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship having only sold 350 units in January 1982<ref>https://www.inc.com/magazine/19830401/5574.html</ref> and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars. In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company; none of the dealers responded with a sales order. By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the docks in [[Long Beach]], California. By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down. Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records. Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May. When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199). For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999). For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]] and is paneled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint. With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]].  John DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.\n\n===Engine and drivetrain===\nThe engine is a [[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]] ([[V6 PRV engine|PRV]]) {{cvt|2.85|L|cuin|0}} [[V6 engine|V6]], rated at {{convert|130|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm and [[torque]] of {{convert|153|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2750 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=32725|website=carfolio.com|title=1981 De Lorean DMC-12 specifications|language=en-us|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614071722/https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=32725|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1982/587540/de_lorean_dmc-12.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1982 De Lorean DMC-12 specs|language=en-us|access-date=June 13, 2018}}</ref> that was designed and built under special contract with the [[DeLorean Motor Company]].

In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref> In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\". ''Top Gear'' writer Richard Porter included it in his book ''Crap Cars'', calling it \"dismal\".<ref name = \"Porter\">{{cite book|last=Porter |first=Richard |title=Crap Cars |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2005 |isbn=978-1582346380 |page=}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nDMC's comparison literature noted that the DeLorean could achieve {{convert|0|\u2013|60|mph|}} in 8.8 seconds, when equipped with a manual transmission. When equipped with an automatic transmission, the DeLorean would accelerate from {{convert|0|to|60|mph|}} in 10.5 seconds as tested by ''Road & Track'' magazine. The car's top speed is {{convert|109|mph|0}} as tested by ''Road & Track'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/classic-cars/reviews/a27099/1982-delorean-dmc-12-road-test/|title=1982 DeLorean DMC-12: The Vintage Road & Track Test|date=October 21, 2015|work=Road & Track|publisher=|access-date=July 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803211950/http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/classic-cars/reviews/a27099/1982-delorean-dmc-12-road-test/|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Road and Track called the car: \".. not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category ..\".\n\n==Problems and issues==\nDeLoreans, early production models in particular, suffered from poor build quality as well as mechanical issues with the vehicle. Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them. Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators. Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the [[Toe_(automotive)|toe-in]] incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid. Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual. The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n===Pricing===\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nClosing the gull-wing door from the inside can be done by using the grab handle.  For people with shorter arms, DMC installed leather pull straps attached to the grab handle.  Beginning with late-model 1981 cars, DMC revised the location of the leather pull strap to be centrally mounted and integrated into the lower door panel.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 36}}</ref>\n\nThe side [[bolster]]ing in the DeLorean was originally separate from the main interior pieces. In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have vinyl on one side and headliner fabric on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the battery would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]] to have [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] design the DeLorean Sports Car.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor revisions were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]]. Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]]. The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]]. Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected. Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car. The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs. This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].

About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume. October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into [[Early_1980s_recession_in_the_United_States#1981\u20131982|recession]] and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales. Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars. By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000. By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship having only sold 350 units in January 1982<ref>https://www.inc.com/magazine/19830401/5574.html</ref> and in February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]]. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars. In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company; none of the dealers responded with a sales order. By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the docks in [[Long Beach]], California. By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down. Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records. Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May. When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199). For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).

In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint. With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]].  John DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.\n\n===Engine and drivetrain===\nThe engine is a [[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]] ([[V6 PRV engine|PRV]]) {{cvt|2.85|L|cuin|0}} [[V6 engine|V6]], rated at {{convert|130|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm and [[torque]] of {{convert|153|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2750 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=32725|website=carfolio.com|title=1981 De Lorean DMC-12 specifications|language=en-us|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614071722/https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=32725|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1982/587540/de_lorean_dmc-12.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1982 De Lorean DMC-12 specs|language=en-us|access-date=June 13, 2018}}</ref> that was designed and built under special contract with the [[DeLorean Motor Company]].

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or race car.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh. In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref> In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them. Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators. Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the [[Toe_(automotive)|toe-in]] incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nClosing the gull-wing door from the inside can be done by using the grab handle.  For people with shorter arms, DMC installed leather pull straps attached to the grab handle.  Beginning with late-model 1981 cars, DMC revised the location of the leather pull strap to be centrally mounted and integrated into the lower door panel.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 36}}</ref>\n\nThe side [[bolster]]ing in the DeLorean was originally separate from the main interior pieces. In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have vinyl on one side and headliner fabric on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the battery would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]] to have [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] design the DeLorean Sports Car.

These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. They all had roof-mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No [[catalytic converters]] or [[Oxygen sensor|lambda equipment]] were fitted, as British legislation did not require them. \n\nOwners who bought these cars at auction in the early 1980s encountered difficulty in registering them as new vehicles in the UK. A former DeLorean Motor Cars executive offered to modify and register the cars so that they could be used in the UK by making various revisions to the tail lights, fog lights and turn signals.\n\n===''Back to the Future''===\n{{Main|DeLorean time machine}}\n[[File:1981 Delorean DMC-12 Time Machine (43754890175).jpg|thumb|Fully restored \"Hero A\" car from the ''Back to the Future'' trilogy exhibited at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]]]]\nThe DeLorean is most notably featured as the time machine in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' film trilogy]].
