[All of the population of Upper Reka, again regardless of ethnic and religious affiliation of neighboring regions, is known by the exonym \"Shkreti.\" And this happens to be the exonym retained until today. \"Shkrete\" in Albanian speech means \"deserted\". According to descriptions of ethnological and ethno-physical features, provided by some authors (Cviji\u0107, Nedeljkovi\u0107, to some extent, Smiljani\u0107), in general the population of Upper Reka, as you can see that it was really difficult and painful to live in constant fear of attacks, robberies and murder, living in \"the wilderness\" as stated today in Upper Reka. That area was \"desolate\" in the sense of living in the most difficult in terms of robberies, known by the population from neighboring areas especially Mavrovo Pole, and the Upper Polog and Lower Reka. So using the Albanian form \"shkreto\" for \"desolate\" is precisely why the population of Mavrovo Pole employed this exonym most.

[The current situation of the Macedonian Upper Reka population regarding the use of Albanian speech in everyday mutual verbal communication is unchanged. All who live in the area, even small children, use the Albanian language, although they know Macedonian too. When I worked in this area, with me of course Macedonian was communicated, but in mutual conversations again was done in Albanian. This situation unequivocally tells us that in the past the Macedonian language was used in mutual communication in Gorna Reka, because only with continued use of a language that can it be preserved, otherwise it would be lost, as in Upper River it was not the case. In Upper Reka villages, the Macedonian population knows only spoken Albanian, but cannot read and write in Albanian. In contrast, they can read and write in Macedonian, although rarely used in everyday life and it is just young who do. Upper Reka people living in Skopje or in other cities in Macedonia or abroad, in the former Yugoslavia, although most of them know Upper Reka Albanian speech, however they rarely reveal it. It is because they have Macedonian Christian names and surnames that do not cause difficulties, though from the other side when discussing personal matters, there is a little or widespread negative attitude towards the Albanian language, which is particularly acute in recent years. Even the rest of the Macedonian population in the country is not aware about the existence of a part of the Macedonian nation who use Albanian speech daily, and knowledge of the existence of this occurrence seem unlikely.  This occurrence is not unique to Upper Reka, but the Skopski Derven, Debar, Golo Brdo etc.]\"</ref>\n\n===Observances, Customs and other folk culture===\n{{See also|Culture of Upper Reka}}\n\nIn Upper Reka, a number of secular and religious holidays are celebrated.

One of the earliest authors to write about the matter was Serbian journalist [[Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107]]. In his now discredited work regarding the Balkans,<ref name=\"Promitzer204205\">{{harvnb|Promitzer|2015|pp=204\u2013205}}.\"In 1889 the journalist Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 (1855-1936) published an allegedly scientific, but for all intents and purposes Serbian nationalist monograph on Macedonia and \u201cOld Serbia\u201d (i.e. Kosovo). Gop\u010devi\u0107\u2019s biographer nevertheless argues that the monograph is not the result of authentic experiences and that he was never in Kosovo. While his manipulations with respect the allegedly Serbian character of Macedonia have already been the topic of exhaustive research, his views on the mutual relations between the Serbian and Albanian populations of Kosovo, in particular with respect to the contested notion of so- called Arnauta\u0161\u201d (Albanians of alleged Serbian (descent), have been only addressed superficially by various authors. Whatever the final judgment might be, Gop\u010devi\u0107\u2019s monograph represents a singular attempt to combine sympathies for the cultural development of the Serbian nation with the aspirations of Austria-Hungary as a Great Power in the Balkans.\"</ref> Gop\u010devi\u0107 claimed that Upper Reka inhabitants were \u201cAlbanianized Slavs\u201d.<ref name=\"Pieroni2b\">{{harvnb|Pieroni|Rexhepi|Nedelcheva|Hajdari|2013|p=2}}. \"The upper Reka Valley in Western Macedonia represents one of the very few Albanian-speaking areas in South Eastern Europe where a very detailed ethnographic account - including important notes concerning local food and medicinal plant uses - was written in the first decade of the 20th Century. Bajazid Elmaz Doda (approx. 1888 \u2013 1933) was the personal assistant and long-term partner of one of the most famous scholars in the field of Albanian studies: the Hungarian aristocrat and palaeontologist Baron Franz Nopcsa von Fels\u00f6-Szilv\u00e1s (1877 \u2013 1933). Doda finalised a manuscript in 1914, probably written in collaboration with his mentor/partner, which was focused on the daily mountain life of his village, Shtirovica, located in the upper Reka Valley (approx. 1400 m.a.s.l.). This manuscript remained unpublished until the Albanologist Robert Elsie found it in the Austrian National Library and edited it in 2007. Doda apparently wrote this account to challenge the argument of the Serbian-Austrian historian and astronomer Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 (1855 - 1928), who described the Albanians of the upper Reka Valley as \u201calbanicised Slavs\u201d.

When the informant Metodija Josifovski from Krakornica village was serving in the military in Montenegro, during a visit to a restaurant in the city had the opportunity to attend a talk that ran between several Montenegrins according to him, he spoke in Albanian, the same Albanian speech of Upper Reka inhabitants. Our informant learned that those people are Orthodox Montenegrins from two villages in Montenegro, Dajbabe and Parmiri (Personal field research).

This may confirm the findings of both our linguistic analysis on the folk plant names carried out in Table 1 and also Franz Nopcsa\u2019s ethnolinguistic analysis of the terms referring to the material culture in upper Reka, which showed very important loans from the Romanian and especially Slavic languages. It can thus be postulated that the upper Reka Albanians had been heavily influenced by the Slavic culture - and not vice versa, as Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 stated. Study participants confirmed that over recent decades their most important markets and \u201cexchange\u201d centres have been the multi-ethnic (Macedonian, Albanian, and Turk) towns of Gostivar in Western Macedonia and Prizren, in Southern Kosovo. Moreover, it must also be noted that over the span of the last century, the Albanians of the upper Reka lived outside of the borders of the Albanian state (founded in 1912), and for the major part of this period within the former Socialist Republic of Macedonia within Yugoslavia, where the dominant culture and languages have been Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian. In other words, the remarkable \u201c interference\u201d of the Slavic cultures found within the domain of Albanian traditional plant knowledge of the upper Reka represents a unique phenomenon, which nowadays is not easy to trace back in detail. This could be due to the difficulty faced in establishing to which degree the Slavic culture influenced the traditional knowledge among Albanians in the upper Reka, considering the role that ancient \u201chybridisations\u201d may have played, as both Gop\u010devi\u0107 and Nopcsa, although in a different way, have underlined in their respective works.\"</ref>\n\n===Medieval Ottoman period===\n\nDuring the 14th century Upper Reka was part of the Lordship of Prilep, of the Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 family, until 1395, when its territory was subjugated to Bayezid I of the Ottoman Empire.

[This is confirmed and recognized researcher Galaba Palikru\u0161eva here 40 years ago in a paper which is mentioned here above (''Nekoi elementi na etni\u010dkata istorija na Gorni Polog, Mavrovsko i Gorna Reka''). Investigating about this issue in the region of Reka From the upper half of the 15th century, the Turkish defter's recordings of the population, the scholar noted the presence of significant non-slavic element in this region: Quite the opposite is the situation in Upper Reka, - who underlines it -, where the ethnic non-Slavic element prevails, which cannot assert the absolute truth to what extent is the element of the Albanian ethnic group as opposed to a Vlach one.  In the village of Ribnica and Vrben most people have the patronymic -''iq'' but among them regarding Slavic names emerge personal names that testify to other backgrounds like ''Gin Cicoviq'', ''Nin\u00e7e Lazaroviq'', ose ''Miho Tanusheviq'' (from Tanush). In other villages similar cases arise like ''Gjin Mihaiq'', ''Gjon Qirkoviq'', ''Doka Mihaiq'' etc. The impact from abroad about patronymic changes here however is clear. But basically the names and surnames in this area speak for non-slavic belonging to their holders. For an illustration, we will mention two or three villages in this province: Ni\u00e7pur: ''Gjon Dum'', ''Pop Nikolla'', ''Mesio Sholed'', ''Gjon Shirqe'', ''Gjoro Qirqe'', ''Kole Dum'', ''\u00c7iko i biri i Qirkos'', ''Petko i biri i Miko-s''; Brodec: ''Like Mihail'', ''Plise Nikosllav'', ''Stanishe Xaxi'', ''Llazar Mihail''; Strazimir: ''Kole Shirki'', ''Kole Ri\u00e7'', ''Gjon Shirki'', ''Kole Mihail'', ''Pal Mihail''; V\u00ebrben: ''Girgj Llu\u00e7'', ''Markin Popoviq'', ''Vasill''..., ''Menko''...''Vasko Llu\u00e7'', ''Llazar Kolje'', ''Petar Skore'', ''Shuk Rusi'', ''Kole Dornaj'', ''Petar Ri\u00e7'', etc. As a result of this, so sensitive is the presence of the Albanian element in Reka Upper in the middle of the 15th century that this reasercher reaches the right conclusion when he says: ''The dominant non-slavic ethnic element in Upper Reka in this period(during the middle half of the 15th century) gives us a completely different picture about the issue of language the Albanian of the native Christian population of this area, which today feels and is known as Macedonian. Explaining the occurrence of this phenomenon by some works of researchers as a result of accepting the Albanian language by Macedonian Slavs in order to preserve the Christian faith, can hardly be accepted''. I refer you to the Turkish records of the 15th century of the Vilayet of Reka (''Vilayet-i Reka'', Defteri Nr. 508, 1467), we see that even in other Upper Reka settlements  and that of the lower one encounters people holding Albanian names like: Volkovija: ''Progon Tome''; Trnica (regjistruar Tirni\u00e7a): ''Gerg, son of Andreas''; Vrben (Virbin): ''Petar Tanusheviq'', ''Gin Shimjat'', ''Gin Gegoviq''; Krakornica: ''Gon Du\u00e7e'', ''Gon Kirkit'', ''Miho Meksha''; Nistrovo: ''Kole Bard'', ''Gon Pashajet''; Ribnica: ''Miho Tanusheviq'', ''Bojko Tanusheviq'', etc. (TD 1976).]\"</ref><ref

[In the census books from the 15th century within contemporary settlements in the Upper Reka area are encountered names of a Slavic and non-Slavic character.  It is relatively difficult to determine the origin of these names, whether it was Aromanian or Albanian names. But, given that within current day Albanian names there is not one from then; it seems that Vlach names at that time prevailed in the area. With that we associate the names Vlash Tanush, Gon Vlash, Duka (Doka) Mihail, Lazar (son of) Kalina, Miho Shalis.  It is undisputed that some of these Upper Reka families have distant Vlach origins that in the period before the 15th century began intensively to become slavicised. Yet there endures the Aromanian (Vlach) impact on names and is sustained also on the Albanian population in this region, as in some neighboring areas. Therefore, it is almost impossible to say for certain whether in some cases the Albanian, Vlach ethnic or mutual interpenetration that testify to names: Gerg son of Andreya, Dabich Loz(e) Progon Tome, Dzheko son of Gerg, Miho Meksha, Petko son of Miho.]\"; p. 150. \"\u0432\u043e \u0416\u0443\u0436\u045a\u0435 \u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043a \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0434... \u0418 \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e \u041d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0443\u043a \u0413\u0438\u043d \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043a (\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0428\u0438\u0440\u043a) \u0438 \u0458\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043a \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0438 \u0413\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043a, \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e.

[Mainly over there in the north-east, in the northern area of the Reka region is known by the name Big Reka, populated only by Albanians. Here there are 23 Albanian villages from which only one village Duf, administratively falls in the Tetovo kaza. Largely of most inhabitants here they are Orthodox Christians. Albanians in Big Reka are old inhabitants in the region. There might have been Bulgarians who have become Albanianized. Reka inhabitants kept their religion over a longer period and some hid it within the region. Intensive Islamisation occurred during the end of XVIII century and continued until the latter half of XIX century. The last Islamisation occurred more than around the year 1855 in the village of Shtirovitsa when the last 30 Christian houses accepted Islam.

[All of the population of Upper Reka, again regardless of ethnic and religious affiliation of neighboring regions, is known by the exonym \"Shkreti.\" And this happens to be the exonym retained until today. \"Shkrete\" in Albanian speech means \"deserted\". According to descriptions of ethnological and ethno-physical features, provided by some authors (Cviji\u0107, Nedeljkovi\u0107, to some extent, Smiljani\u0107), in general the population of Upper Reka, as you can see that it was really difficult and painful to live in constant fear of attacks, robberies and murder, living in \"the wilderness\" as stated today in Upper Reka. That area was \"desolate\" in the sense of living in the most difficult in terms of robberies, known by the population from neighboring areas especially Mavrovo Pole, and the Upper Polog and Lower Reka. So using the Albanian form \"shkreto\" for \"desolate\" is precisely why the population of Mavrovo Pole employed this exonym most. Ethnonym/exonym is used today in the area, but only by Mavrovci and Lower Rekans while an inhabitant of Upper Reka never would call himself a \"Shkret.\" While talking to Upper Rekans who live in the area, often they used the word \"shkreto\" when they wanted to explain how hard life in the past was in Upper Reka. Even when speaking of other things that have nothing to do with the hard life of the past, it is still used. For them the word \"shkreto\" has no status of an ethnonym, but for all other neighboring areas it is an ethnonym/exonym that identify people from Upper Reka.]\"</ref><ref name=\"Murati123\"/> Of the Albanian speaking populations who remained Christian Orthodox, they assimilated and identify as Macedonians,<ref name=\"Bechev2009\"/><ref name=\"Mircevska132\"/> while those who embraced Islam consider themselves Albanians.<ref name=\"Mircevska132\">{{harvnb|Mir\u010devska|2007|p=132}}.\"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438, \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0438.

[The current situation of the Macedonian Upper Reka population regarding the use of Albanian speech in everyday mutual verbal communication is unchanged. All who live in the area, even small children, use the Albanian language, although they know Macedonian too. When I worked in this area, with me of course Macedonian was communicated, but in mutual conversations again was done in Albanian. This situation unequivocally tells us that in the past the Macedonian language was used in mutual communication in Gorna Reka, because only with continued use of a language that can it be preserved, otherwise it would be lost, as in Upper River it was not the case. In Upper Reka villages, the Macedonian population knows only spoken Albanian, but cannot read and write in Albanian. In contrast, they can read and write in Macedonian, although rarely used in everyday life and it is just young who do. Upper Reka people living in Skopje or in other cities in Macedonia or abroad, in the former Yugoslavia, although most of them know Upper Reka Albanian speech, however they rarely reveal it. It is because they have Macedonian Christian names and surnames that do not cause difficulties, though from the other side when discussing personal matters, there is a little or widespread negative attitude towards the Albanian language, which is particularly acute in recent years. Even the rest of the Macedonian population in the country is not aware about the existence of a part of the Macedonian nation who use Albanian speech daily, and knowledge of the existence of this occurrence seem unlikely.  This occurrence is not unique to Upper Reka, but the Skopski Derven, Debar, Golo Brdo etc.]\"</ref>\n\n===Observances, Customs and other folk culture===\n{{See also|Culture of Upper Reka}}\n\nIn Upper Reka, a number of secular and religious holidays are celebrated.

One of the earliest authors to write about the matter was Serbian journalist [[Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107]]. In his now discredited work regarding the Balkans,<ref name=\"Promitzer204205\">{{harvnb|Promitzer|2015|pp=204\u2013205}}.\"In 1889 the journalist Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 (1855-1936) published an allegedly scientific, but for all intents and purposes Serbian nationalist monograph on Macedonia and \u201cOld Serbia\u201d (i.e. Kosovo). Gop\u010devi\u0107\u2019s biographer nevertheless argues that the monograph is not the result of authentic experiences and that he was never in Kosovo. While his manipulations with respect the allegedly Serbian character of Macedonia have already been the topic of exhaustive research, his views on the mutual relations between the Serbian and Albanian populations of Kosovo, in particular with respect to the contested notion of so- called Arnauta\u0161\u201d (Albanians of alleged Serbian (descent), have been only addressed superficially by various authors. Whatever the final judgment might be, Gop\u010devi\u0107\u2019s monograph represents a singular attempt to combine sympathies for the cultural development of the Serbian nation with the aspirations of Austria-Hungary as a Great Power in the Balkans.\"</ref> Gop\u010devi\u0107 claimed that Upper Reka inhabitants were \u201cAlbanianized Slavs\u201d.<ref name=\"Pieroni2b\">{{harvnb|Pieroni|Rexhepi|Nedelcheva|Hajdari|2013|p=2}}. \"The upper Reka Valley in Western Macedonia represents one of the very few Albanian-speaking areas in South Eastern Europe where a very detailed ethnographic account - including important notes concerning local food and medicinal plant uses - was written in the first decade of the 20th Century. Bajazid Elmaz Doda (approx. 1888 \u2013 1933) was the personal assistant and long-term partner of one of the most famous scholars in the field of Albanian studies: the Hungarian aristocrat and palaeontologist Baron Franz Nopcsa von Fels\u00f6-Szilv\u00e1s (1877 \u2013 1933). Doda finalised a manuscript in 1914, probably written in collaboration with his mentor/partner, which was focused on the daily mountain life of his village, Shtirovica, located in the upper Reka Valley (approx. 1400 m.a.s.l.). This manuscript remained unpublished until the Albanologist Robert Elsie found it in the Austrian National Library and edited it in 2007. Doda apparently wrote this account to challenge the argument of the Serbian-Austrian historian and astronomer Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 (1855 - 1928), who described the Albanians of the upper Reka Valley as \u201calbanicised Slavs\u201d. Doda\u2019s village of Shtirovica was completely destroyed in 1916 by the Bulgarian army. However, a few surrounding tiny Albanian villages still survive to this day, despite the fact that the local population has been dramatically eroded by recent migration waves, both to the main centres in Macedonia and also abroad. The aim of this study was to record the traditional plant knowledge of the last remaining Albanians living in these villages of the upper Reka Valley and to compare this with the ethnobotanical notes found in Doda\u2019s work in order to better understand trajectories of change in plant uses.\"</ref> In the late 1890s \u0160tilijan \u010caparoski and folklorist Panajot Ginoski, both from [[Gali\u010dnik]], Dolna Reka, maintained that Upper Reka inhabitants spoke a corrupted form of Albanian that was understood only by the locals, and contained a mixture of Slavic and Albanians words.<ref name=\"Anastasovski86a\">{{harvnb|Anastasovski|2008|p=86}}. \"At the end of the nineteenth century in the Upper Reka district villages, a corrupted form of Albanian was spoken by both Muslims and Christians alike. It was neither the language of their forefathers, nor their mother tongue, but a mixture of Albanian and Macedonian words, making the language unique and comprehensible only among themselves.\"</ref><ref name=\"Murati91\">{{harvnb|Murati|2011|p=91}}. \"Vo Mala Reka se zborvit mija\u010dki jozik, nego go zborvet i Turci i risjani; a vo Golema Reka se zborvet arnautski jozik, ama sporti drugiot jozik arnautski (\u0161kipetarski), rekanskiot jazik arnautski je podebel i me\u0161an so mija\u010dki.

This may confirm the findings of both our linguistic analysis on the folk plant names carried out in Table 1 and also Franz Nopcsa\u2019s ethnolinguistic analysis of the terms referring to the material culture in upper Reka, which showed very important loans from the Romanian and especially Slavic languages. It can thus be postulated that the upper Reka Albanians had been heavily influenced by the Slavic culture - and not vice versa, as Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 stated. Study participants confirmed that over recent decades their most important markets and \u201cexchange\u201d centres have been the multi-ethnic (Macedonian, Albanian, and Turk) towns of Gostivar in Western Macedonia and Prizren, in Southern Kosovo. Moreover, it must also be noted that over the span of the last century, the Albanians of the upper Reka lived outside of the borders of the Albanian state (founded in 1912), and for the major part of this period within the former Socialist Republic of Macedonia within Yugoslavia, where the dominant culture and languages have been Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian. In other words, the remarkable \u201c interference\u201d of the Slavic cultures found within the domain of Albanian traditional plant knowledge of the upper Reka represents a unique phenomenon, which nowadays is not easy to trace back in detail. This could be due to the difficulty faced in establishing to which degree the Slavic culture influenced the traditional knowledge among Albanians in the upper Reka, considering the role that ancient \u201chybridisations\u201d may have played, as both Gop\u010devi\u0107 and Nopcsa, although in a different way, have underlined in their respective works.\"</ref>\n\n===Medieval Ottoman period===\n\nDuring the 14th century Upper Reka was part of the Lordship of Prilep, of the Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 family, until 1395, when its territory was subjugated to Bayezid I of the Ottoman Empire.

[This is confirmed and recognized researcher Galaba Palikru\u0161eva here 40 years ago in a paper which is mentioned here above (''Nekoi elementi na etni\u010dkata istorija na Gorni Polog, Mavrovsko i Gorna Reka''). Investigating about this issue in the region of Reka From the upper half of the 15th century, the Turkish defter's recordings of the population, the scholar noted the presence of significant non-slavic element in this region: Quite the opposite is the situation in Upper Reka, - who underlines it -, where the ethnic non-Slavic element prevails, which cannot assert the absolute truth to what extent is the element of the Albanian ethnic group as opposed to a Vlach one.  In the village of Ribnica and Vrben most people have the patronymic -''iq'' but among them regarding Slavic names emerge personal names that testify to other backgrounds like ''Gin Cicoviq'', ''Nin\u00e7e Lazaroviq'', ose ''Miho Tanusheviq'' (from Tanush). In other villages similar cases arise like ''Gjin Mihaiq'', ''Gjon Qirkoviq'', ''Doka Mihaiq'' etc. The impact from abroad about patronymic changes here however is clear. But basically the names and surnames in this area speak for non-slavic belonging to their holders. For an illustration, we will mention two or three villages in this province: Ni\u00e7pur: ''Gjon Dum'', ''Pop Nikolla'', ''Mesio Sholed'', ''Gjon Shirqe'', ''Gjoro Qirqe'', ''Kole Dum'', ''\u00c7iko i biri i Qirkos'', ''Petko i biri i Miko-s''; Brodec: ''Like Mihail'', ''Plise Nikosllav'', ''Stanishe Xaxi'', ''Llazar Mihail''; Strazimir: ''Kole Shirki'', ''Kole Ri\u00e7'', ''Gjon Shirki'', ''Kole Mihail'', ''Pal Mihail''; V\u00ebrben: ''Girgj Llu\u00e7'', ''Markin Popoviq'', ''Vasill''..., ''Menko''...''Vasko Llu\u00e7'', ''Llazar Kolje'', ''Petar Skore'', ''Shuk Rusi'', ''Kole Dornaj'', ''Petar Ri\u00e7'', etc. As a result of this, so sensitive is the presence of the Albanian element in Reka Upper in the middle of the 15th century that this reasercher reaches the right conclusion when he says: ''The dominant non-slavic ethnic element in Upper Reka in this period(during the middle half of the 15th century) gives us a completely different picture about the issue of language the Albanian of the native Christian population of this area, which today feels and is known as Macedonian. Explaining the occurrence of this phenomenon by some works of researchers as a result of accepting the Albanian language by Macedonian Slavs in order to preserve the Christian faith, can hardly be accepted''. I refer you to the Turkish records of the 15th century of the Vilayet of Reka (''Vilayet-i Reka'', Defteri Nr. 508, 1467), we see that even in other Upper Reka settlements  and that of the lower one encounters people holding Albanian names like: Volkovija: ''Progon Tome''; Trnica (regjistruar Tirni\u00e7a): ''Gerg, son of Andreas''; Vrben (Virbin): ''Petar Tanusheviq'', ''Gin Shimjat'', ''Gin Gegoviq''; Krakornica: ''Gon Du\u00e7e'', ''Gon Kirkit'', ''Miho Meksha''; Nistrovo: ''Kole Bard'', ''Gon Pashajet''; Ribnica: ''Miho Tanusheviq'', ''Bojko Tanusheviq'', etc. (TD 1976).]\"</ref><ref

[In the census books from the 15th century within contemporary settlements in the Upper Reka area are encountered names of a Slavic and non-Slavic character.  It is relatively difficult to determine the origin of these names, whether it was Aromanian or Albanian names. But, given that within current day Albanian names there is not one from then; it seems that Vlach names at that time prevailed in the area. With that we associate the names Vlash Tanush, Gon Vlash, Duka (Doka) Mihail, Lazar (son of) Kalina, Miho Shalis.  It is undisputed that some of these Upper Reka families have distant Vlach origins that in the period before the 15th century began intensively to become slavicised. Yet there endures the Aromanian (Vlach) impact on names and is sustained also on the Albanian population in this region, as in some neighboring areas. Therefore, it is almost impossible to say for certain whether in some cases the Albanian, Vlach ethnic or mutual interpenetration that testify to names: Gerg son of Andreya, Dabich Loz(e) Progon Tome, Dzheko son of Gerg, Miho Meksha, Petko son of Miho.]\"; p. 150. \"\u0432\u043e \u0416\u0443\u0436\u045a\u0435 \u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043a \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0434... \u0418 \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e \u041d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0443\u043a \u0413\u0438\u043d \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043a (\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0428\u0438\u0440\u043a) \u0438 \u0458\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043a \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0438 \u0413\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0428\u0435\u0440\u043a, \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].\n\n{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}\n\n===Incisional abscess===\nAn ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\n\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess\nfile:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|[[Pyaemia|Pyemic]] abscesses of [[kidney]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:UOTW 66 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Ultrasound showing an abscess of the skin<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #66 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=7 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102223449/http://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|archivedate=2 November 2016}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Ultrasound image of breast 110323101432 1023060.jpg|Ultrasound image of breast abscess, appearing as a mushroom-shaped dark (hypoechoic) area|thumb]]\n\nAn abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by the pyogenic membrane.<ref>Robins/8th/68</ref> [[Ultrasound]] imaging in the emergency department can help in a diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbic|first1=D|last2=Chenkin|first2=J|last3=Cho|first3=DD|last4=Jelic|first4=T|last5=Scheuermeyer|first5=FX|title=In patients presenting to the emergency department with skin and soft tissue infections what is the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of abscess compared to the current standard of care?

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than an abscess, consideration should be given to the possibility of the strep species as a cause, that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin, in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to the possibility of the strep species as a cause, that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin, in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]] and [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket, alongside [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Noah Taylor]], [[Missi Pyle]], [[James Fox]], [[Deep Roy]], and [[Christopher Lee]]. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.\n\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (filmed previously as ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl Estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while actors [[Bill Murray]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]], [[Adam Sandler]], and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.\n\nBurton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (which was produced by Burton) that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to positive critical reviews and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=charliechocolate.htm|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Charlie Bucket]] is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company. The company's owner, [[Willy Wonka]], has long closed his factory due to problems concerning [[industrial espionage]] that led him to fire all his employees, including Charlie's [[Grandpa Joe]]. Charlie's father, meanwhile, has recently been made redundant at work.\n\nOne day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random [[Wonka Bar]]s worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive a special prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found fairly quickly. The recipients are [[Augustus Gloop]], a gluttonous German boy; [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]], a [[Spoiled child|spoiled]] English girl; [[Violet Beauregarde]], an arrogant gum chewer; and [[Mike Teavee]], an ill-tempered television and video game addict. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in [[Russia]], Charlie finds a ten-dollar note, and purchases a Wonka Bar at a news shop. At the exact moment it is revealed that the Russian ticket was forged, and Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. Charlie receives monetary offers for the ticket, but after a pep talk from  Grandpa George (who tells Charlie that \"only a dummy\" would give up an extremely rare Golden Ticket \"for something as common as money\"), decides to keep it and bring Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the factory tour.\n\nCharlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause four children to give into temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour, while the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s sing a song of morality after each elimination. During the tour, flashbacks reveal Wonka's troubled past; his father, a prominent dentist named Wilbur, strictly forbade Wonka from consuming candy due to the potential risk to his teeth, and also made Wonka wear uncomfortable braces. After sneaking over a piece of candy, Wonka was instantly hooked, and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, both his father and their house were gone. After the tour, the four children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination, while Charlie learns that Wonka, now approaching retirement, intended to find a worthy heir to his factory. Since Charlie was the \"least rotten\" of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, on the condition that Charlie leave his family behind, just as Wonka did. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.\n\nCharlie and his family live contently a while later; however, Wonka is too depressed to make candy the way he used to, causing his candy to sell poorly and his company to decline. He turns to Charlie for advice. Charlie decides to help Wonka confront and reconcile with his estranged father; Wonka finally realizes the value of family, while his father learns to accept his son for who he is, and not what he does.

Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' \"melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> The \"TV Room\" was patterned after photographs from the films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', and ''[[THX 1138]]''. ''Danger Diabolik'' also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nTim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment.<ref>{{cite news | author = Jamie Graham | title = 2005 Summer Preview: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | date = May 2005 | work = [[Total Film]] }}</ref> As a result, [[forced perspective]] techniques, oversized props and [[scale model]]s were used to avoid [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref name=\"faber\" /> [[Deep Roy]] was cast to play the [[List of characters in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompas]] based on his previous collaborations with Burton on ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[Big Fish]]''.

A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for the beginnings of the swelling scene, before the decision was made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.\n\nRather than rely on CGI, Burton wanted the 40 [[squirrel]]s in the Nut Room to be real. The animals were trained every day for 10 weeks before filming commenced. They began their coaching while newborns, fed by bottles to form relationships with human trainers. The squirrels were each taught how to sit upon a little blue bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt.<ref name=\"nut\" /> \"Ultimately, the scene was supplemented by CGI and [[animatronics]],\" Burton said, \"but for the close-ups and the main action, they're the real thing.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> Wonka's Viking boat for the Chocolate River sequence floats down a realistic river filled with 192,000 gallons of faux melted chocolate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.technologytell.com/hometech/82983/hometechtell-review-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-blu-ray/|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Blu-Ray review |date=January 30, 2012 |publisher=TechnologyTell |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref> \"Having seen the first film, we wanted to make the chocolate river look edible,\" McDowell said. \"In the first film, it's so distasteful.\" The production first considered a CGI river, but Burton was impressed with the artificial substance when he saw how it clung to the boat's oars.

The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]] and [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket, alongside [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Noah Taylor]], [[Missi Pyle]], [[James Fox]], [[Deep Roy]], and [[Christopher Lee]]. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.\n\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (filmed previously as ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl Estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while actors [[Bill Murray]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]], [[Adam Sandler]], and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.\n\nBurton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (which was produced by Burton) that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to positive critical reviews and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=charliechocolate.htm|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Charlie Bucket]] is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company. The company's owner, [[Willy Wonka]], has long closed his factory due to problems concerning [[industrial espionage]] that led him to fire all his employees, including Charlie's [[Grandpa Joe]]. Charlie's father, meanwhile, has recently been made redundant at work.\n\nOne day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random [[Wonka Bar]]s worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive a special prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found fairly quickly. The recipients are [[Augustus Gloop]], a gluttonous German boy; [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]], a [[Spoiled child|spoiled]] English girl; [[Violet Beauregarde]], an arrogant gum chewer; and [[Mike Teavee]], an ill-tempered television and video game addict. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in [[Russia]], Charlie finds a ten-dollar note, and purchases a Wonka Bar at a news shop. At the exact moment it is revealed that the Russian ticket was forged, and Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. Charlie receives monetary offers for the ticket, but after a pep talk from  Grandpa George (who tells Charlie that \"only a dummy\" would give up an extremely rare Golden Ticket \"for something as common as money\"), decides to keep it and bring Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the factory tour.\n\nCharlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause four children to give into temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour, while the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s sing a song of morality after each elimination. During the tour, flashbacks reveal Wonka's troubled past; his father, a prominent dentist named Wilbur, strictly forbade Wonka from consuming candy due to the potential risk to his teeth, and also made Wonka wear uncomfortable braces. After sneaking over a piece of candy, Wonka was instantly hooked, and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, both his father and their house were gone. After the tour, the four children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination, while Charlie learns that Wonka, now approaching retirement, intended to find a worthy heir to his factory. Since Charlie was the \"least rotten\" of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, on the condition that Charlie leave his family behind, just as Wonka did. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.\n\nCharlie and his family live contently a while later; however, Wonka is too depressed to make candy the way he used to, causing his candy to sell poorly and his company to decline.

Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' \"melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> The \"TV Room\" was patterned after photographs from the films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', and ''[[THX 1138]]''. ''Danger Diabolik'' also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nTim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment.<ref>{{cite news | author = Jamie Graham | title = 2005 Summer Preview: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | date = May 2005 | work = [[Total Film]] }}</ref> As a result, [[forced perspective]] techniques, oversized props and [[scale model]]s were used to avoid [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref name=\"faber\" /> [[Deep Roy]] was cast to play the [[List of characters in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory#Oompa-Loompas|Oompa-Loompas]] based on his previous collaborations with Burton on ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[Big Fish]]''.

A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for the beginnings of the swelling scene, before the decision was made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.\n\nRather than rely on CGI, Burton wanted the 40 [[squirrel]]s in the Nut Room to be real. The animals were trained every day for 10 weeks before filming commenced. They began their coaching while newborns, fed by bottles to form relationships with human trainers. The squirrels were each taught how to sit upon a little blue bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt.<ref name=\"nut\" /> \"Ultimately, the scene was supplemented by CGI and [[animatronics]],\" Burton said, \"but for the close-ups and the main action, they're the real thing.\"<ref name=\"faber\" /> Wonka's Viking boat for the Chocolate River sequence floats down a realistic river filled with 192,000 gallons of faux melted chocolate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.technologytell.com/hometech/82983/hometechtell-review-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-blu-ray/|title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Blu-Ray review |date=January 30, 2012 |publisher=TechnologyTell |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref> \"Having seen the first film, we wanted to make the chocolate river look edible,\" McDowell said. \"In the first film, it's so distasteful.\" The production first considered a CGI river, but Burton was impressed with the artificial substance when he saw how it clung to the boat's oars.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993. The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>.

Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref> \n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]].

'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993. The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>.

He began playing drums at the age of three. His father, Salvatore Erna, was a trumpet player and would rehearse in the basement where Sully would watch and fall asleep in an empty guitar case. His great-uncle was a famous composer in Sicily, where every year they honor his music. At the age of 11, he discovered that it was easier for him to listen to something and play it than read sheet music. He stopped taking lessons and practiced at home, rehearsing to records by [[Aerosmith]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/godsmack-sully-erna-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction-part-1/ |title=Godsmack's Sully Erna Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?\u2019 \u2013 Part 1 |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=July 16, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nAt 14, Dave Vose became his new instructor. He signed his first record deal in 1993 with a band called Strip Mind. Their debut album ''What's in Your Mouth'' sold fewer than 50,000 units. Then some of the band members (mainly the singer) and Erna didn't get along, and he was booted out. They split-up shortly after. In Godsmack concerts he plays the [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and a large drum set, staging a drumming duel known as \"Batalla de los Tambores\" with drummer [[Shannon Larkin]]. This battle has become a staple of the band's live show. He is also a harmonica player as present on the [[Godsmack]] song \"Shine Down.\" In 2010, Sully released his first solo album ''[[Avalon (Sully Erna album)|Avalon]]''. The album took seven years to complete and differed stylistically from Godsmack. Sully wrapped up his acoustic tour with one final show at The House of Blues in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 28.\n\nErna has also worked with his local music scene.

The shows have combined [[Godsmack]] songs with a few new originals and covers ranging from [[The Beatles]] to [[Alice in Chains]] to the theme from ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''.\n\nRegarding how he went about selecting the material used for his solo show, Erna said, \"I wanted to stick a couple of originals in and try them out because there was a couple of songs that were done on the piano or the guitar that I wrote that I don't think I would use on a GODSMACK record,\" he said. \"For example, 'Eyes of a Child' and 'Until Then'. It was a great opportunity to showcase that and see if I can hit home with the people on those two pieces. Those songs are the most emotional pieces of the evening. One song is about children born with or dying from AIDS and the other is about a tribute to the troops of the United States Armed Forces.\"\n\nErna told The Pulse of Radio that playing some new material live is a good way for him to test out songs that might not work for [[Godsmack]]. \"We're all musicians and we like to write music and not necessarily rock all the time,\" he said. \"So, you know, if I sit home and I'm writing on the piano and sometimes just cool songs are written that don't necessarily fit maybe what you do with [[Godsmack]], but you don't wanna not record them.\"\n\nErna stated at the time that he planned to work on his first solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=99848 |title=Godsmack Frontman Performs Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters' \u2013 June 27, 2008 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2009, Blabbermouth.net reported that Erna had completed work on his first solo album, ''[[Avalon (Sully Erna album)|Avalon]]'', released September 14, 2010.

He began playing drums at the age of three. His father, Salvatore Erna, was a trumpet player and would rehearse in the basement where Sully would watch and fall asleep in an empty guitar case. His great-uncle was a famous composer in Sicily, where every year they honor his music. At the age of 11, he discovered that it was easier for him to listen to something and play it than read sheet music. He stopped taking lessons and practiced at home, rehearsing to records by [[Aerosmith]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/godsmack-sully-erna-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction-part-1/ |title=Godsmack's Sully Erna Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?\u2019 \u2013 Part 1 |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=July 16, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nAt 14, Dave Vose became his new instructor. He signed his first record deal in 1993 with a band called Strip Mind. Their debut album ''What's in Your Mouth'' sold fewer than 50,000 units. Then some of the band members (mainly the singer) and Erna didn't get along, and he was booted out. They split-up shortly after. In Godsmack concerts he plays the [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and a large drum set, staging a drumming duel known as \"Batalla de los Tambores\" with drummer [[Shannon Larkin]]. This battle has become a staple of the band's live show. He is also a harmonica player as present on the [[Godsmack]] song \"Shine Down.\" In 2010, Sully released his first solo album ''[[Avalon (Sully Erna album)|Avalon]]''. The album took seven years to complete and differed stylistically from Godsmack. Sully wrapped up his acoustic tour with one final show at The House of Blues in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 28.\n\nErna has also worked with his local music scene. In April 2005, Sully participated in New Hampshire's Battle of the Bands Competition. The winner (a band called Zion who hails from Salem) had the opportunity to record a demo at Sully's California studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newhampshire.com/nh-people/sully-erna-biography.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714204522/http://www.newhampshire.com/nh-people/sully-erna-biography.aspx|url-status=dead|title=New Hampshire People \u2013 Sully Erna of Godsmack NewHampshire.com|archivedate=July 14, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Solo work===\nErna told Glam-Metal.com that doing his first solo shows were \"extremely nerve-wracking,\" adding, \"My first show, I was really, really nervous. Honestly, I haven't been that nervous since I was, I don't know, maybe 10 years old at a talent show or something.\" Erna kicked off his first solo acoustic trek on 1 May in Niagara Falls, New York and closed it out on May 31 in Las Vegas. The shows have combined [[Godsmack]] songs with a few new originals and covers ranging from [[The Beatles]] to [[Alice in Chains]] to the theme from ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''.\n\nRegarding how he went about selecting the material used for his solo show, Erna said, \"I wanted to stick a couple of originals in and try them out because there was a couple of songs that were done on the piano or the guitar that I wrote that I don't think I would use on a GODSMACK record,\" he said. \"For example, 'Eyes of a Child' and 'Until Then'. It was a great opportunity to showcase that and see if I can hit home with the people on those two pieces. Those songs are the most emotional pieces of the evening. One song is about children born with or dying from AIDS and the other is about a tribute to the troops of the United States Armed Forces.\"\n\nErna told The Pulse of Radio that playing some new material live is a good way for him to test out songs that might not work for [[Godsmack]]. \"We're all musicians and we like to write music and not necessarily rock all the time,\" he said. \"So, you know, if I sit home and I'm writing on the piano and sometimes just cool songs are written that don't necessarily fit maybe what you do with [[Godsmack]], but you don't wanna not record them.\"\n\nErna stated at the time that he planned to work on his first solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=99848 |title=Godsmack Frontman Performs Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters' \u2013 June 27, 2008 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2009, Blabbermouth.net reported that Erna had completed work on his first solo album, ''[[Avalon (Sully Erna album)|Avalon]]'', released September 14, 2010.
