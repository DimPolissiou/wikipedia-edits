Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry Giroux|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLRWPsIzSOo&list=RD94hM2wkA1mw&index=3|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Amongst various other issues impending on society today, Casablancas is most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the [[University of New Hampshire]] the night before the New Hampshire primary.<ref> {{url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/the-strokes-bernie-sanders-rally-in-new-hampshire/}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n[[Courtney Love]]'s song \"But Julian, I'm a Little Bit Older Than You\", from her debut solo album ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' (2004), was written

In 2015, it was the [[Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic|fourth busiest airport]] in the United Kingdom after [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]]. Stansted's runway is also used by private companies such as the [[Harrods Aviation]], [[Titan Airways]] and XJet terminals which are private ground handlers who are able to handle private flights, charter flights and state visits.\n\nOriginally owned and operated by [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|BAA]], since February 2013 the airport has been owned [[Manchester Airports Group]] (MAG) following a March 2009 ruling by the Competition Commission.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stansted Airport being sold to Manchester for \u00a31.5bn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21093783 |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u00a31.5&nbsp;billion Stansted Airport sale complete |author=Sinead Holland |url=http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/News/Harlow-news/15-billion-Stansted-Airport-sale-complete-20130228174702.htm |newspaper=Harlow Star |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nLondon Stansted Airport has one main passenger terminal, near the village of [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]. There are three passenger satellites in which the departure gates are situated; one is connected to the main terminal by an air-bridge and the other two by the [[Stansted Airport Transit System]] people mover.\n\nThe terminal building was designed by [[Foster and Partners|Foster Associates]] with input from the structural engineer [[Peter Rice]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-genius-expressed-in-nuts-and-bolts-peter-rice-is-an-engineer-revered-by-the-worlds-top-1530478.html|title=Architecture: Genius expressed in nuts and bolts: Peter Rice is an|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>  and features a \"floating\" roof, supported by a [[space frame]] of inverted-pyramid roof trusses, creating the impression of a stylised swan in flight. The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, go through security and on to the departure gates all on the same level.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted saw rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24&nbsp;million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years to 2012. Passenger totals later increased, and in 2016 recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3&nbsp;million and numbers have since continued to rise.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Before Stansted Airport aa.jpg|thumb|300px|Where Stansted Airport is now, as about 1935]]\n[[File:B-26-stanst.jpg|thumb|A [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] of the 344th Bomb Group at Stansted, 1944.]]\n[[File:Avro 685 York XF919.G-AMUS Air Charter STA 10.4.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Avro York]] of the based [[Air Charter Limited|Air Charter Ltd]] taking off on a trooping flight in 1955 with wartime hangars in the background]]\n===Second World War===\n{{Main article|RAF Stansted Mountfitchet}}\n\nThe airfield opened in 1943 and was used during the Second World War as [[RAF Stansted Mountfitchet]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\n\nThe station was first allocated to the [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] in August 1942 as a heavy bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an [[Air Materiel Command#Air Technical Services Command|Air Technical Services Command]] (ATSC) maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\n\n===Post-war use===\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the [[Air Ministry]] and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services (LAMS), equipped with ex-RAF [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70-1\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to [[NATO]]. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under [[BAA Limited|BAA]] control in 1966.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the Fire Service Training School (FSTS) was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields as well as those of many overseas countries.\n\n===Commercial operations===\n[[File:London Stansted Airport main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Terminal building at night]]\n[[File:London Stansted Airport - Baggage reclaim.jpg|thumb|The Arrivals hall in the Terminal building, which was extended in 2008.]]\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\n[[File:London Stansted Airport Air View.jpg|thumb|View of Stansted from the air.]]\n\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford In 1966-67 the Government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"[[Roskill Commission]]\") of 1968-71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that [[Cublington]] in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport.<ref>Roskill (1971). ''Report, Commission on the Third London Airport''. London: HMSO.</ref> However, the Conservative Government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed. But, in 1974, the incoming Labour Government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=Inside London's Airports Policy: Indecision, decision and counter-decision|last=Le Blond|first=Paul|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763655|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nStansted was then considered as an option for long term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy (ACAP) and the Study Group on South East Airports (SGSEA) and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative Government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981-83. The Inspector's Report was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a White Paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15&nbsp;million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nThe current terminal building was designed by architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. Construction was undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]] and took place between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Ritchie, p. 173</ref> costing \u00a3100&nbsp;million.<ref>''Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA''&nbsp;\u2013 1991 (Michael Donne&nbsp;\u2013 BAA plc), p. 62-63</ref> In 1990 it was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award]]. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport, and [[Stansted Airport railway station]] opened in 1991.\n\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in the early 1990s when [[American Airlines]] operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and [[O'Hare International Airport]], however the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news | title = American Airlines to quit Stansted: Long haul carrier scraps Chicago service |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/american-airlines-to-quit-stansted-long-haul-carrier-scraps-chicago-service-1452654.html | first=Michael | last=Harrison | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Continental Airlines]] also operated services in the late 1990s from [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], but this service was stopped shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when [[Eos Airlines]] and [[MAXjet Airways]] commenced all-business-class services from Stansted to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK Airport]]. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington, D.C.]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008.

Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from the airport.\n\n===Latest developments===\nLong haul transatlantic operations made a return to Stansted in June 2010, when [[Sun Country Airlines]] announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to [[Minneapolis]]. The flights made a re-fuelling stop-over in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and were then discontinued due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long haul flights. {{Cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nLong-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2009/03/09/air-asia-x-launches-flights-between-stansted-and-kl/|title=Air Asia X launches flights between Stansted and KL \u2013 Business Traveller|work=Business Traveller|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> with Malaysian low-cost airline [[AirAsia X]] providing direct flights to [[Kuala Lumpur]]; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely.\n\nA major expansion programme to the existing terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, adding nearly {{convert|5900|m2|abbr=on}} of floorspace to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall and a [[hypostyle]] arrivals hall with improved facilities.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Uttlesford]] District Council rejected a [[BAA Limited|BAA]] planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers.

It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\n\n===Other infrastructure===\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and the [[Boeing 747]]. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport. The largest are located at the south east of the airfield, one of which is used by Ryanair.\n\n[[Titan Airways]] has its head office in the Enterprise House on the airport property.<ref>\"[http://www.titan-airways.com/contact-us.html Contact Us].\" Titan Airways.

Visited 20 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\n\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200&nbsp;million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\n\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] to allow time for BAA and the Government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the General Election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.<ref name=\"withdraw\"/>\n\n====Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE)====\nThe [[advocacy group]] Stop Stansted Expansion (\"SSE\"), formed in 2002 as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport [[White Paper]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100519093443/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; The Future of Air Transport \u2013 White Paper and the Civil Aviation Bill]. Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nIt still actively campaigns against what its members see as the unsustainable expansion of the airport. SSE was a major participant in the 2007 \"G1\" public inquiry and had committed to be a major participant in the anticipated inquiry into the 'G2' second runway proposal. Following the withdrawal of the G2 planning application the group called upon BAA to sell the homes it had bought to support the planned expansion.\n\nIn September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the Government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies,<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission Airports Commission]. GOV.UK. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The Commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election the Commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\n\nThroughout 2013, the Airports Commission published discussion papers and invited submissions from key stakeholders on the main issues it wished to consider. SSE made several thorough submissions. SSE also accepted an invitation to give oral evidence and make a presentation to the Commission on aviation demand forecasting and connectivity at a public evidence session held in Manchester in July 2013.<ref>Stansted Airport Airfield Fire Services 30 March 1998 Emerald Airways HS748 engine exploded on take off whilst carrying the Leeds United football team, aircraft written off but no one injured.

MAG has invested \u00a340&nbsp;million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes to walk through the shopping areas to get to the departure gates.\n\nSatellite One has also been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |title=Transport Secretary Launches \u00a380 Million Terminal Redevelopment |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=London Stansted Airport |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234429/http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===New Arrivals Terminal===\nAn arrivals terminal is planned to be built at Stansted, with construction due to begin in 2018, taking three years to complete. The site will include larger immigration and baggage reclaim areas, with more shops and facilities available after arrival into the UK. The current terminal will be reconfigured to departures only, with security and check-in areas due to be expanded.

In 2015, it was the [[Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic|fourth busiest airport]] in the United Kingdom after [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]]. Stansted's runway is also used by private companies such as the [[Harrods Aviation]], [[Titan Airways]] and XJet terminals which are private ground handlers who are able to handle private flights, charter flights and state visits.\n\nOriginally owned and operated by [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|BAA]], since February 2013 the airport has been owned [[Manchester Airports Group]] (MAG) following a March 2009 ruling by the Competition Commission.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stansted Airport being sold to Manchester for \u00a31.5bn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21093783 |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u00a31.5&nbsp;billion Stansted Airport sale complete |author=Sinead Holland |url=http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/News/Harlow-news/15-billion-Stansted-Airport-sale-complete-20130228174702.htm |newspaper=Harlow Star |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nLondon Stansted Airport has one main passenger terminal, near the village of [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]. There are three passenger satellites in which the departure gates are situated; one is connected to the main terminal by an air-bridge and the other two by the [[Stansted Airport Transit System]] people mover.\n\nThe terminal building was designed by [[Foster and Partners|Foster Associates]] with input from the structural engineer [[Peter Rice]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-genius-expressed-in-nuts-and-bolts-peter-rice-is-an-engineer-revered-by-the-worlds-top-1530478.html|title=Architecture: Genius expressed in nuts and bolts: Peter Rice is an|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>  and features a \"floating\" roof, supported by a [[space frame]] of inverted-pyramid roof trusses, creating the impression of a stylised swan in flight. The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, go through security and on to the departure gates all on the same level.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted saw rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24&nbsp;million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years to 2012. Passenger totals later increased, and in 2016 recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3&nbsp;million and numbers have since continued to rise.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Before Stansted Airport aa.jpg|thumb|300px|Where Stansted Airport is now, as about 1935]]\n[[File:B-26-stanst.jpg|thumb|A [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] of the 344th Bomb Group at Stansted, 1944.]]\n[[File:Avro 685 York XF919.G-AMUS Air Charter STA 10.4.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Avro York]] of the based [[Air Charter Limited|Air Charter Ltd]] taking off on a trooping flight in 1955 with wartime hangars in the background]]\n===Second World War===\n{{Main article|RAF Stansted Mountfitchet}}\n\nThe airfield opened in 1943 and was used during the Second World War as [[RAF Stansted Mountfitchet]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\n\nThe station was first allocated to the [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] in August 1942 as a heavy bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an [[Air Materiel Command#Air Technical Services Command|Air Technical Services Command]] (ATSC) maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\n\n===Post-war use===\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the [[Air Ministry]] and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services (LAMS), equipped with ex-RAF [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70-1\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to [[NATO]]. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under [[BAA Limited|BAA]] control in 1966.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the Fire Service Training School (FSTS) was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields as well as those of many overseas countries.\n\n===Commercial operations===\n[[File:London Stansted Airport main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Terminal building at night]]\n[[File:London Stansted Airport - Baggage reclaim.jpg|thumb|The Arrivals hall in the Terminal building, which was extended in 2008.]]\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\n[[File:London Stansted Airport Air View.jpg|thumb|View of Stansted from the air.]]\n\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford In 1966-67 the Government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"[[Roskill Commission]]\") of 1968-71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that [[Cublington]] in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport.<ref>Roskill (1971). ''Report, Commission on the Third London Airport''. London: HMSO.</ref> However, the Conservative Government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed. But, in 1974, the incoming Labour Government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=Inside London's Airports Policy: Indecision, decision and counter-decision|last=Le Blond|first=Paul|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763655|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nStansted was then considered as an option for long term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy (ACAP) and the Study Group on South East Airports (SGSEA) and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative Government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981-83. The Inspector's Report was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a White Paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15&nbsp;million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nThe current terminal building was designed by architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. Construction was undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]] and took place between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Ritchie, p. 173</ref> costing \u00a3100&nbsp;million.<ref>''Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA''&nbsp;\u2013 1991 (Michael Donne&nbsp;\u2013 BAA plc), p. 62-63</ref> In 1990 it was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award]]. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport, and [[Stansted Airport railway station]] opened in 1991.\n\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in the early 1990s when [[American Airlines]] operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and [[O'Hare International Airport]], however the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news | title = American Airlines to quit Stansted: Long haul carrier scraps Chicago service |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/american-airlines-to-quit-stansted-long-haul-carrier-scraps-chicago-service-1452654.html | first=Michael | last=Harrison | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Continental Airlines]] also operated services in the late 1990s from [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], but this service was stopped shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when [[Eos Airlines]] and [[MAXjet Airways]] commenced all-business-class services from Stansted to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK Airport]]. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington, D.C.]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008.

Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from the airport.\n\n===Latest developments===\nLong haul transatlantic operations made a return to Stansted in June 2010, when [[Sun Country Airlines]] announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to [[Minneapolis]]. The flights made a re-fuelling stop-over in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and were then discontinued due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long haul flights. {{Cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nLong-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2009/03/09/air-asia-x-launches-flights-between-stansted-and-kl/|title=Air Asia X launches flights between Stansted and KL \u2013 Business Traveller|work=Business Traveller|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> with Malaysian low-cost airline [[AirAsia X]] providing direct flights to [[Kuala Lumpur]]; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely.\n\nA major expansion programme to the existing terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, adding nearly {{convert|5900|m2|abbr=on}} of floorspace to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall and a [[hypostyle]] arrivals hall with improved facilities.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Uttlesford]] District Council rejected a [[BAA Limited|BAA]] planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers. BAA immediately appealed against the decision and a public inquiry opened lasting from May until October 2007. Planning Inspector Alan Boyland made his recommendations in January 2008. {{Cn|date=May 2017}} Those recommendations were largely followed by the Secretary of State for Transport ([[Geoff Hoon]]) and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), who jointly allowed the applicant's appeal in October 2008. A legal challenge by community campaign group Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) was rejected by the High Court in March 2009. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/13/stop-stansted-loses-legal-battle|title=Stop Stansted Expansion group loses legal battle|last=Percival|first=Jenny|date=2009-03-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, 57 people were arrested after [[Plane Stupid]], the environmental activist group, broke through the barriers and created a 'stockade' on a taxiway which resulted in 52 flights being cancelled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/7771079.stm|title=Runway protest strands passengers|work=BBC News| date=8 December 2008 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Competition Commission ruled in March 2009 that BAA should sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports within two years.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAA could challenge airport sale |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7951377.stm |work=BBC News |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> The ruling was quashed within a year following an appeal but was subsequently upheld.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAA sell-off back on track after court ruling |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11531559 |work=BBC News |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> The Competition Commission reconfirmed its ruling in July 2011 that the airport be sold,<ref>{{cite news|title=BAA loses final Competition Commission sell-off ruling|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14196639|accessdate=19 July 2011|work=BBC News|date=19 July 2011}}</ref> and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] turned down an appeal by BAA on 26 July 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAA loses latest appeal against Stansted sale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19001159 |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> In light of the result, BAA chose not to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and confirmed on 20 August 2012 that the airport would be sold.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stansted Airport to be sold by BAA |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19318094 |work=BBC News |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, [[Antonov Airlines]] opened a UK office at Stansted for cargo charter flights, generally of outsize loads.<ref name=aircargonews-20170220>{{cite news |url=http://www.aircargonews.net/news/airlines/single-view/news/uk-office-handles-antonov-airlines-charter.html |title=UK office handles Antonov Airlines charter |newspaper=aircargonews |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, a group of activists delayed a deportation flight to Nigeria.<ref name=\"batchelor\">{{cite news |last1=Batchelor |first1=Tom |title=Stansted Airport runway closed after activists stage protest against Home Office deportation flight |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stansted-airport-closed-protesters-deportation-plane-runway-a7655036.html |accessdate=14 December 2018 |work=The Independent |date=28 March 2017}}</ref> 15 of the protestors were found guilty of \"intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome\", under the 1990 [[Aviation and Maritime Security Act]].

There are regular bus service transfers between the Terminal building and Stansted's car parks and hotels.\n\n===Control tower===\n[[File:Stansted Airport - geograph.org.uk - 1761312.jpg|thumb|The Terminal Building with the adjacent Control Tower]]\nStansted's [[air traffic control tower]] was completed in 1996 and was the tallest in Britain at the time of its construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdaconsulting.co.uk/consulting/transport-and-utilities/stansted-airport-control-tower|title=Stansted Airport Control Tower&nbsp;\u2013 MDA Consulting|accessdate=29 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009175913/http://www.mdaconsulting.co.uk/consulting/transport-and-utilities/stansted-airport-control-tower|archivedate=9 October 2011}}</ref> It is located on the southside of the airfield alongside the main terminal building. It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\n\n===Other infrastructure===\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and the [[Boeing 747]]. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport. The largest are located at the south east of the airfield, one of which is used by Ryanair.\n\n[[Titan Airways]] has its head office in the Enterprise House on the airport property.<ref>\"[http://www.titan-airways.com/contact-us.html Contact Us].\" Titan Airways.

This would have been the subject of a public inquiry and, if approved, would have allowed Stansted to handle more passengers than Heathrow did at the time of the application.<ref>{{Cite news | title = \u00a32.5bn Stansted Generation 2 planning bid submitted | publisher = Transport Briefing | date = 12 March 2008 | url = http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4781 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081007053448/http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4781 | archivedate = 7 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2010, BAA withdrew its plans to build a second runway at Stansted and withdrew the plans to build a new runway at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].<ref name=\"withdraw\">BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8701433.stm Heathrow and Stansted runway plans scrapped by BAA], 24 May 2010. Visited 20 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\n\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200&nbsp;million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\n\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] to allow time for BAA and the Government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the General Election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.<ref name=\"withdraw\"/>\n\n====Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE)====\nThe [[advocacy group]] Stop Stansted Expansion (\"SSE\"), formed in 2002 as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport [[White Paper]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100519093443/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; The Future of Air Transport \u2013 White Paper and the Civil Aviation Bill]. Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nIt still actively campaigns against what its members see as the unsustainable expansion of the airport. SSE was a major participant in the 2007 \"G1\" public inquiry and had committed to be a major participant in the anticipated inquiry into the 'G2' second runway proposal. Following the withdrawal of the G2 planning application the group called upon BAA to sell the homes it had bought to support the planned expansion.\n\nIn September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the Government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies,<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission Airports Commission]. GOV.UK. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The Commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election the Commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\n\nThroughout 2013, the Airports Commission published discussion papers and invited submissions from key stakeholders on the main issues it wished to consider. SSE made several thorough submissions. SSE also accepted an invitation to give oral evidence and make a presentation to the Commission on aviation demand forecasting and connectivity at a public evidence session held in Manchester in July 2013.<ref>Stansted Airport Airfield Fire Services 30 March 1998 Emerald Airways HS748 engine exploded on take off whilst carrying the Leeds United football team, aircraft written off but no one injured.

MAG has invested \u00a340&nbsp;million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes to walk through the shopping areas to get to the departure gates.\n\nSatellite One has also been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |title=Transport Secretary Launches \u00a380 Million Terminal Redevelopment |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=London Stansted Airport |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234429/http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===New Arrivals Terminal===\nAn arrivals terminal is planned to be built at Stansted, with construction due to begin in 2018, taking three years to complete. The site will include larger immigration and baggage reclaim areas, with more shops and facilities available after arrival into the UK. The current terminal will be reconfigured to departures only, with security and check-in areas due to be expanded. The project is expected to cost \u00a3130m, and, once completed, will make London Stansted the only airport in the UK with dedicated arrivals and departures terminal buildings.<ref>{{Cite

His initial work was on the largest car, designated XC9001, with the smallest car, XC9003, having the lowest priority despite it being Issigonis' greatest personal interest. With Lord's dictum to produce a bubble car competitor and his revised design requirements being laid down in October 1956, work on XC9001 stopped and XC9003 became the priority. The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small; in addition to Issigonis,  Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on the Morris Minor), Chris Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students, and four draughtsmen worked on the project. Together, by July 1957, they had designed and built the original XC9003 prototype, which was affectionately named the  \"Orange Box\" because of its colour.<ref name=\"reed1\"/> Leonard Lord approved the car for production on 19 July and XC9003 became project [[Amalgamated Drawing Office|ADO15]].\n\nThe ADO15 used a conventional [[BMC A-Series engine|BMC A-Series]] [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder]], [[water-cooled]] engine,<ref name=\"ado15\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |title=Engines of the ADO15 and family |publisher=Mgcars.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190240/http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}</ref> but departed from tradition by mounting it [[Transverse engine|transversely]], with the engine oil-lubricated, four-speed transmission in the [[sump]], and by employing [[front-wheel drive]]. Almost all small front-wheel drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct entry of rainwater through the grille. Early prototypes used the existing 948-cc A-Series unit, but this provided the ADO15 with performance far greater than its price and purpose required \u2013 a top speed  over 90&nbsp;mph. The engine was reduced to a new 848-cc capacity with a shorter [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]]. This reduced power from 37 to 33&nbsp;bhp and caused a significant drop in [[torque]], so provided more realistic performance, especially when the ADO15 body was widened by 2 inches (5.08&nbsp;cm) over the XC9003 prototype, which blunted the car's top speed while improving its stability and roadholding. Even so, the ADO15 had a top speed of 75&nbsp;mph, which was better than many other [[economy car]]s of the time.\n\nThe [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, designed by Issigonis's friend Dr. [[Alex Moulton]] at [[Moulton Developments Limited]], used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels' positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini [[go kart]]-like handling.\n\n[[File:Mini-ature_Parking_Space_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1169507.jpg|thumb|right|The Mini became an icon of 1960s [[British popular culture]], and featured in the 1969 caper film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.]]\nInitially, an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the mechanically interconnected [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--Again this apocryphal \"interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s\"! Which issue? Who was the interviewer? Some credibility, please! -->  which inspired the design of the hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini's launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the [[hydrolastic]] system was first used on the [[Morris 1100]], launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964. As launched, the Mini had simpler suspension made from [[cone|conical]] springs of solid rubber. These were compact, saving on intrusion into the cabin space, and required no maintenance. The fully independent suspension the rubber cones provided was almost unheard of in low-cost cars of the time. The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action, becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression. This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps, but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces. It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car (about 600&nbsp;kg or 1300&nbsp;lb) and a fully laden one (just over 1000&nbsp;kg or 2240&nbsp;lb, or a 70% increase).\n\nTen-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, {{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels (even though he had already settled on 10-inch). An agreement was made on the 10-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.\n\nMany features were designed into the ADO15's interior to maximise its passenger and luggage space on top of the major savings allowed by the transverse engine and 10-inch wheels. Sliding windows allowed single-skin doors to be fitted, improving elbow room and reducing costs. A bracing bar was fitted across the door frame to brace the single skin and this was later adapted into a large storage bin on each door. Issigonis later said that he had sized the bins to carry the ingredients of his favourite drink, a [[Martini (cocktail)|dry martini]] in the correct proportions (one bottle of [[vermouth]] and 27 of [[Gordon's Gin]]<ref name=\"issigbio\"/>). Similar bins were provided outboard of the rear seats, also serving a dual function of bracing the single-skin body panel. Small items could also be stowed under the rear seats, and early Minis were sold with optional [[wicker]] baskets specially shaped to slot under the seats. The fixed rear parcel shelf contributed to the rigidity of the body shell, although it did preclude fitting the ADO15 with a [[hatchback]]. The [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid was hinged at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars, the [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.\n\nThe Mini was designed as a [[monocoque]] shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the [[A-pillar|A and C pillars]], and between the body and the floor pan. Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally. This also saved a small amount of cabin space. It also made the ADO15 very easy to assemble from complete [[knock-down kit]]s in overseas markets with only basic industry. Cars could be assembled with minimal use of [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] as the external seams made the panels largely 'self-aligning'. They also allowed panels to be stacked flat on top of one other for easy shipping. As originally built, all the structural body panels were welded to the top of the single floor pressing, but this caused major problems with water entering the cabin and was quickly changed in the first months of production.\n\nEarly prototypes were fully unitary in construction, but the cars broke apart under the high loads from the large lever ratios used with the rubber cone suspension. The design was changed to use steel subframes to carry the drivetrain and suspension for the front and rear. This also simplified production, as both subframes could be built up independently and then mated to the already-completed bodyshell. It also opened up the possibility of easily producing variants on the ADO15 as a body of any shape or design could be used provided it could accommodate the subframes.\n\nIn 1959, BMC and Alec Issigonis won the [[Dewar Trophy]], for the design and production of the Mini.\n\nThe Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, [[Rover Group]]&nbsp;\u2013 the heirs to BMC&nbsp;\u2013 were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |title=Trade Mark & Copyright Attorneys in Ashby-de-la-Zouch |publisher=Verymark.info |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805192734/http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark I Mini: 1959\u20131967==\n{{See also|Mini (Mark I)}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini \"Mark I\"\n| image      = File:1959 Morris Mini-Minor Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg\n| caption    = 1959 Morris Mini Minor\n| aka        = Austin 850 <br/>Austin Mini <br> Austin Partner<ref>[http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/articles/modelrange.htm#austin Mini Model Range 1959-2001- Austin, www.minipassionmini.50megs.com] Retrieved 11 August 2016</ref> <br />Austin Seven <br> Innocenti Mini<ref name=minimania>[http://www.minimania.com/Mini_Identification_1807 ''Italian Minis''], Minimania.com, Retrieved 12 August 2015</ref> <br /> Morris 850 <br/> Morris Mini <br/> Riley Elf <br /> Wolseley Hornet\n| production = 1959\u20131967\n| assembly   = England <br /> Australia\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] <br /> 2-door [[Station wagon|estate]] <br /> 2-door [[Panel van|van]] <br /> 2-door [[Pickup truck|pickup]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|1071|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br />  {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = [[Alec Issigonis|Sir Alec Issigonis]]\n}}\nThe production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August, several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales.<ref name=\"autocar59\">{{cite journal |title=Happy Events (Editorial) |journal=The Autocar |year=1959 |issue=3315 |page=45}}</ref> The Mini was officially announced to the public on 26 August 1959.

This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known, and successful car that continued in production, and ''minor'' is [[Latin]] for \"lesser\", so an abbreviation of the Latin word for \"least\"&nbsp;\u2013 ''minimus''&nbsp;\u2013 was used for the new even smaller car. One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material&nbsp;\u2013 with the '7' using the letter V rotated anticlockwise so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small [[Austin 7]] of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nUntil 1962, the cars appeared in North America and France as the Austin 850 and Morris 850, and in Denmark as the Austin Partner (until 1964) and Morris Mascot (until 1981). It was introduced in Australia as Morris 850 only (not \"Austin\"), and then later as Morris Cooper and Morris Cooper S versions, as well.  The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin's version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/mini_brochures.htm |title=mini_brochures |publisher=Mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> somewhat to the surprise of the [[Sharp's Commercials]] car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name [[Bond Minicar|Minicar]] for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949.

The new suspension gave a softer ride, but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.\n\nFrom October 1965, the option of the unique [[Automotive Products]] designed four-speed [[AP automatic transmission|automatic transmission]] became available.

The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows, although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from hydrolastic to rubber cones<ref name=Autocar1976/> as a cost-saving measure.<ref name=\"mrtb5\">{{cite book | title=Mini Gold Portfolio 1981\u20131997 | isbn=1-85520-385-5 }}</ref>  (The 1275 GT and Clubman retained the hydrolastic system until June 1971, when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.<ref name=Autocar1976/>)\n\nIn 1969, the simple name Mini completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 |title=Mini\u2013mk III (1969\u20132000) history, pictures |publisher=Histomobile.com |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153350/http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1974, a heater became standard equipment on the entry-level Mini 850, as well, having by then already been included in the standard specification of the other models for some time.<ref name=Autocar1976/>\n\nIn the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the [[Innocenti Mini|Innocenti 90 and 120]], [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]-designed hatchbacks based on the Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the [[Innocenti De Tomaso]], that sported a 1275-cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold, and used the \"A\" clutch instead of the \"Verto\" type. It also used [[Constant-velocity joint|homokinetic shafts]] instead of rubber couplings.\n\nThe Mini was still popular in Britain, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark IV and onwards: 1976\u20132000==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mk IV\n| image      = 1978 Leyland Mini 1000 (8329370970).jpg\n| caption    = 1978 Mini 1000\n| aka        = \n| manufacturer = British Leyland Ltd.\n| production = 1976\u20131983\n| assembly   = {{unbulleted list | [[Longbridge plant]], Birmingham, England | [[Seneffe]], Belgium | [[Petone]], New Zealand | [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal | [[Cape Town]], South Africa | [[Pamplona]], Spain }}\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]<br />2-door van<br />2-door [[Pickup truck|truck]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nThe Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced, all intended to improve the car's mechanical refinement and to reduce noise levels. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included reversing lights.\n\nIn July 1979 the lower end of the Mini range was altered. The basic Mini 850 (which had featured in various forms since the original launch 20 years before) was withdrawn. Its place was taken by two models at slightly lower and slightly higher price points. The new base model was the Mini City, with black-painted bumpers, an untrimmed lower facia rail, part-fabric seats and wing mirror and sun visor only on the driver's side, plus unique 'City' body graphics and boot badge. Above the City was the new 850 SDL (Super Deluxe), which had the same specification as the standard Mini 1000 but with the smaller engine.\n \nFor August 1979 the Mini's 20th anniversary was marked by the introduction of the first true limited-edition Mini, which was the Mini 1100 Special. This was a 5000-car run with the 1098cc engine, broadly to the specification already in production for the European market as a standard model with the same name. However this was the first time a UK-market 'round-nose' (i.e. non-Clubman) Mini had been available with the 1098cc engine, and the UK limited edition was also fitted with unique Exacton alloy wheels - the first time these were fitted to a factory-produced Mini - and plastic wheelarch extensions. Inside was the 1275GT's three-dial instrument cluster and a leather-rimmed wheel with a rectangular centre from the Innocenti Mini hatchback. \n\nThe 1100 Special<ref>http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/pdf/Mini%20Special%201100%20UK%201979.pdf</ref> and 850 City models were phased out by 1980,<ref>https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1979/1705775/mini_850_city.html</ref> and during the same year the engine was upgraded to the improved A-Plus unit from the new Metro. This was then followed by a number of incremental developments.\n\nIn 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new [[Motability]] scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/25/newsid_2500000/2500373.stm | work=BBC News | title=1978: Motability gets moving in the UK | date=25 July 1978}}</ref>\n\nReports of the Mini's imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] (badging with the word \"mini\" in all lowercase). Faced with competition from a new wave of modern superminis like the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Renault 5]], and [[Volkswagen Polo]], the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time. Buyers of small cars now wanted modern and practical designs, usually with a hatchback.\n\nAlthough the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and its successor Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. The original Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars was 1981, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth. The arrival of the Metro also had production of the larger Allegro pruned back before it was finally discontinued in 1982. In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis and over 175,000 Metros. During the early 1980s, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades which were shared with the Metro, such as the [[BMC A-Series engine#A-Plus versions|A-Plus engine]], 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes. The Mini's 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a 'Mini 25' [[List of Mini limited editions#Anniversary editions|limited-edition]] model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini's fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact [[city car]] that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of [[List of Mini limited editions#Colours|limited editions]] with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the [[List of Mini limited editions#London Collection|London Collection]] of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London. These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 in 1985 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. By 1990, with the reintroduction of the very popular Cooper model, Mini production  passed 40,000. In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.\n\n[[File:1992 Mini Cord FA 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|1992 Mini Cord built with a fibreglass body in Venezuela]]\nThe fibreglass [[#Chile|Mini built in Chile]] from 1970 until 1974 was not the only fibreglass version; in the summer of 1991, a fibreglass bodied Mini again entered production, this time in Venezuela.

The end of production in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Variants==\nThe popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.\n\n===Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961\u201369)===\n[[File:Wolseley Hornet Biggleswade.JPG|thumb|Wolseley Hornet]]\n[[File:Riley Elf.jpg|thumb|right|Riley Elf]]\nReleased in 1961 as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] Hornet and the [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more conventional [[Three-box styling|three-box design]].\nThe wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at {{convert|2.036|m|ft|abbr=on}}, whereas the overall length was increased to {{convert|3.27|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This resulted in a dry weight of {{convert|638|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|642.3|kg|abbr=on}} (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and {{convert|618|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|636.4|kg|abbr=on}} for the Hornet.<ref name=\"AKD4062C\">Hornet and Elf Workshop Manual, Part No. AKD 4062C, BMC Service Limited, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>\nFront-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit \"Wolseley\" badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars.<ref>[http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/710/ \"Riley Elf\", ''Motorbase'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.</ref>  The name \"Wolseley Hornet\" was first used on [[Wolseley Hornet six|1930s saloon, coup\u00e9, sports and racing cars]], while the name \"Elf\" recalled the [[Riley Nine|Riley Sprite]] and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name \"Imp\" could not be used as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.\nBoth the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their \"Fisholow\" brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.\nVery early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.\nEarly production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats.<ref name=\"AKD3489\">Body Service Parts List, Riley Elf, Wolseley Hornet, British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, BMC Service division, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>  Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.\n\nBoth the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions. Initially, they used the {{convert|848|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} {{convert|34|bhp|abbr=on}} engine (engine type 8WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor {{convert|38|bhp|abbr=on}} version of the Cooper's {{convert|998|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} power unit (engine type 9WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from {{convert|71|to|77|mph|abbr=on}}. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power in the form of front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. \"magic wand\" type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/> Production of both models ceased in late 1969.\n\nVehicle Identification&nbsp;\u2013 Serial Number Prefix Letter Code:\n* First prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 name: R-Riley, W-Wolseley\n* Second prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 engine type: A\n* Third prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 body type: 2S&nbsp;\u2013 2-door Saloon\n* Fourth prefix&nbsp;\u2013 series of model: 1&nbsp;\u2013 1st series, 2&nbsp;\u2013 2nd series, 3&nbsp;\u2013 3rd series\n* Fifth prefix (used to denote cars different from standard right hand drive): L&nbsp;\u2013 left hand drive\nCode example: R-A2S1-154321 (Riley, A type engine, 2 door saloon, 1st series, serial number \"154321\")<ref name=\"AKD3489\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|Traveller|Countryman}}\n\n===Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960\u201369)===\n[[File:1i i8.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk1 with internal fuel tank]]\n[[File:2 t75.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk2]]\nThese models were two-door estate cars with double \"barn\"-style rear doors.

This is identifiable by the fuel filler cap being on the left hand side of the car just below the rear window.\nIn October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the filler cap was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car \u2013 the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.\n\nFrom the start of production both models had a decorative, non-structural, ash wood trim on the rear body, in the style of a pre-war [[shooting-brake]]. This gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]].  It is a popular misconception that the difference between the Traveller and the Countryman is the wood trim.\nAn all steel version of both the Traveller and the Countryman without the wood trim was launched for export markets in April 1961 and for the home market in October 1962, but the [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] version remained more popular.\n\nIn October 1967 the Mk2 version was launched with the same changes as the saloon.\n\nApproximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymans and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/>  Variations of this model were also built in South Africa, by Innocenti in Italy and by Industria de Montagem de Automoveis in Portugal.\n\nThe Mini Traveller and Countryman Register was created in 2009 to help locate and preserve the remaining Mini Traveller and Countryman cars.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mini Van (1960\u201383){{anchor|Mini_Van}}===\n[[File:Austin Mini Van3222dg.JPG|thumb|right|1963 Austin Mini Van]]\nThe Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a [[sedan delivery]]) rated at \u00bc-ton load capacity.

One thousand units of this version were commissioned by management, intended for and designed to meet the [[homologation]] rules of [[Group A|Group 2]] rally racing. The 997&nbsp;cc engine was replaced by a shorter stroke 998&nbsp;cc unit in 1964. In 1962, Rhodesian John Love became the first non-British racing driver to win the British Saloon Car Championship driving a Mini Cooper.\n[[File:Timo M\u00e4kinen - 1965 Rally Finland (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Timo M\u00e4kinen]] and Mini Cooper S on their way to the first of a [[hat-trick]] of wins in the [[Rally Finland|1000 Lakes Rally]] in Finland]]\nA more powerful Mini Cooper, dubbed the \"S\", was developed in tandem and released in 1963. Featuring a 1071&nbsp;cc engine with a 70.61&nbsp;mm bore and nitrided steel crankshaft and strengthened bottom end to allow further tuning; and larger [[Vacuum servo|servo-assisted]] disc brakes, 4,030 Cooper S cars were produced and sold until the model was updated in August 1964. Cooper also produced two S models specifically for circuit racing in the under 1,000&nbsp;cc and under 1,300&nbsp;cc classes respectively, rated at {{convert|970|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|1275|cc|cuin|abbr=on}}, both had a {{convert|70.61|mm|abbr=on}} bore and both were also offered to the public. The smaller-engine model was not well received, and only 963 had been built when the model was discontinued in 1965. The 1,275&nbsp;cc Cooper S models continued in production until 1971.\n\nSales of the Mini Cooper were as follows: 64,000 Mark I Coopers with 997&nbsp;cc or 998&nbsp;cc engines; 19,000 Mark I Cooper S with 970&nbsp;cc, 1,071&nbsp;cc or 1,275&nbsp;cc engines; 16,000 Mark II Coopers with 998&nbsp;cc engines; 6,300 Mark II Cooper S with 1,275&nbsp;cc engines. There were no Mark III Coopers and just 1,570 Mark III Cooper S.\n\nIn 1971, the Mini Cooper design was licensed in Italy by [[Innocenti]] and in 1973 to Spain by Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Innocenti Mini Cooper 1300 and the Authi Mini Cooper 1300, respectively. The Cooper name was discontinued from the UK Mini range at this time.\n\nA new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990\u201391, with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper. It proved popular and a new Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991. To meet emission standards, Coopers from 1992 on were fitted with a [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the 1,275&nbsp;cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety improvements.<ref name=\"parnell2\">{{cite book |last=Parnell| first=John |title=Original Mini-Cooper: The Restorers Guide To All MKL, II, And III Models |isbn=1-870979-32-X | year=1993 |publisher=Bay View}}</ref> \"I love my Mini Cooper,\" remarked [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2003. \"I was too scared to drive a big car in London.\"<ref>Rees, Paul: 'Listen very carefully, I will say this only once', ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', May 2003, pp 84\u201392</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n{{Anchor|Mini Clubman|Mini 1275GT}}\n\n=={{anchor|Clubman}}Mini Clubman and 1275 GT: 1969\u20131980==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini Clubman <br /> Mini 1275 GT\n| image      = Mini Clubman 1980.JPG\n| caption    = 1980 Mini Clubman\n| aka        = \n| production = 1969\u20131980\n| assembly   = [[Longbridge]], Birmingham, England<br />[[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal<br /> [[Petone]], New Zealand\n| body_style = 2-door saloon <br /> 2-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| engine     = {{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]] <br /> {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nIn 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist [[Roy Haynes (designer)|Roy Haynes]], who had previously worked for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the [[Austin Maxi]]. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. A new model, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller. The original \"round-front\" design remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT.\n\n[[File:Mini Clubman Estate (12769772824).jpg|thumb|left|Mini Clubman Estate|230x230px]]\nProduction of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated \"lots of production changes\" including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer's [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] plant to the [[Longbridge plant]]: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.<ref name=\"Autocar197102\">{{cite journal| first=Geoffrey |last=Howard| title = 10,000 mile (0 km) long-term report: Mini Clubman Estate| journal=Autocar | volume = 134 | issue = 3907| pages = 22\u201323 |date = 11 February 1971}}</ref>\n\nEarly domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 [[Radial tire|radials]] had become the norm for the car's mainstream competitors.<ref name=Autocar197102/>  By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of \u00a38.<ref name=\"Autocar197304\">{{cite journal| title = Auto Test Mini 850| journal=Autocar | volume = 138 | issue = 4012 | pages = 8\u201312 |date = 19 April 1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mini 1275 GT, front.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 1275 GT|229x229px]]\nThe 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the \"Mini Clubman 1275 GT\". The official name was always just the \"Mini 1275 GT\", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).\n\nIn 1971, the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275 GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a [[tachometer]]. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10 inch (25.4&nbsp;cm) Rostyle wheels covering the 7.5inch (19.05&nbsp;cm) Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board, both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0\u2013{{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a {{convert|30|\u2013|50|mph|abbr=on}} time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 \"round-front\" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models. The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original \"round-front\" Mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Leyland Mini LS.jpg|thumb|right|The Leyland Mini LS was produced by [[Leyland Australia]] from 1977 to 1978]]\nFor the Australian market, all Minis including the Van gained the Clubman front in 1971 although the car was still basically a Mk I behind the A-Pillar.<ref name=miniexperience19>[http://miniexperience.com.au/issue-19/history-of-the-clubman-gt.html History of the Clubman GT] Retrieved from miniexperience.com.au on 11 February 2010</ref> The Australian van thus became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world.<ref name=miniexperience19 /> From mid-1971 to the end of 1972, a Clubman GT version of the saloon was produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230190829/http://www.clubmangt.com.au/|title=The GT Spot|date=30 December 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>  This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carburettor Cooper S 1,275&nbsp;cc engine. Australian Clubman saloons were marketed under the '''Morris Mini Clubman''' name when introduced in August 1971,<ref>Green Book Price & Model Guide, July\u2013August 1983, page 71</ref> and as the '''Leyland Mini''', without the Clubman name, from February 1973.<ref name=Green_P60/>\n\nTo end Mini production in Australia, a limited edition runout model was produced \u2212 the 1275LS. Fitted with a pollution control 1,275&nbsp;cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} carburettor and {{convert|8.4|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 810 vehicles produced.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==End of production==\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous \"special editions\" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for [[BMW]], which later bought the remnants of BMC as the [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]]. It was even more popular in Japan, which took the lion's share of the circa 40,000 Minis produced annually in the early 1990s.<ref name=Facorca/> It was seen there as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The [[E.R.A. Mini Turbo|ERA Mini Turbo]] was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.\n\nIn 1994, under [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], a [[first cousin once removed]] of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an [[airbag]] to comply with European legislation.\n\n[[File:2000 Mini Cooper (X411 JOP) 1.3.jpg|thumb|left|The last Mini produced, a Rover Cooper Mini Sport, rolled off the Longbridge line on 4 October 2000]]\nBy March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. [[MG (car)|MG]] and Rover went to [[Phoenix Venture Holdings|Phoenix]], a new British consortium; and [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company]]. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and\u2014for overseas European markets\u2014the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year.<ref name=\"reed1\"/>  A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6 million of which were sold in Britain, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini's demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini's production life.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n\nAfter the last of the Mini production had been sold, the 'Mini' name passed to BMW ownership. [[Mini Hatch]], the new model made by BMW, is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and \"bulldog\" stance of the original.\n\nThe last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant. The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels. This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for \u00a31400.<ref name=\"Mini-2013\">{{cite news | title = Final Longbridge factory Mini sold at auction | date = 28 July 2013 | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23482725 | work = BBC News Online | accessdate = 28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brighton seafront carshow.jpg|thumb|Minis lined up on [[Brighton]] seafront after a [[London to Brighton events|London-to-Brighton rally]] ]]\n\n==Timeline==\n* August 1959: Introduction of the Austin Seven, Morris Mini-Minor and Morris Mini-Minor DL 2-door saloons, all with transversely mounted 848&nbsp;cc engine and 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox.\n* 1960: Introduction of the Austin Seven Countryman and Morris Mini-Minor Traveller 3-door estates, both with 848&nbsp;cc engine from the saloon models. 116,667 cars built in the first full year of production.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Seven Super and Morris Mini-Minor Super 2-door saloons.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper 2-door saloon, both with larger 997&nbsp;cc {{convert|55|bhp|abbr=on}} engine.\n* October 1961: Introduction of Riley Elf and Wolseley Hornet variants<ref name=elf-hornet-register>[http://www.elf-hornet-register.co.uk/Timeline.html Timeline of the Mini (ADO15) Elf/Hornet variant], Elf-hornet-register.co.uk Retrieved 15 February 2016</ref>\n* January 1962: All former Austin Seven models now officially called Austin Mini.\n* March 1962: pvc seat covers replaced cloth upholstery on entry level model (\"basic Mini\").<ref name=\"Autocar1971\">{{cite journal| journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 134 | issue = 3908 |title =Used Car Test: 1968 Morris Mini Mk I de luxe | pages = 51\u201353| date = 18 February 1971}}</ref>\n* 1962: \"De Luxe\" and \"Super\" designations discontinued.  \"Super de Luxe\" designation introduced.

These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100 Special, Mini 1000 Special HL (only available in silver colour with black vinyl roof, black cloth upholstery seats with head restraints and walnut interior trim, for Portugal market only), Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Flame, Mini Red Hot, Mini Jet Black, Mini Racing, Mini Thirty (30) which 3000 examples were produced, 2000 in Red and 1000 in Black and the Mini Monza. There was also a version inspired by ''[[The Italian Job]]'', a 1969 film famous for having a trio of Minis in its epic closing car chase.\n\n==Concepts and unproduced prototypes==\n{{see also|Mini concept cars}}\n[[File:1969 Mini 9X prototype Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 9X at the [[Heritage Motor Centre]]]]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X.<ref name=\"issigbio\"/> It was longer and more powerful than the Mini, but due to politicking inside [[British Leyland]] (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company [[British Motor Holdings]] and the [[Leyland Motor Corporation]]), the car did not reach production.\n\nA number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] museum at [[Gaydon]], Warwickshire. These included the Twini, a re-engineered [[four-wheel-drive]] Moke with two engines\u2014one at the front and another at the back; the [[Austin Ant]], a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a [[transfer case]]; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the [[MG Midget]].\n\nIn 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. Codenamed ''Minki'' (\"Mini\" plus [[Rover K engine|K-Series]] engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|rear door or tailgate]] instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, [[Hydragas]] suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox.<ref name=\"am-minki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |title=Austin Memories: Minki |work=www.austinmemories.com |accessdate=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209025952/http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 }}</ref> However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.\n\nIn 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was commissioned.<ref name=\"am-minki\"/> This resulted in the ''Minki-II'', designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki's tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from a [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]]. The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the [[Mini Hatch]].\n\n==Kit cars and customisation==\n{{Main|List of Mini-based cars}}\n[[File:Outspan Orange.jpg|thumb|right|One of three {{ill|Outspan (brand)|lt=Outspan Orange|fr|Outspan}} Minis, on Madeira Drive in Brighton]]\nThe cheapness and availability of used Minis make it a candidate for body replacement.

This department played a key role in ensuring the Mini's huge success in motorsport throughout the 1960s, in particular, winning the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in 1965, 1966 and 1967, and dominating all of the first 9 positions in the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] at Bathurst.\n\nThe car also won the [[1961 British Saloon Car Championship season|1961]], [[1962 British Saloon Car Championship season|1962]], [[1969 British Saloon Car Championship season|1969]], [[1978 British Saloon Car Championship season|1978]] and [[1979 British Saloon Car Championship season]], as well as the [[British Rally Championship]] in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the [[European Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966, and won the [[Finnish Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallism.fi/content/en/1/171318/Winners+of+FRC.html|title=Winners of FRC|author=|date=|website=Ralli SM}}</ref> Minis also won the [[1965 Lowood 4 Hour]] endurance race, and the final [[Finnish Grand Prix]] in 1963. The Cooper S also had some success in the [[European Touring Car Championship]], winning in 1964 and 1968, the [[Guia Race of Macau]] (a 1-2-3 finish in 1965, a 1\u20132 finish in 1970 and a win in 1972), and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning its class in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. A further title was the 1971 [[Sun-7 Chesterfield Series]].

Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the US importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market. The America was also withdrawn in 1972 due to slow sales and the introduction of bumper-height standards. Mini sales continued in Canada until 1980. MkIII variants, as with their UK counterparts remained badged as a \"Mini\" (no distinction between Austin or Morris), and in 1976 with the takeover of British Leyland, became British Leyland Minis (MkIV).

Together, by July 1957, they had designed and built the original XC9003 prototype, which was affectionately named the  \"Orange Box\" because of its colour.<ref name=\"reed1\"/> Leonard Lord approved the car for production on 19 July and XC9003 became project [[Amalgamated Drawing Office|ADO15]].\n\nThe ADO15 used a conventional [[BMC A-Series engine|BMC A-Series]] [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder]], [[water-cooled]] engine,<ref name=\"ado15\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |title=Engines of the ADO15 and family |publisher=Mgcars.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190240/http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}</ref> but departed from tradition by mounting it [[Transverse engine|transversely]], with the engine oil-lubricated, four-speed transmission in the [[sump]], and by employing [[front-wheel drive]]. Almost all small front-wheel drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct entry of rainwater through the grille. Early prototypes used the existing 948-cc A-Series unit, but this provided the ADO15 with performance far greater than its price and purpose required \u2013 a top speed  over 90&nbsp;mph. The engine was reduced to a new 848-cc capacity with a shorter [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]]. This reduced power from 37 to 33&nbsp;bhp and caused a significant drop in [[torque]], so provided more realistic performance, especially when the ADO15 body was widened by 2 inches (5.08&nbsp;cm) over the XC9003 prototype, which blunted the car's top speed while improving its stability and roadholding. Even so, the ADO15 had a top speed of 75&nbsp;mph, which was better than many other [[economy car]]s of the time.\n\nThe [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, designed by Issigonis's friend Dr. [[Alex Moulton]] at [[Moulton Developments Limited]], used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels' positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini [[go kart]]-like handling.\n\n[[File:Mini-ature_Parking_Space_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1169507.jpg|thumb|right|The Mini became an icon of 1960s [[British popular culture]], and featured in the 1969 caper film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.]]\nInitially, an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the mechanically interconnected [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--Again this apocryphal \"interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s\"! Which issue? Who was the interviewer? Some credibility, please! -->  which inspired the design of the hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini's launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the [[hydrolastic]] system was first used on the [[Morris 1100]], launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964. As launched, the Mini had simpler suspension made from [[cone|conical]] springs of solid rubber. These were compact, saving on intrusion into the cabin space, and required no maintenance. The fully independent suspension the rubber cones provided was almost unheard of in low-cost cars of the time. The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action, becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression. This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps, but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces. It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car (about 600&nbsp;kg or 1300&nbsp;lb) and a fully laden one (just over 1000&nbsp;kg or 2240&nbsp;lb, or a 70% increase).\n\nTen-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, {{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels (even though he had already settled on 10-inch). An agreement was made on the 10-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.\n\nMany features were designed into the ADO15's interior to maximise its passenger and luggage space on top of the major savings allowed by the transverse engine and 10-inch wheels. Sliding windows allowed single-skin doors to be fitted, improving elbow room and reducing costs. A bracing bar was fitted across the door frame to brace the single skin and this was later adapted into a large storage bin on each door. Issigonis later said that he had sized the bins to carry the ingredients of his favourite drink, a [[Martini (cocktail)|dry martini]] in the correct proportions (one bottle of [[vermouth]] and 27 of [[Gordon's Gin]]<ref name=\"issigbio\"/>). Similar bins were provided outboard of the rear seats, also serving a dual function of bracing the single-skin body panel. Small items could also be stowed under the rear seats, and early Minis were sold with optional [[wicker]] baskets specially shaped to slot under the seats. The fixed rear parcel shelf contributed to the rigidity of the body shell, although it did preclude fitting the ADO15 with a [[hatchback]]. The [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid was hinged at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars, the [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.\n\nThe Mini was designed as a [[monocoque]] shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the [[A-pillar|A and C pillars]], and between the body and the floor pan. Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally. This also saved a small amount of cabin space. It also made the ADO15 very easy to assemble from complete [[knock-down kit]]s in overseas markets with only basic industry. Cars could be assembled with minimal use of [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] as the external seams made the panels largely 'self-aligning'. They also allowed panels to be stacked flat on top of one other for easy shipping. As originally built, all the structural body panels were welded to the top of the single floor pressing, but this caused major problems with water entering the cabin and was quickly changed in the first months of production.\n\nEarly prototypes were fully unitary in construction, but the cars broke apart under the high loads from the large lever ratios used with the rubber cone suspension. The design was changed to use steel subframes to carry the drivetrain and suspension for the front and rear. This also simplified production, as both subframes could be built up independently and then mated to the already-completed bodyshell. It also opened up the possibility of easily producing variants on the ADO15 as a body of any shape or design could be used provided it could accommodate the subframes.\n\nIn 1959, BMC and Alec Issigonis won the [[Dewar Trophy]], for the design and production of the Mini.\n\nThe Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, [[Rover Group]]&nbsp;\u2013 the heirs to BMC&nbsp;\u2013 were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |title=Trade Mark & Copyright Attorneys in Ashby-de-la-Zouch |publisher=Verymark.info |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805192734/http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark I Mini: 1959\u20131967==\n{{See also|Mini (Mark I)}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini \"Mark I\"\n| image      = File:1959 Morris Mini-Minor Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg\n| caption    = 1959 Morris Mini Minor\n| aka        = Austin 850 <br/>Austin Mini <br> Austin Partner<ref>[http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/articles/modelrange.htm#austin Mini Model Range 1959-2001- Austin, www.minipassionmini.50megs.com] Retrieved 11 August 2016</ref> <br />Austin Seven <br> Innocenti Mini<ref name=minimania>[http://www.minimania.com/Mini_Identification_1807 ''Italian Minis''], Minimania.com, Retrieved 12 August 2015</ref> <br /> Morris 850 <br/> Morris Mini <br/> Riley Elf <br /> Wolseley Hornet\n| production = 1959\u20131967\n| assembly   = England <br /> Australia\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] <br /> 2-door [[Station wagon|estate]] <br /> 2-door [[Panel van|van]] <br /> 2-door [[Pickup truck|pickup]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|1071|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br />  {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = [[Alec Issigonis|Sir Alec Issigonis]]\n}}\nThe production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August, several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales.<ref name=\"autocar59\">{{cite journal |title=Happy Events (Editorial) |journal=The Autocar |year=1959 |issue=3315 |page=45}}</ref> The Mini was officially announced to the public on 26 August 1959.

This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known, and successful car that continued in production, and ''minor'' is [[Latin]] for \"lesser\", so an abbreviation of the Latin word for \"least\"&nbsp;\u2013 ''minimus''&nbsp;\u2013 was used for the new even smaller car. One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material&nbsp;\u2013 with the '7' using the letter V rotated anticlockwise so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small [[Austin 7]] of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nUntil 1962, the cars appeared in North America and France as the Austin 850 and Morris 850, and in Denmark as the Austin Partner (until 1964) and Morris Mascot (until 1981). It was introduced in Australia as Morris 850 only (not \"Austin\"), and then later as Morris Cooper and Morris Cooper S versions, as well.  The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin's version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/mini_brochures.htm |title=mini_brochures |publisher=Mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> somewhat to the surprise of the [[Sharp's Commercials]] car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name [[Bond Minicar|Minicar]] for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949.

The new suspension gave a softer ride, but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.\n\nFrom October 1965, the option of the unique [[Automotive Products]] designed four-speed [[AP automatic transmission|automatic transmission]] became available. Cars fitted with this became the Mini-Matic.\n\nSlow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000.<ref name=\"sales\"/> [[Ford]] purchased a Mini and dismantled it to see if they could offer an alternative.

The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges.

Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the [[Innocenti De Tomaso]], that sported a 1275-cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold, and used the \"A\" clutch instead of the \"Verto\" type. It also used [[Constant-velocity joint|homokinetic shafts]] instead of rubber couplings.\n\nThe Mini was still popular in Britain, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark IV and onwards: 1976\u20132000==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mk IV\n| image      = 1978 Leyland Mini 1000 (8329370970).jpg\n| caption    = 1978 Mini 1000\n| aka        = \n| manufacturer = British Leyland Ltd.\n| production = 1976\u20131983\n| assembly   = {{unbulleted list | [[Longbridge plant]], Birmingham, England | [[Seneffe]], Belgium | [[Petone]], New Zealand | [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal | [[Cape Town]], South Africa | [[Pamplona]], Spain }}\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]<br />2-door van<br />2-door [[Pickup truck|truck]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nThe Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced, all intended to improve the car's mechanical refinement and to reduce noise levels. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included reversing lights.\n\nIn July 1979 the lower end of the Mini range was altered. The basic Mini 850 (which had featured in various forms since the original launch 20 years before) was withdrawn. Its place was taken by two models at slightly lower and slightly higher price points. The new base model was the Mini City, with black-painted bumpers, an untrimmed lower facia rail, part-fabric seats and wing mirror and sun visor only on the driver's side, plus unique 'City' body graphics and boot badge. Above the City was the new 850 SDL (Super Deluxe), which had the same specification as the standard Mini 1000 but with the smaller engine.\n \nFor August 1979 the Mini's 20th anniversary was marked by the introduction of the first true limited-edition Mini, which was the Mini 1100 Special. This was a 5000-car run with the 1098cc engine, broadly to the specification already in production for the European market as a standard model with the same name. However this was the first time a UK-market 'round-nose' (i.e. non-Clubman) Mini had been available with the 1098cc engine, and the UK limited edition was also fitted with unique Exacton alloy wheels - the first time these were fitted to a factory-produced Mini - and plastic wheelarch extensions. Inside was the 1275GT's three-dial instrument cluster and a leather-rimmed wheel with a rectangular centre from the Innocenti Mini hatchback. \n\nThe 1100 Special<ref>http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/pdf/Mini%20Special%201100%20UK%201979.pdf</ref> and 850 City models were phased out by 1980,<ref>https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1979/1705775/mini_850_city.html</ref> and during the same year the engine was upgraded to the improved A-Plus unit from the new Metro. This was then followed by a number of incremental developments.\n\nIn 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new [[Motability]] scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/25/newsid_2500000/2500373.stm | work=BBC News | title=1978: Motability gets moving in the UK | date=25 July 1978}}</ref>\n\nReports of the Mini's imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] (badging with the word \"mini\" in all lowercase). Faced with competition from a new wave of modern superminis like the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Renault 5]], and [[Volkswagen Polo]], the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time. Buyers of small cars now wanted modern and practical designs, usually with a hatchback.\n\nAlthough the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and its successor Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. The original Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars was 1981, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth. The arrival of the Metro also had production of the larger Allegro pruned back before it was finally discontinued in 1982. In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis and over 175,000 Metros. During the early 1980s, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades which were shared with the Metro, such as the [[BMC A-Series engine#A-Plus versions|A-Plus engine]], 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes. The Mini's 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a 'Mini 25' [[List of Mini limited editions#Anniversary editions|limited-edition]] model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini's fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact [[city car]] that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of [[List of Mini limited editions#Colours|limited editions]] with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the [[List of Mini limited editions#London Collection|London Collection]] of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London. These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 in 1985 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. By 1990, with the reintroduction of the very popular Cooper model, Mini production  passed 40,000. In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.\n\n[[File:1992 Mini Cord FA 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|1992 Mini Cord built with a fibreglass body in Venezuela]]\nThe fibreglass [[#Chile|Mini built in Chile]] from 1970 until 1974 was not the only fibreglass version; in the summer of 1991, a fibreglass bodied Mini again entered production, this time in Venezuela.

The Mini Cooper was relaunched in 1989, 20 years after the demise of the original model. Once again, it featured the long-running 1275-cc engine which had featured on the original Mini Cooper, as well as on numerous other BMC/BL/ARG models.\n\n===Mark VI: 1990\u20131996===\nThe engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275-cc power units, and includes the later Horizontal Integral Float version of the [[SU carburettor|SU carb]], plus the single-point fuel-injected car, which came out in 1991.

The end of production in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Variants==\nThe popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.\n\n===Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961\u201369)===\n[[File:Wolseley Hornet Biggleswade.JPG|thumb|Wolseley Hornet]]\n[[File:Riley Elf.jpg|thumb|right|Riley Elf]]\nReleased in 1961 as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] Hornet and the [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more conventional [[Three-box styling|three-box design]].\nThe wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at {{convert|2.036|m|ft|abbr=on}}, whereas the overall length was increased to {{convert|3.27|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This resulted in a dry weight of {{convert|638|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|642.3|kg|abbr=on}} (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and {{convert|618|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|636.4|kg|abbr=on}} for the Hornet.<ref name=\"AKD4062C\">Hornet and Elf Workshop Manual, Part No. AKD 4062C, BMC Service Limited, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>\nFront-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit \"Wolseley\" badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars.<ref>[http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/710/ \"Riley Elf\", ''Motorbase'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.</ref>  The name \"Wolseley Hornet\" was first used on [[Wolseley Hornet six|1930s saloon, coup\u00e9, sports and racing cars]], while the name \"Elf\" recalled the [[Riley Nine|Riley Sprite]] and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name \"Imp\" could not be used as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.\nBoth the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their \"Fisholow\" brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.\nVery early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.\nEarly production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats.<ref name=\"AKD3489\">Body Service Parts List, Riley Elf, Wolseley Hornet, British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, BMC Service division, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>  Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.\n\nBoth the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions. Initially, they used the {{convert|848|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} {{convert|34|bhp|abbr=on}} engine (engine type 8WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor {{convert|38|bhp|abbr=on}} version of the Cooper's {{convert|998|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} power unit (engine type 9WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from {{convert|71|to|77|mph|abbr=on}}. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power in the form of front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. \"magic wand\" type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/> Production of both models ceased in late 1969.\n\nVehicle Identification&nbsp;\u2013 Serial Number Prefix Letter Code:\n* First prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 name: R-Riley, W-Wolseley\n* Second prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 engine type: A\n* Third prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 body type: 2S&nbsp;\u2013 2-door Saloon\n* Fourth prefix&nbsp;\u2013 series of model: 1&nbsp;\u2013 1st series, 2&nbsp;\u2013 2nd series, 3&nbsp;\u2013 3rd series\n* Fifth prefix (used to denote cars different from standard right hand drive): L&nbsp;\u2013 left hand drive\nCode example: R-A2S1-154321 (Riley, A type engine, 2 door saloon, 1st series, serial number \"154321\")<ref name=\"AKD3489\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|Traveller|Countryman}}\n\n===Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960\u201369)===\n[[File:1i i8.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk1 with internal fuel tank]]\n[[File:2 t75.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk2]]\nThese models were two-door estate cars with double \"barn\"-style rear doors. Both were built on a slightly longer chassis of {{convert|84|in|m}} compared to {{convert|80.25|in|m}} for the saloon.\n\nThe early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman cars had an internal fuel tank located on the left hand side of the rear load area.  This is identifiable by the fuel filler cap being on the left hand side of the car just below the rear window.\nIn October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the filler cap was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car \u2013 the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.\n\nFrom the start of production both models had a decorative, non-structural, ash wood trim on the rear body, in the style of a pre-war [[shooting-brake]]. This gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]].  It is a popular misconception that the difference between the Traveller and the Countryman is the wood trim.\nAn all steel version of both the Traveller and the Countryman without the wood trim was launched for export markets in April 1961 and for the home market in October 1962, but the [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] version remained more popular.\n\nIn October 1967 the Mk2 version was launched with the same changes as the saloon.\n\nApproximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymans and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/>  Variations of this model were also built in South Africa, by Innocenti in Italy and by Industria de Montagem de Automoveis in Portugal.\n\nThe Mini Traveller and Countryman Register was created in 2009 to help locate and preserve the remaining Mini Traveller and Countryman cars.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mini Van (1960\u201383){{anchor|Mini_Van}}===\n[[File:Austin Mini Van3222dg.JPG|thumb|right|1963 Austin Mini Van]]\nThe Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a [[sedan delivery]]) rated at \u00bc-ton load capacity. Built on the longer Traveller chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in 1960s Britain as a cheaper alternative to the car: it was classed as a commercial vehicle and as such carried no sales tax. A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille.

The original \"round-front\" design remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT.\n\n[[File:Mini Clubman Estate (12769772824).jpg|thumb|left|Mini Clubman Estate|230x230px]]\nProduction of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated \"lots of production changes\" including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer's [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] plant to the [[Longbridge plant]]: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.<ref name=\"Autocar197102\">{{cite journal| first=Geoffrey |last=Howard| title = 10,000 mile (0 km) long-term report: Mini Clubman Estate| journal=Autocar | volume = 134 | issue = 3907| pages = 22\u201323 |date = 11 February 1971}}</ref>\n\nEarly domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 [[Radial tire|radials]] had become the norm for the car's mainstream competitors.<ref name=Autocar197102/>  By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of \u00a38.<ref name=\"Autocar197304\">{{cite journal| title = Auto Test Mini 850| journal=Autocar | volume = 138 | issue = 4012 | pages = 8\u201312 |date = 19 April 1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mini 1275 GT, front.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 1275 GT|229x229px]]\nThe 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the \"Mini Clubman 1275 GT\". The official name was always just the \"Mini 1275 GT\", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).\n\nIn 1971, the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275 GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a [[tachometer]]. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10 inch (25.4&nbsp;cm) Rostyle wheels covering the 7.5inch (19.05&nbsp;cm) Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board, both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0\u2013{{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a {{convert|30|\u2013|50|mph|abbr=on}} time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 \"round-front\" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models. The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original \"round-front\" Mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Leyland Mini LS.jpg|thumb|right|The Leyland Mini LS was produced by [[Leyland Australia]] from 1977 to 1978]]\nFor the Australian market, all Minis including the Van gained the Clubman front in 1971 although the car was still basically a Mk I behind the A-Pillar.<ref name=miniexperience19>[http://miniexperience.com.au/issue-19/history-of-the-clubman-gt.html History of the Clubman GT] Retrieved from miniexperience.com.au on 11 February 2010</ref> The Australian van thus became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world.<ref name=miniexperience19 /> From mid-1971 to the end of 1972, a Clubman GT version of the saloon was produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230190829/http://www.clubmangt.com.au/|title=The GT Spot|date=30 December 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>  This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carburettor Cooper S 1,275&nbsp;cc engine. Australian Clubman saloons were marketed under the '''Morris Mini Clubman''' name when introduced in August 1971,<ref>Green Book Price & Model Guide, July\u2013August 1983, page 71</ref> and as the '''Leyland Mini''', without the Clubman name, from February 1973.<ref name=Green_P60/>\n\nTo end Mini production in Australia, a limited edition runout model was produced \u2212 the 1275LS. Fitted with a pollution control 1,275&nbsp;cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} carburettor and {{convert|8.4|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 810 vehicles produced.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==End of production==\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous \"special editions\" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for [[BMW]], which later bought the remnants of BMC as the [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]]. It was even more popular in Japan, which took the lion's share of the circa 40,000 Minis produced annually in the early 1990s.<ref name=Facorca/> It was seen there as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The [[E.R.A. Mini Turbo|ERA Mini Turbo]] was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.\n\nIn 1994, under [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], a [[first cousin once removed]] of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an [[airbag]] to comply with European legislation.\n\n[[File:2000 Mini Cooper (X411 JOP) 1.3.jpg|thumb|left|The last Mini produced, a Rover Cooper Mini Sport, rolled off the Longbridge line on 4 October 2000]]\nBy March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. [[MG (car)|MG]] and Rover went to [[Phoenix Venture Holdings|Phoenix]], a new British consortium; and [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company]]. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and\u2014for overseas European markets\u2014the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year.<ref name=\"reed1\"/>  A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6 million of which were sold in Britain, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini's demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini's production life.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n\nAfter the last of the Mini production had been sold, the 'Mini' name passed to BMW ownership. [[Mini Hatch]], the new model made by BMW, is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and \"bulldog\" stance of the original.\n\nThe last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant. The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels. This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for \u00a31400.<ref name=\"Mini-2013\">{{cite news | title = Final Longbridge factory Mini sold at auction | date = 28 July 2013 | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23482725 | work = BBC News Online | accessdate = 28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brighton seafront carshow.jpg|thumb|Minis lined up on [[Brighton]] seafront after a [[London to Brighton events|London-to-Brighton rally]] ]]\n\n==Timeline==\n* August 1959: Introduction of the Austin Seven, Morris Mini-Minor and Morris Mini-Minor DL 2-door saloons, all with transversely mounted 848&nbsp;cc engine and 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox.\n* 1960: Introduction of the Austin Seven Countryman and Morris Mini-Minor Traveller 3-door estates, both with 848&nbsp;cc engine from the saloon models. 116,667 cars built in the first full year of production.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Seven Super and Morris Mini-Minor Super 2-door saloons.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper 2-door saloon, both with larger 997&nbsp;cc {{convert|55|bhp|abbr=on}} engine.\n* October 1961: Introduction of Riley Elf and Wolseley Hornet variants<ref name=elf-hornet-register>[http://www.elf-hornet-register.co.uk/Timeline.html Timeline of the Mini (ADO15) Elf/Hornet variant], Elf-hornet-register.co.uk Retrieved 15 February 2016</ref>\n* January 1962: All former Austin Seven models now officially called Austin Mini.\n* March 1962: pvc seat covers replaced cloth upholstery on entry level model (\"basic Mini\").<ref name=\"Autocar1971\">{{cite journal| journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 134 | issue = 3908 |title =Used Car Test: 1968 Morris Mini Mk I de luxe | pages = 51\u201353| date = 18 February 1971}}</ref>\n* 1962: \"De Luxe\" and \"Super\" designations discontinued.  \"Super de Luxe\" designation introduced.

These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100 Special, Mini 1000 Special HL (only available in silver colour with black vinyl roof, black cloth upholstery seats with head restraints and walnut interior trim, for Portugal market only), Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Flame, Mini Red Hot, Mini Jet Black, Mini Racing, Mini Thirty (30) which 3000 examples were produced, 2000 in Red and 1000 in Black and the Mini Monza. There was also a version inspired by ''[[The Italian Job]]'', a 1969 film famous for having a trio of Minis in its epic closing car chase.\n\n==Concepts and unproduced prototypes==\n{{see also|Mini concept cars}}\n[[File:1969 Mini 9X prototype Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 9X at the [[Heritage Motor Centre]]]]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X.<ref name=\"issigbio\"/> It was longer and more powerful than the Mini, but due to politicking inside [[British Leyland]] (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company [[British Motor Holdings]] and the [[Leyland Motor Corporation]]), the car did not reach production.\n\nA number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] museum at [[Gaydon]], Warwickshire. These included the Twini, a re-engineered [[four-wheel-drive]] Moke with two engines\u2014one at the front and another at the back; the [[Austin Ant]], a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a [[transfer case]]; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the [[MG Midget]].\n\nIn 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. Codenamed ''Minki'' (\"Mini\" plus [[Rover K engine|K-Series]] engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|rear door or tailgate]] instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, [[Hydragas]] suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox.<ref name=\"am-minki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |title=Austin Memories: Minki |work=www.austinmemories.com |accessdate=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209025952/http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 }}</ref> However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.\n\nIn 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was commissioned.<ref name=\"am-minki\"/> This resulted in the ''Minki-II'', designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki's tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from a [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]]. The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the [[Mini Hatch]].\n\n==Kit cars and customisation==\n{{Main|List of Mini-based cars}}\n[[File:Outspan Orange.jpg|thumb|right|One of three {{ill|Outspan (brand)|lt=Outspan Orange|fr|Outspan}} Minis, on Madeira Drive in Brighton]]\nThe cheapness and availability of used Minis make it a candidate for body replacement. [[List of Mini based cars|There are over 120]] Mini-based [[kit car]]s from various small companies and individual enthusiasts.\n\n==Motorsport==\nBMC operated a Competition Department at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], Oxfordshire, under the control of Stuart Turner, which built specially prepared Minis (mostly based on Cooper and Cooper S versions) to compete in international rallies and other motorsport. This department played a key role in ensuring the Mini's huge success in motorsport throughout the 1960s, in particular, winning the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in 1965, 1966 and 1967, and dominating all of the first 9 positions in the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] at Bathurst.\n\nThe car also won the [[1961 British Saloon Car Championship season|1961]], [[1962 British Saloon Car Championship season|1962]], [[1969 British Saloon Car Championship season|1969]], [[1978 British Saloon Car Championship season|1978]] and [[1979 British Saloon Car Championship season]], as well as the [[British Rally Championship]] in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the [[European Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966, and won the [[Finnish Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallism.fi/content/en/1/171318/Winners+of+FRC.html|title=Winners of FRC|author=|date=|website=Ralli SM}}</ref> Minis also won the [[1965 Lowood 4 Hour]] endurance race, and the final [[Finnish Grand Prix]] in 1963. The Cooper S also had some success in the [[European Touring Car Championship]], winning in 1964 and 1968, the [[Guia Race of Macau]] (a 1-2-3 finish in 1965, a 1\u20132 finish in 1970 and a win in 1972), and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning its class in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. A further title was the 1971 [[Sun-7 Chesterfield Series]]. The Mini also achieved class wins at the [[1963 Armstrong 500]], repeating this feat every year until [[1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1969]], and having class wins at the 1964, 1965 and [[1971 Sandown 250]], and [[Six Hour Le Mans]] in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, as well as the [[1971 Phillip Island 500K]]. The car also won the [[Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship]] in 1998. Mini Leyland came 4th place in the under-2-litre category in the [[1966 Trans-Am season|1966]], [[1967 Trans-Am season|1967]] and [[1969 Trans-Am season]]s, improving to 3rd in [[1970 Trans-Am season|1970]].\n\nThe Mini Cooper S won the [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967.<ref name=\"montecarlo\"/> Minis initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges.

Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the US importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market. The America was also withdrawn in 1972 due to slow sales and the introduction of bumper-height standards. Mini sales continued in Canada until 1980. MkIII variants, as with their UK counterparts remained badged as a \"Mini\" (no distinction between Austin or Morris), and in 1976 with the takeover of British Leyland, became British Leyland Minis (MkIV). Leyland Minis also were subject to stricter government regulation with high bumpers, large turn indicators, warning buzzers and lights for seat belts and also a fitting of air pollution pumps which required a specially designed radiator.\n\nToday the U.S. Government exempts cars older than 25 years [[Grey import vehicle#United States|from all import laws]], so older Minis can be freely imported.

It was a comedy version of ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', with [[Anne Francine]] playing wealthy villain Flora Simpson Reilly.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In one episode, Stella dressed in a blue and gold genie costume and in another she played both Stella and her cousin Della Smith (similar to Jeannie's evil twin-sister character). The TV series ''[[Harper Valley PTA (TV series)|Harper Valley PTA]]'' began January 16, 1981, and was renamed simply ''Harper Valley'' when the show began its second season on October 29, 1981.
