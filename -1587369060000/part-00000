It was established on 17 March 1866, making it the fourth high court to be established in [[India]].\n\n==History==\nAllahabad became the seat of Government of [[North-Western Provinces]] and a High Court was established in 1834 but was shifted to [[Agra]] within a year.<ref>[[#Joshi|Joshi]], p. 93</ref> In 1868 it shifted back to Allahabad.<ref>[[#Joshi|Joshi]], p. 122</ref><ref name=TPRC118>[[#Joshi|Joshi]], p. 118</ref> The former High Court was located at the Accountant General's office at the [[University of Allahabad]] complex.<ref name=TPRC118/>\n\nIt was founded as the High Court of Judicature for the North-Western Provinces at Agra on 17 March 1866 by the [[Indian High Courts Act 1861]] replacing the old [[Sadr Diwani Adalat]]. Sir Walter Morgan, [[Barrister-at-Law]] and Mr. Simpson were appointed the first Chief Justice and the first Registrar respectively of the High Court of North-Western Provinces.\n\nThe location High Court for the North-Western Provinces was shifted from Agra to [[Allahabad]] in 1869 and the name was correspondingly changed to the '''High Court of Judicature at Allahabad''' from 11 March 1919.\n\nOn 2 November 1925, the Oudh Judicial Commissioner's Court was replaced by the Oudh Chief Court at [[Lucknow]] by the Oudh Civil Courts Act of 1925, enacted by the United Provinces Legislature with the previous sanction of the [[Governor General of India|Governor General]] the passing of this Act.\n\nOn 25 February 1948, the Chief Court of Oudh was amalgamated with the High Court of Allahabad.\n\nWhen the state of Uttaranchal, now known as [[Uttarakhand]], was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, this high court ceased to have jurisdiction over the districts falling in Uttaranchal.\nAllahabad High court was built by Khan saheb Nizamuddin of Loha Mundi, Agra, India. He also donated the water fountain to the High court.\n\n==Principal seat and benches==\nThe seat of the court is at [[Allahabad|Prayagraj]]. Allahabad High Court maintains a permanent circuit bench at [[Lucknow]], the administrative capital of the state. The maximum number of serving judges is 160, the highest in India.\n\n==Chief Justice==\n[[File:Allahabad High Court 2016 stampsheet of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A 2016 stamp sheet dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the Allahabad High Court]]\nJustice [[Govind Mathur]] is the current Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"bs\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/db-bhosale-takes-over-as-chief-justice-of-allahabad-hc-116073000575_1.html |title=DB Bhosale takes over as Chief Justice of Allahabad HC |date=30 July 2016 |work=[[Business Standard]] |access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===List of Chief Justices===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |#\n! colspan=\"2\" |Chief Justice\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Term Start\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Term End\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Governor (Oathed by)\n|-\n!English\n!Hindi\n|-\n!1\n|[[Walter Morgan (judge)|Walter Morgan]]\n|\u0935\u093e\u0932\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0930 \u092e\u0949\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0928\n|1866\n|1871\n|\n|-\n!2\n| Robert Stuart\n|\u0930\u0949\u092c\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0941\u0905\u0930\u094d\u091f\n|1871\n|1884\n|\n|-\n!3\n| [[William Comer Petheram]]\n|\u0935\u093f\u0932\u093f\u092f\u092e \u0915\u0949\u092e\u0930 \u092a\u0948\u0925\u0930\u093e\u092e\n|1884\n|1886\n|\n|-\n!4\n| [[John Edge]]\n|\u091c\u0949\u0928 \u090f\u091c\n|1886\n|1898\n|\n|-\n!5\n| [[Louis Addin Kershaw]]\n|\u0932\u0941\u0907\u0938 \u090f\u0921\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094c\n|1898\n|\n|\n|-\n!6\n|[[Arthur Strachey]]\n|\u0906\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0947\n|1898\n|1901\n|\n|-\n!7\n| John Stanley\n|\u091c\u0949\u0928 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0928\u0932\u0947\n|1901\n|1911\n|\n|-\n!8\n| Henry George Richards\n|\u0939\u0947\u0928\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u0949\u0930\u094d\u091c \u0930\u093f\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0921\u094d\u0938\n|1911\n|1919\n|\n|-\n!9\n| [[Edward Grimwood Mears]]\n|\u090f\u0921\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0921 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092e\u0935\u0941\u0921 \u092e\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938\n|1919\n|1932\n|\n|-\n!10\n|[[Shah Muhammad Sulaiman]]\n|\u0936\u093e\u0939 \u092e\u0941\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u0938\u0941\u0932\u0947\u092e\u093e\u0928\n|1932\n|1937\n|\n|-\n!11\n| John Gibb Thom\n|\u091c\u0949\u0928 \u0917\u093f\u092c \u0925\u0949\u092e\n|1937\n|1941\n|\n|-\n!12\n| Iqbal Ahmad\n|\u0907\u0915\u093c\u092c\u093e\u0932 \u0905\u0939\u092e\u0926\n|1941\n|1946\n|\n|-\n!13\n| Kamala Kanta Verma\n|\u0915\u092e\u0932 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0924 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\n|1946\n|1947\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |After Independence\n|-\n!14\n| Bidhu Bhushan Malik\n|\u092c\u093f\u0927\u0941 \u092d\u0942\u0937\u0923 \u092e\u0932\u093f\u0915\n|1947\n|1955\n|[[Sarojini Naidu]]\n|-\n!15\n| O.H.

It was established on 17 March 1866, making it the fourth high court to be established in [[India]].\n\n==History==\nAllahabad became the seat of Government of [[North-Western Provinces]] and a High Court was established in 1834 but was shifted to [[Agra]] within a year.<ref>[[#Joshi|Joshi]], p. 93</ref> In 1868 it shifted back to Allahabad.<ref>[[#Joshi|Joshi]], p. 122</ref><ref name=TPRC118>[[#Joshi|Joshi]], p. 118</ref> The former High Court was located at the Accountant General's office at the [[University of Allahabad]] complex.<ref name=TPRC118/>\n\nIt was founded as the High Court of Judicature for the North-Western Provinces at Agra on 17 March 1866 by the [[Indian High Courts Act 1861]] replacing the old [[Sadr Diwani Adalat]]. Sir Walter Morgan, [[Barrister-at-Law]] and Mr. Simpson were appointed the first Chief Justice and the first Registrar respectively of the High Court of North-Western Provinces.\n\nThe location High Court for the North-Western Provinces was shifted from Agra to [[Allahabad]] in 1869 and the name was correspondingly changed to the '''High Court of Judicature at Allahabad''' from 11 March 1919.\n\nOn 2 November 1925, the Oudh Judicial Commissioner's Court was replaced by the Oudh Chief Court at [[Lucknow]] by the Oudh Civil Courts Act of 1925, enacted by the United Provinces Legislature with the previous sanction of the [[Governor General of India|Governor General]] the passing of this Act.\n\nOn 25 February 1948, the Chief Court of Oudh was amalgamated with the High Court of Allahabad.\n\nWhen the state of Uttaranchal, now known as [[Uttarakhand]], was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, this high court ceased to have jurisdiction over the districts falling in Uttaranchal.\nAllahabad High court was built by Khan saheb Nizamuddin of Loha Mundi, Agra, India. He also donated the water fountain to the High court.\n\n==Principal seat and benches==\nThe seat of the court is at [[Allahabad|Prayagraj]]. Allahabad High Court maintains a permanent circuit bench at [[Lucknow]], the administrative capital of the state. The maximum number of serving judges is 160, the highest in India.\n\n==Chief Justice==\n[[File:Allahabad High Court 2016 stampsheet of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A 2016 stamp sheet dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the Allahabad High Court]]\nJustice [[Govind Mathur]] is the current Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"bs\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/db-bhosale-takes-over-as-chief-justice-of-allahabad-hc-116073000575_1.html |title=DB Bhosale takes over as Chief Justice of Allahabad HC |date=30 July 2016 |work=[[Business Standard]] |access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===List of Chief Justices===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |#\n! colspan=\"2\" |Chief Justice\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Term Start\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Term End\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Governor (Oathed by)\n|-\n!English\n!Hindi\n|-\n!1\n|[[Walter Morgan (judge)|Walter Morgan]]\n|\u0935\u093e\u0932\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0930 \u092e\u0949\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0928\n|1866\n|1871\n|\n|-\n!2\n| Robert Stuart\n|\u0930\u0949\u092c\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0941\u0905\u0930\u094d\u091f\n|1871\n|1884\n|\n|-\n!3\n| [[William Comer Petheram]]\n|\u0935\u093f\u0932\u093f\u092f\u092e \u0915\u0949\u092e\u0930 \u092a\u0948\u0925\u0930\u093e\u092e\n|1884\n|1886\n|\n|-\n!4\n| [[John Edge]]\n|\u091c\u0949\u0928 \u090f\u091c\n|1886\n|1898\n|\n|-\n!5\n| [[Louis Addin Kershaw]]\n|\u0932\u0941\u0907\u0938 \u090f\u0921\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u0947\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094c\n|1898\n|\n|\n|-\n!6\n|[[Arthur Strachey]]\n|\u0906\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0947\n|1898\n|1901\n|\n|-\n!7\n| John Stanley\n|\u091c\u0949\u0928 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0928\u0932\u0947\n|1901\n|1911\n|\n|-\n!8\n| Henry George Richards\n|\u0939\u0947\u0928\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u0949\u0930\u094d\u091c \u0930\u093f\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0921\u094d\u0938\n|1911\n|1919\n|\n|-\n!9\n| [[Edward Grimwood Mears]]\n|\u090f\u0921\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0921 \u0917\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092e\u0935\u0941\u0921 \u092e\u0947\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0938\n|1919\n|1932\n|\n|-\n!10\n|[[Shah Muhammad Sulaiman]]\n|\u0936\u093e\u0939 \u092e\u0941\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u0938\u0941\u0932\u0947\u092e\u093e\u0928\n|1932\n|1937\n|\n|-\n!11\n| John Gibb Thom\n|\u091c\u0949\u0928 \u0917\u093f\u092c \u0925\u0949\u092e\n|1937\n|1941\n|\n|-\n!12\n| Iqbal Ahmad\n|\u0907\u0915\u093c\u092c\u093e\u0932 \u0905\u0939\u092e\u0926\n|1941\n|1946\n|\n|-\n!13\n| Kamala Kanta Verma\n|\u0915\u092e\u0932 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0924 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\n|1946\n|1947\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |After Independence\n|-\n!14\n| Bidhu Bhushan Malik\n|\u092c\u093f\u0927\u0941 \u092d\u0942\u0937\u0923 \u092e\u0932\u093f\u0915\n|1947\n|1955\n|[[Sarojini Naidu]]\n|-\n!15\n| O.H.

Much to the disdain of Yankovic, this includes songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive.

Subject headings from the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress]] fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort to keep up with these changes and try to bring \"structure and order\" to the task of helping users find information.<ref name=tws2NovY312 />\n\n==Benefits of authority control==\n* ''Better researching''. Authority control helps researchers get a handle on a specific subject with less wasted effort.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> A well-designed digital catalog/database enables a researcher to query a few words of an entry to bring up the already established term or phrase, thus improving accuracy and saving time.<ref name=tws2NovY323/>\n* ''Makes searching more predictable''.<ref name=\"tws2NovY909\">{{cite news|url=http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/staff/training/training_docs/authority_control_unicorn.shtml|title=Authority Control in Unicorn WorkFlows August 2001|last=Rutgers University Libraries.|first=|date=2012|work=|access-date=23 January 2020|url-status=live|publisher=|quote=Why Authority Control?}}</ref> It can be used in conjunction with keyword searching using \"and\" or \"not\" or \"or\" or other [[Logical connective|Boolean operators]] on a web browser.<ref name=tws2NovY877/> It increases chances that a given search will return relevant items.<ref name=\"tws2NovY323\">{{cite news|url=https://staff.lib.ncsu.edu/confluence/display/MNC/brief+guidelines+on+authority+control+decision-making|title=Brief guidelines on authority control decision-making|last=NCSU Libraries.|first=|date=2012|work=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113100248/https://staff.lib.ncsu.edu/confluence/display/MNC/brief+guidelines+on+authority+control+decision-making|archive-date=13 January 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Consistency of records''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/authorityworkcre00burg|url-access=registration|title=Authority work: The creation, use, maintenance, and evaluation of authority records and files.|last=Burger|first=R.H.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1985|isbn=9780872874916|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=orhBAAAACAAJ | title=Authority Control: Principles, Applications, and Instructions | publisher=UMI Books on Demand | author=Clack, D.H. | year=1990 | isbn=9780608014432}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/maxwellsguidetoa00maxw_0|url-access=registration|title=Maxwell's guide to authority work|last=Maxwell|first=R.L.|publisher=American Library Association|year=2002|isbn=9780838908228|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* ''Organization and structure of information''.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/>\n* ''Efficiency for catalogers''. The process of authority control is not only of great help to researchers searching for a particular subject to study, but it can help catalogers organize information as well.

It can help catch errors caused by typos or misspellings which can sometimes accumulate over time, sometimes known as ''quality drift''.

(5113074392).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] is described in one authority file as \"Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\" which is an official heading.]]\n\nSometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for only one person or subject.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/><ref name = tws2NovY909 />  This can bring confusion since researchers may miss some information. Authority control is used by catalogers to [[collocation|collocate]] materials that logically belong together but which present themselves differently. Records are used to establish [[uniform title]]s which collocate all versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such versions are issued under different titles. With authority control, one unique preferred name represents all variations and will include different variations, spellings and misspellings, uppercase versus lowercase variants, differing dates, and so forth. For example, in Wikipedia, the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] is described by an article [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] as well as numerous other descriptors, e.g. [[Princess Diana]], but both ''Princess Diana'' and ''Diana, Princess of Wales'' describe the same person; an authority record would choose one title as the preferred one for consistency. In an online library catalog, various entries might look like the following:<ref name=tws2NovY111 /><ref name=\"ALT-for-dead-link-footnote\"/>\n\n::#Diana. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (13)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997 (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (2)\n::#DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES, 1961\u20131997. (1)\n\nThese different terms describe the same person. Accordingly, authority control reduces these entries to one unique entry or official authorized heading, sometimes termed an ''access point'':\n\n::Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n{{clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:35%; border:solid 1px #cccccc; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background-color:#f8f8f8\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n\n|-style=\"background-color:#ccccff; font-size:1.1em;\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Authority File</span>\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Heading / ID</span>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|Virtual International Authority File}}\n|VIAF ID: 107032638\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikipedia\n|Diana, Princess of Wales<ref>Note: this is the article title as of March 12, 2013</ref>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikidata\n|Wikidata identifier: [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9685 Q9685]\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND)\n|GND ID: 118525123\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Library of Congress|U.S. Library of Congress]]\n|Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[WorldCat]] Identities\n|Diana Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[National Library of Spain|Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]\n|Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Getty Union List of Artist Names\n|Diana, Princess of Wales English noble and patron, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|[[National Library of the Netherlands]]}}\n|Diana, prinses van Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n|}\nGenerally there are different authority file headings and identifiers used by different libraries in different countries, possibly inviting confusion, but there are different approaches internationally to try to lessen the confusion. One international effort to prevent such confusion is the [[Virtual International Authority File]] which is a collaborative attempt to provide a single heading for a particular subject. It is a way to standardize information from different authority files around the world such as the [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND) maintained and used cooperatively by many libraries in German-speaking countries and the United States [[Library of Congress]]. The idea is to create a single worldwide virtual authority file. For example, the ID for [[Princess Diana]] in the GND is ''118525123'' (preferred name: ''Diana &lt;Wales, Prinzessin&gt;'') while the United States Library of Congress uses the term ''Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997'';  other authority files have other choices. The Virtual International Authority File choice for all of these variations is ''VIAF ID: 107032638'' \u2014 that is, a common number representing all of these variations.<ref name=\"VIAF\">[[viaf:107032638/|Virtual International Authority File]]. Records for Princess Diana, Retrieved on 12 March 2013</ref>\n\nThe English Wikipedia prefers the term \"Diana, Princess of Wales\", but at the bottom of the article about her, there are links to various international cataloging efforts for reference purposes.\n\n===Same name describes two different subjects===\nSometimes two different authors have been published under the same name.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This can happen if there is a title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918\u20131965 when the person [[Floruit|flourished]], or a brief descriptive epithet. When catalogers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can [[Word-sense disambiguation|disambiguate]] them using authority control.\n\n==Authority records and files==\nA customary way of enforcing authority control in a bibliographic catalog is to set up a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalog. This separate index is often referred to as an \"authority file.\" It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by catalogers in a given library (or\u2014as is increasingly the case\u2014cataloging consortium), which catalogers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings.  As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.<ref name =tws2NovY434 />\n\nWhile authority files provide information about a particular subject, their primary function is not to provide information but to organize it.<ref name=\"tws2NovY434\">{{cite news|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html|title=A bird's eye view of authority control in cataloging|last=Calhoun|first=K.|date=1998|newspaper=Cornell University Library|accessdate=25 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> They contain enough information to establish that a given author or title is unique, but that is all; irrelevant but interesting information is generally excluded.  Although practices vary internationally, authority records in the English-speaking world generally contain the following information:\n\n* ''Headings'' show the preferred title chosen as the official and authorized version. It is important that the heading be unique; if there is a conflict with an identical heading, then one of the two will have to be chosen:\n{{Quote |Since the headings function as access points, making sure that they are distinct and not in conflict with existing entries is important. For example, the English novelist William Collins (1824\u201389), whose works include the Moonstone and The Woman in White is better known as Wilkie Collins. Cataloguers have to decide which name the public would most likely look under, and whether to use a see also reference to link alternative forms of an individual's name.|Mason, M.K.|title=Purpose of authority work and files|source=http://www.moyak.com/papers/libraries-bibliographic-control.html}}\n* ''Cross references'' are other forms of the name or title that might appear in the catalog and include:\n#''see'' references are forms of the name or title that describe the subject but which have been passed over or ''deprecated'' in favor of the authorized heading form\n#''see also'' references point to other forms of the name or title that are also authorized. These ''see also'' references generally point to earlier or later forms of a name or title.\n* ''Statement(s) of justification'' is a brief account made by the cataloger about particular information sources used to determine both authorized and deprecated forms. Sometimes this means citing the title and publication date of the source, the location of the name or title on that source, and the form in which it appears on that source.\n\n[[File:An example of an authority record.png|thumb|right|300px]]\nFor example, the Irish writer [[Brian O'Nolan]], who lived from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many [[pen name]]s such as Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form\u2014\"O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966\"\u2014as the official heading.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://authorities.loc.gov/ | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Authorities files }}; the original record has been abbreviated for clarity.</ref>  The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading ''O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966'' is the form of the name that the [[Library of Congress]] chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with ''Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966'' are the ''see'' references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: \"See O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966.\" There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: \"Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966\" has an extra ''C'' inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized ''C'' shows the correct root word while the preceding ''g'' indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. ''See also'' references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with ''His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939.'' constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds'', whereas the author's other ''noms de plume'' appeared on later publications.\n[[File:Sample Catalog Record.png|thumb|220px|Card catalog records such as this one used to be physical cards contained in long rectangular drawers in a library; today, generally, this information is stored in online databases.<ref name = \"Calhoun\">{{Cite journal | first = Karen | last = Calhoun | publisher = Cornell University Library | url = http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html | title = A Bird's Eye View of Authority Control in Cataloging }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Sample Name Authority Record.png|thumb|220px|Authority control with \"Kesey, Ken\" as the chosen heading.<ref name = \"Calhoun\" />]]\n\n==Access control==\nThe act of choosing a single authorized heading to represent all forms of a name is quite often a difficult and complex task, considering that any given individual may have legally changed their name or used a variety of legal names in the course of their lifetime, as well as a variety of nicknames, pen names, stage names or other alternative names. It may be particularly difficult to choose a single authorized heading for individuals whose various names have controversial political or social connotations, when the choice of authorized heading may be seen as endorsement of the associated political or social ideology.\n\nAn alternative to using authorized headings is the idea of ''access control,'' where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.<ref>Barnhart, L.

Retrieved on 28 January 2020.</ref>\n\n==Cooperative cataloging==\nBefore the advent of digital [[online public access catalog]]s and the Internet, creating and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the authority files of the different libraries. For the early part of library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.\n\nAs libraries became more attuned to the needs of researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as [[OCLC]] and [[RLIN]] in the [[United States]], in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.\n\nIn the United States, the primary organization for maintaining cataloging standards with respect to authority work operates under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]], and is known as the Name Authority Cooperative Program, or NACO Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/|title=Program for

Subject headings from the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress]] fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort to keep up with these changes and try to bring \"structure and order\" to the task of helping users find information.<ref name=tws2NovY312 />\n\n==Benefits of authority control==\n* ''Better researching''. Authority control helps researchers get a handle on a specific subject with less wasted effort.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> A well-designed digital catalog/database enables a researcher to query a few words of an entry to bring up the already established term or phrase, thus improving accuracy and saving time.<ref name=tws2NovY323/>\n* ''Makes searching more predictable''.<ref name=\"tws2NovY909\">{{cite news|url=http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/staff/training/training_docs/authority_control_unicorn.shtml|title=Authority Control in Unicorn WorkFlows August 2001|last=Rutgers University Libraries.|first=|date=2012|work=|access-date=23 January 2020|url-status=live|publisher=|quote=Why Authority Control?}}</ref> It can be used in conjunction with keyword searching using \"and\" or \"not\" or \"or\" or other [[Logical connective|Boolean operators]] on a web browser.<ref name=tws2NovY877/> It increases chances that a given search will return relevant items.<ref name=\"tws2NovY323\">{{cite news|url=https://staff.lib.ncsu.edu/confluence/display/MNC/brief+guidelines+on+authority+control+decision-making|title=Brief guidelines on authority control decision-making|last=NCSU Libraries.|first=|date=2012|work=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113100248/https://staff.lib.ncsu.edu/confluence/display/MNC/brief+guidelines+on+authority+control+decision-making|archive-date=13 January 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Consistency of records''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/authorityworkcre00burg|url-access=registration|title=Authority work: The creation, use, maintenance, and evaluation of authority records and files.|last=Burger|first=R.H.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1985|isbn=9780872874916|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=orhBAAAACAAJ | title=Authority Control: Principles, Applications, and Instructions | publisher=UMI Books on Demand | author=Clack, D.H. | year=1990 | isbn=9780608014432}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/maxwellsguidetoa00maxw_0|url-access=registration|title=Maxwell's guide to authority work|last=Maxwell|first=R.L.|publisher=American Library Association|year=2002|isbn=9780838908228|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* ''Organization and structure of information''.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/>\n* ''Efficiency for catalogers''. The process of authority control is not only of great help to researchers searching for a particular subject to study, but it can help catalogers organize information as well.

(5113074392).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] is described in one authority file as \"Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\" which is an official heading.]]\n\nSometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for only one person or subject.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/><ref name = tws2NovY909 />  This can bring confusion since researchers may miss some information. Authority control is used by catalogers to [[collocation|collocate]] materials that logically belong together but which present themselves differently. Records are used to establish [[uniform title]]s which collocate all versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such versions are issued under different titles. With authority control, one unique preferred name represents all variations and will include different variations, spellings and misspellings, uppercase versus lowercase variants, differing dates, and so forth. For example, in Wikipedia, the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] is described by an article [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] as well as numerous other descriptors, e.g. [[Princess Diana]], but both ''Princess Diana'' and ''Diana, Princess of Wales'' describe the same person; an authority record would choose one title as the preferred one for consistency. In an online library catalog, various entries might look like the following:<ref name=tws2NovY111 /><ref name=\"ALT-for-dead-link-footnote\"/>\n\n::#Diana. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales. (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (13)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997 (1)\n::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997 (2)\n::#DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES, 1961\u20131997. (1)\n\nThese different terms describe the same person. Accordingly, authority control reduces these entries to one unique entry or official authorized heading, sometimes termed an ''access point'':\n\n::Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n{{clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:35%; border:solid 1px #cccccc; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background-color:#f8f8f8\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n\n|-style=\"background-color:#ccccff; font-size:1.1em;\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Authority File</span>\n|<span style=\"font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 3px;\">Heading / ID</span>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|Virtual International Authority File}}\n|VIAF ID: 107032638\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikipedia\n|Diana, Princess of Wales<ref>Note: this is the article title as of March 12, 2013</ref>\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Wikidata\n|Wikidata identifier: [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9685 Q9685]\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND)\n|GND ID: 118525123\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[Library of Congress|U.S. Library of Congress]]\n|Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[WorldCat]] Identities\n|Diana Princess of Wales 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [[National Library of Spain|Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]\n|Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Getty Union List of Artist Names\n|Diana, Princess of Wales English noble and patron, 1961\u20131997\n\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | {{nobr|[[National Library of the Netherlands]]}}\n|Diana, prinses van Wales, 1961\u20131997<ref name=VIAF/>\n|}\nGenerally there are different authority file headings and identifiers used by different libraries in different countries, possibly inviting confusion, but there are different approaches internationally to try to lessen the confusion. One international effort to prevent such confusion is the [[Virtual International Authority File]] which is a collaborative attempt to provide a single heading for a particular subject. It is a way to standardize information from different authority files around the world such as the [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND) maintained and used cooperatively by many libraries in German-speaking countries and the United States [[Library of Congress]]. The idea is to create a single worldwide virtual authority file. For example, the ID for [[Princess Diana]] in the GND is ''118525123'' (preferred name: ''Diana &lt;Wales, Prinzessin&gt;'') while the United States Library of Congress uses the term ''Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961\u20131997'';  other authority files have other choices. The Virtual International Authority File choice for all of these variations is ''VIAF ID: 107032638'' \u2014 that is, a common number representing all of these variations.<ref name=\"VIAF\">[[viaf:107032638/|Virtual International Authority File]]. Records for Princess Diana, Retrieved on 12 March 2013</ref>\n\nThe English Wikipedia prefers the term \"Diana, Princess of Wales\", but at the bottom of the article about her, there are links to various international cataloging efforts for reference purposes.\n\n===Same name describes two different subjects===\nSometimes two different authors have been published under the same name.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This can happen if there is a title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918\u20131965 when the person [[Floruit|flourished]], or a brief descriptive epithet. When catalogers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can [[Word-sense disambiguation|disambiguate]] them using authority control.\n\n==Authority records and files==\nA customary way of enforcing authority control in a bibliographic catalog is to set up a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalog. This separate index is often referred to as an \"authority file.\" It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by catalogers in a given library (or\u2014as is increasingly the case\u2014cataloging consortium), which catalogers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings.  As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.<ref name =tws2NovY434 />\n\nWhile authority files provide information about a particular subject, their primary function is not to provide information but to organize it.<ref name=\"tws2NovY434\">{{cite news|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html|title=A bird's eye view of authority control in cataloging|last=Calhoun|first=K.|date=1998|newspaper=Cornell University Library|accessdate=25 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> They contain enough information to establish that a given author or title is unique, but that is all; irrelevant but interesting information is generally excluded.  Although practices vary internationally, authority records in the English-speaking world generally contain the following information:\n\n* ''Headings'' show the preferred title chosen as the official and authorized version. It is important that the heading be unique; if there is a conflict with an identical heading, then one of the two will have to be chosen:\n{{Quote |Since the headings function as access points, making sure that they are distinct and not in conflict with existing entries is important. For example, the English novelist William Collins (1824\u201389), whose works include the Moonstone and The Woman in White is better known as Wilkie Collins. Cataloguers have to decide which name the public would most likely look under, and whether to use a see also reference to link alternative forms of an individual's name.|Mason, M.K.|title=Purpose of authority work and files|source=http://www.moyak.com/papers/libraries-bibliographic-control.html}}\n* ''Cross references'' are other forms of the name or title that might appear in the catalog and include:\n#''see'' references are forms of the name or title that describe the subject but which have been passed over or ''deprecated'' in favor of the authorized heading form\n#''see also'' references point to other forms of the name or title that are also authorized. These ''see also'' references generally point to earlier or later forms of a name or title.\n* ''Statement(s) of justification'' is a brief account made by the cataloger about particular information sources used to determine both authorized and deprecated forms. Sometimes this means citing the title and publication date of the source, the location of the name or title on that source, and the form in which it appears on that source.\n\n[[File:An example of an authority record.png|thumb|right|300px]]\nFor example, the Irish writer [[Brian O'Nolan]], who lived from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many [[pen name]]s such as Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form\u2014\"O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966\"\u2014as the official heading.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://authorities.loc.gov/ | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Authorities files }}; the original record has been abbreviated for clarity.</ref>  The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading ''O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966'' is the form of the name that the [[Library of Congress]] chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with ''Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966'' are the ''see'' references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: \"See O'Brien, Flann, 1911\u20131966.\" There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: \"Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911\u20131966\" has an extra ''C'' inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized ''C'' shows the correct root word while the preceding ''g'' indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. ''See also'' references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with ''His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939.'' constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds'', whereas the author's other ''noms de plume'' appeared on later publications.\n[[File:Sample Catalog Record.png|thumb|220px|Card catalog records such as this one used to be physical cards contained in long rectangular drawers in a library; today, generally, this information is stored in online databases.<ref name = \"Calhoun\">{{Cite journal | first = Karen | last = Calhoun | publisher = Cornell University Library | url = http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html | title = A Bird's Eye View of Authority Control in Cataloging }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Sample Name Authority Record.png|thumb|220px|Authority control with \"Kesey, Ken\" as the chosen heading.<ref name = \"Calhoun\" />]]\n\n==Access control==\nThe act of choosing a single authorized heading to represent all forms of a name is quite often a difficult and complex task, considering that any given individual may have legally changed their name or used a variety of legal names in the course of their lifetime, as well as a variety of nicknames, pen names, stage names or other alternative names. It may be particularly difficult to choose a single authorized heading for individuals whose various names have controversial political or social connotations, when the choice of authorized heading may be seen as endorsement of the associated political or social ideology.\n\nAn alternative to using authorized headings is the idea of ''access control,'' where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.<ref>Barnhart, L.

Retrieved on 28 January 2020.</ref>\n\n==Cooperative cataloging==\nBefore the advent of digital [[online public access catalog]]s and the Internet, creating and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the authority files of the different libraries. For the early part of library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.\n\nAs libraries became more attuned to the needs of researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as [[OCLC]] and [[RLIN]] in the [[United States]], in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.\n\nIn the United States, the primary organization for maintaining cataloging standards with respect to authority work operates under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]], and is known as the Name Authority Cooperative Program, or NACO Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/|title=Program for

Then, the connecting lines (S12, S29, S41) are numbered with two-digit numbers, composing of the numbers of the main lines to which they connect. The lines named \"R3\" etc. are fast trains which run along the same tracks as the S-lines but still stop at multiple stations integrated into the PID system.\n\n==Plans for the future==\nIn the future, it is planned to improve the system significantly, mostly by building new stations on existing lines, upgrading the lines, and integrating more of the existing lines to the system. The Nov\u00e9 Spojen\u00ed 2 is a planned underground tunnel with new stations in the inner city, which will free up capacity on existing lines for longer distance services.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-articles/73452/adapting-demand-railways-prague/|title=Adapting to meet demand: the railways in and around Prague|website=Intelligent Transport|date=17 August 2016|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThere are also plans to build completely new lines, such as a branch from the station [[Praha-Ruzyn\u011b]] to the [[V\u00e1clav_Havel_Airport_Prague|V\u00e1clav Havel airport]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Esko Praha|Esko Prague}}\n* {{official website}}\n* [https://pid.cz/wp-content/uploads/mapy/schemata-trvala/a4_linky_s.pdf Network map] \n* [http://www.praha-kladno.cz Prague-Kladno] (Czech) - website of the project to upgrade the Prague-Kladno line (S5) together with building a branch to the airport\n\n[[Category:Transport in Prague]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Public transit\n|name = Esko Prague\n|image = Esko Praha logo.svg\n|imagesize = 90px\n|locale = [[Prague]] and [[Central Bohemian Region]]\n|transit_type = [[Commuter rail]]\n|lines = 30 (starting in Prague)\n|website = [https://pid.cz/en/trains PID Trains]\n|began_operation = 2007\n|system_length = {{convert|1183|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|160|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in Prague)\n|vehicles =\n|stations = 392 (45 in Prague)\n|ridership = 137,890 (weekday)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsk-praha.cz/static/udi-rocenka-2017-en.pdf|title=Prague Transportation Yearbook 2017 (p. 20, 21)}}</ref>\n|annual_ridership = 39,448,000 \n|track_gauge = {{RailGauge|sg}} ([[standard gauge]])\n|average_speed = 54.7 kmph\n|reporting marks = \n|operator = [[Czech Railways]]<ref>[https://www.cd.cz/en/typy-jizdenek/regionalni-jizdenky-ids/-27769/ Czech Railways trains in PID]</ref>, [[:cs:ARRIVA vlaky]], [[:cs:K\u017dC Doprava]]\n}}\n\n'''Esko Prague''' is a [[commuter rail]] system, part of the [[Prague Integrated Transport]] (PID), serving the city of Prague and the surrounding areas of the [[Central Bohemian Region]].

As well as hunting, other activities required tools such as preparing food, \u201c...nutting, leatherworking, grain harvesting and woodworking...\u201d Included in this group are \u201cflake stone tools\".\n\nTools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the [[food chain]]; by inventing tools, they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not, such as using a [[spear]] or [[archery|bow and arrow]] to kill prey, since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals' skins. \u201cMan the hunter\u201d as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned. Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites, it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators' carcasses rather than killing their own food.<ref name=Holmes>{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Bob |title=Man's early hunting role in doubt |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3222-mans-early-hunting-role-in-doubt.html |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Mechanics|Mechanical]] devices experienced a major expansion in their use in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] with the systematic employment of new energy sources, especially [[waterwheel]]s. Their use expanded through the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] with the addition of [[windmill]]s.\n\n[[Machine tool]]s occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the [[industrial revolution]]. Advocates of [[nanotechnology]] expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025003855/http://www.forbes.com/2004/01/28/cx_dw_0129pollnanotechmidas04_xyz.html Nanotechnology: Big Potential In Tiny Particles], David Whelan.

Arabe. Retrieved on November 6, 2006</ref>\n\n==Functions==\nOne can classify tools according to their basic functions:\n* Cutting and edge tools, such as the [[knife]], [[sickle]], [[scythe]], [[hatchet]], and [[axe]] are wedge-shaped implements that produce a [[Shear stress|shearing force]] along a narrow face. Ideally, the edge of the tool needs to be [[Hardness|harder]] than the material being cut or else the blade will become dulled with repeated use. But even resilient tools will require periodic [[sharpening]], which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge. Other examples of cutting tools include [[Chisel#Gouge|gouges]] and [[drill bit]]s.\n* Moving tools move large and tiny items. Many are [[lever]]s which give the user a [[mechanical advantage]]. Examples of force-concentrating tools include the [[hammer]] which moves a nail or the [[Post maul|maul]] which moves a stake. These operate by applying [[compression (physical)|physical compression]] to a surface. In the case of the [[screwdriver]], the force is rotational and called [[torque]]. By contrast, an [[anvil]] concentrates force on an object being hammered by ''preventing'' it from moving away when struck.  [[Writing implement]]s deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge. Grabbing and twisting nuts and bolts with [[pliers]], a glove, a [[wrench]], etc. likewise move items by applying torque (rotational force).\n* Tools that enact chemical changes, including temperature and ignition, such as [[lighter]]s and [[blowtorch]]es.\n* Guiding, measuring and perception tools include the [[ruler]], [[glasses]], [[set square]], [[sensor]]s, [[straightedge]], [[theodolite]], [[microscope]], [[Computer monitor|monitor]], [[clock]], phone, [[printer (computing)|printer]]\n* Shaping tools, such as [[Molding (process)|molds]], [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[trowel]]s.\n* Fastening tools, such as [[welder]]s, [[rivet gun]]s, [[nail gun]]s, or [[glue gun]]s.\n* Information and data manipulation tools, such as computers, [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[spreadsheet]]s\n\nSome tools may be combinations of other tools. An alarm-clock is for example a combination of a measuring tool (the clock) and a perception tool (the alarm). This enables the alarm-clock to be a tool that falls outside of all the categories mentioned above.\n\nThere is some debate on whether to consider protective gear items as tools, because they do not directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work.  [[Personal protective equipment]] includes such items as gloves, [[safety glasses]], [[earplug|ear defenders]] and [[biohazard]] suits.\n\n===Simple machines===\n{{Main|Simple machine}}\nA simple machine is a  mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a [[force]].<ref name=\"Paul-Roy-Mukherjee-2005\">{{Citation |last=Paul |first=Akshoy |last2=Roy |first2=Pijush |last3=Mukherjee |first3=Sanchayan |title=Mechanical sciences: engineering mechanics and strength of materials |year=2005 |publisher=Prentice Hall of India |isbn=81-203-2611-3 |page=215 |postscript=.}}</ref>  In general, they are the simplest mechanisms that use [[mechanical advantage]] (also called [[lever]]age) to multiply force.<ref name=\"Asimov1988\">{{Citation |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Understanding Physics |year=1988 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |location=New York City|isbn=0-88029-251-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSKvaLV6zkcC&pg=PA88&dq=Asimov+simple+machine&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=88 |postscript=.}}</ref>   The six classical simple machines which were defined by [[Renaissance]] scientists are:<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=William Ballantyne |title=Physics for Technical Students: Mechanics and Heat |year=1914 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York City |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pa0IAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=2008-05-11 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pa0IAAAAIAAJ/page/n131 112]\u201322}}</ref>\n* [[Lever]]\n* [[Wheel and axle]]\n* [[Pulley]]\n* [[Inclined plane]]\n* [[Wedge (mechanical device)|Wedge]]\n* [[Screw (simple machine)|Screw]]\n\n===Tool substitution===\nOften, by design or coincidence, a tool may share key functional attributes with one or more other tools. In this case, some tools can substitute for other tools, either as a makeshift solution or as a matter of practical efficiency. \"One tool does it all\" is a motto of some importance for workers who cannot practically carry every specialized tool to the location of every work task; such as a carpenter who does not necessarily work in a shop all day and needs to do jobs in a customer's house. Tool substitution may be divided broadly into two classes: substitution \"by-design\", or \"multi-purpose\", and substitution as makeshift. Substitution \"by-design\" would be tools that are designed specifically to accomplish multiple tasks using only that one tool.\n\nSubstitution as makeshift is when human ingenuity comes into play and a tool is used for its unintended purpose such as a mechanic using a long screw driver to separate a cars control arm from a ball joint instead of using a tuning fork. In many cases, the designed secondary functions of tools are not widely known. As an example of the former, many wood-cutting [[hand saws]] integrate a [[carpenter's square]] by incorporating a specially shaped handle that allows 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 angles to be marked by aligning the appropriate part of the handle with an edge and scribing along the back edge of the saw. The latter is illustrated by the saying \"All tools can be used as hammers.\" Nearly all tools can be used to function as a hammer, even though very few tools are intentionally designed for it and even fewer work as well as the original.\n\nTools are also often used to substitute for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices.  In many cases a cheap tool could be used to occupy the place of a missing mechanical part. A window roller in a car could easily be replaced with a pair of [[Locking pliers|vise-grips]] or regular [[pliers]]. A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screw-driver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a [[rotary tool]] would be considered the substitution \"by-design\", or \"multi-purpose\". This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. \"Multi-purpose\" tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool. Tools such as this are often power tools that come with many different attachments like a rotary tool does, so you could say that a power drill is a \"multi-purpose\" tool because you can do more than just one thing with a power drill.\n\n===Multi-use tools===\n[[File:Bicycle multi-tool.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Bicycle multi-tool]]\n\nA [[multi-tool]] is a hand tool that incorporates several tools into a single, portable device; the [[Swiss army knife]] represents one of the earliest examples. Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality \u2013 for example, [[lineman's pliers]] incorporate a gripper and cutter, and are often used as a hammer; and some [[hand saw]]s incorporate a [[Set square|carpenter's square]] in the right-angle between the blade's dull edge and the saw's handle. This would also be the category of \"multi-purpose\" tools, since they are also multiple tools in one (multi-use and multi-purpose can be used interchangeably \u2013 compare [[hand axe]]). These types of tools were specifically made {{by whom|date=September 2018}} to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work. To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things. With this new revolution of tools the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites, in that their space would be limited to the vehicle or to the beast of burden they were driving. Multi-use tools solve the problem of having to deal with many different tools.\n\n==Use by other animals==\n[[File:BonoboFishing05.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Bonobo]] at the [[San Diego Zoo]] \"fishing\" for [[termite]]s]]\n{{Main|Tool use by animals}}\n\nObservation has confirmed that [[Tool use by animals|a number of species can use tools]] including [[monkey]]s, [[ape]]s, elephants, several birds, and [[sea otter]]s.

Now, more tools are recognized as culturally and historically relevant. As well as hunting, other activities required tools such as preparing food, \u201c...nutting, leatherworking, grain harvesting and woodworking...\u201d Included in this group are \u201cflake stone tools\".\n\nTools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the [[food chain]]; by inventing tools, they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not, such as using a [[spear]] or [[archery|bow and arrow]] to kill prey, since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals' skins. \u201cMan the hunter\u201d as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned. Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites, it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators' carcasses rather than killing their own food.<ref name=Holmes>{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Bob |title=Man's early hunting role in doubt |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3222-mans-early-hunting-role-in-doubt.html |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Mechanics|Mechanical]] devices experienced a major expansion in their use in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] with the systematic employment of new energy sources, especially [[waterwheel]]s. Their use expanded through the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] with the addition of [[windmill]]s.\n\n[[Machine tool]]s occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the [[industrial revolution]]. Advocates of [[nanotechnology]] expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025003855/http://www.forbes.com/2004/01/28/cx_dw_0129pollnanotechmidas04_xyz.html Nanotechnology: Big Potential In Tiny Particles], David Whelan.

Arabe. Retrieved on November 6, 2006</ref>\n\n==Functions==\nOne can classify tools according to their basic functions:\n* Cutting and edge tools, such as the [[knife]], [[sickle]], [[scythe]], [[hatchet]], and [[axe]] are wedge-shaped implements that produce a [[Shear stress|shearing force]] along a narrow face. Ideally, the edge of the tool needs to be [[Hardness|harder]] than the material being cut or else the blade will become dulled with repeated use. But even resilient tools will require periodic [[sharpening]], which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge. Other examples of cutting tools include [[Chisel#Gouge|gouges]] and [[drill bit]]s.\n* Moving tools move large and tiny items. Many are [[lever]]s which give the user a [[mechanical advantage]]. Examples of force-concentrating tools include the [[hammer]] which moves a nail or the [[Post maul|maul]] which moves a stake. These operate by applying [[compression (physical)|physical compression]] to a surface. In the case of the [[screwdriver]], the force is rotational and called [[torque]]. By contrast, an [[anvil]] concentrates force on an object being hammered by ''preventing'' it from moving away when struck.  [[Writing implement]]s deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge. Grabbing and twisting nuts and bolts with [[pliers]], a glove, a [[wrench]], etc. likewise move items by applying torque (rotational force).\n* Tools that enact chemical changes, including temperature and ignition, such as [[lighter]]s and [[blowtorch]]es.\n* Guiding, measuring and perception tools include the [[ruler]], [[glasses]], [[set square]], [[sensor]]s, [[straightedge]], [[theodolite]], [[microscope]], [[Computer monitor|monitor]], [[clock]], phone, [[printer (computing)|printer]]\n* Shaping tools, such as [[Molding (process)|molds]], [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[trowel]]s.\n* Fastening tools, such as [[welder]]s, [[rivet gun]]s, [[nail gun]]s, or [[glue gun]]s.\n* Information and data manipulation tools, such as computers, [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[spreadsheet]]s\n\nSome tools may be combinations of other tools. An alarm-clock is for example a combination of a measuring tool (the clock) and a perception tool (the alarm). This enables the alarm-clock to be a tool that falls outside of all the categories mentioned above.\n\nThere is some debate on whether to consider protective gear items as tools, because they do not directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work.  [[Personal protective equipment]] includes such items as gloves, [[safety glasses]], [[earplug|ear defenders]] and [[biohazard]] suits.\n\n===Simple machines===\n{{Main|Simple machine}}\nA simple machine is a  mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a [[force]].<ref name=\"Paul-Roy-Mukherjee-2005\">{{Citation |last=Paul |first=Akshoy |last2=Roy |first2=Pijush |last3=Mukherjee |first3=Sanchayan |title=Mechanical sciences: engineering mechanics and strength of materials |year=2005 |publisher=Prentice Hall of India |isbn=81-203-2611-3 |page=215 |postscript=.}}</ref>  In general, they are the simplest mechanisms that use [[mechanical advantage]] (also called [[lever]]age) to multiply force.<ref name=\"Asimov1988\">{{Citation |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Understanding Physics |year=1988 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |location=New York City|isbn=0-88029-251-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSKvaLV6zkcC&pg=PA88&dq=Asimov+simple+machine&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=88 |postscript=.}}</ref>   The six classical simple machines which were defined by [[Renaissance]] scientists are:<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=William Ballantyne |title=Physics for Technical Students: Mechanics and Heat |year=1914 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York City |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pa0IAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=2008-05-11 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pa0IAAAAIAAJ/page/n131 112]\u201322}}</ref>\n* [[Lever]]\n* [[Wheel and axle]]\n* [[Pulley]]\n* [[Inclined plane]]\n* [[Wedge (mechanical device)|Wedge]]\n* [[Screw (simple machine)|Screw]]\n\n===Tool substitution===\nOften, by design or coincidence, a tool may share key functional attributes with one or more other tools. In this case, some tools can substitute for other tools, either as a makeshift solution or as a matter of practical efficiency. \"One tool does it all\" is a motto of some importance for workers who cannot practically carry every specialized tool to the location of every work task; such as a carpenter who does not necessarily work in a shop all day and needs to do jobs in a customer's house. Tool substitution may be divided broadly into two classes: substitution \"by-design\", or \"multi-purpose\", and substitution as makeshift. Substitution \"by-design\" would be tools that are designed specifically to accomplish multiple tasks using only that one tool.\n\nSubstitution as makeshift is when human ingenuity comes into play and a tool is used for its unintended purpose such as a mechanic using a long screw driver to separate a cars control arm from a ball joint instead of using a tuning fork. In many cases, the designed secondary functions of tools are not widely known. As an example of the former, many wood-cutting [[hand saws]] integrate a [[carpenter's square]] by incorporating a specially shaped handle that allows 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 angles to be marked by aligning the appropriate part of the handle with an edge and scribing along the back edge of the saw. The latter is illustrated by the saying \"All tools can be used as hammers.\" Nearly all tools can be used to function as a hammer, even though very few tools are intentionally designed for it and even fewer work as well as the original.\n\nTools are also often used to substitute for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices.  In many cases a cheap tool could be used to occupy the place of a missing mechanical part. A window roller in a car could easily be replaced with a pair of [[Locking pliers|vise-grips]] or regular [[pliers]]. A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screw-driver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a [[rotary tool]] would be considered the substitution \"by-design\", or \"multi-purpose\". This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. \"Multi-purpose\" tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool. Tools such as this are often power tools that come with many different attachments like a rotary tool does, so you could say that a power drill is a \"multi-purpose\" tool because you can do more than just one thing with a power drill.\n\n===Multi-use tools===\n[[File:Bicycle multi-tool.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Bicycle multi-tool]]\n\nA [[multi-tool]] is a hand tool that incorporates several tools into a single, portable device; the [[Swiss army knife]] represents one of the earliest examples. Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality \u2013 for example, [[lineman's pliers]] incorporate a gripper and cutter, and are often used as a hammer; and some [[hand saw]]s incorporate a [[Set square|carpenter's square]] in the right-angle between the blade's dull edge and the saw's handle. This would also be the category of \"multi-purpose\" tools, since they are also multiple tools in one (multi-use and multi-purpose can be used interchangeably \u2013 compare [[hand axe]]). These types of tools were specifically made {{by whom|date=September 2018}} to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work. To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things. With this new revolution of tools the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites, in that their space would be limited to the vehicle or to the beast of burden they were driving. Multi-use tools solve the problem of having to deal with many different tools.\n\n==Use by other animals==\n[[File:BonoboFishing05.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Bonobo]] at the [[San Diego Zoo]] \"fishing\" for [[termite]]s]]\n{{Main|Tool use by animals}}\n\nObservation has confirmed that [[Tool use by animals|a number of species can use tools]] including [[monkey]]s, [[ape]]s, elephants, several birds, and [[sea otter]]s.
