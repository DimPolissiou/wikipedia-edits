The charter for Elon College was issued by the [[North Carolina legislature]] in 1889.  William S. Long was the first president, and the original student body consisted of 76 students. In 1923, a fire destroyed most of the campus, including school records, classrooms, the library, and the chapel. The Board of Trustees voted to rebuild immediately.  Many of the buildings that were erected in the years following the fire still stand and make up the bedrock of Elon's campus.\n\nAn institution that for many years enrolled mostly North Carolina residents, Elon began to enroll significant numbers of students from the mid-Atlantic states in the mid-1970s, and began to improve its academic standards for admission.<ref>George Keller, ''Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction'', ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2004)</ref> By the start of the 21st century, about 68 percent of Elon's students came from out-of-state and were only accepted if they met high academic standards.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''The Review of Higher Education'', http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/review_of_higher_education/v028/28.4renn.html</ref> Elon became known as a selective university<ref>The university was classified as selective by the CIS Higher Education Directory 2010, Council of International Schools, p. 204</ref> and, by 2013, 82% of incoming students were from out of state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/administration/institutional_research/factbooks/FactBookAdm12.pdf |title=Factbook |website= |format=PDF |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>  Elon's transformation was the subject of an academic study by [[George Keller (academic)|George Keller]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] titled ''Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction''.

(Ayd\u0131n, 2013) According to this, Zakariya, who had fled the region after Yahya was executed by Herod the Great, hid in the hollow of a broken tree, but the devil left out one side of his robe, then informed his enemies, so they cut the tree in half, and thus Zakariya was martyred. His people, the Israelites, were not only ignorant to the teachings of their prophet but tortured him also. (Q: 3:21) It is narrated that his tomb is located next to Aleppo Great Mosque.\n\nApart from this, there are thirty-one people mentioned with this name in the Bible: One of them is Zakariya, the father of Yahya, who is described as a Jewish priest in the Gospel of Luke, and is described also in the Qur'an as a prophet sent to the Jews. The other is the one ordained as a prophet under the rule of the Persian King Darius, who took control of the Palestinian region after the Babylonian exile, and he has a book called his own in the Old Testament, which has no concern with Zakariya mentioned in the Qur'an. (Ayd\u0131n, 2013) There is any relation of them with neither Qur'an nor the monument that is called as Mihrab Zakariya. \n\n=='''The Concept of \u201cMihrab\u201d'''==\n\nThe root of the word comes from Arabic meaning \u2018war\u2019, which is connected by great effort and fighting to reach or protect or defend important places. Besides, the Arabic word \u201cmihrab\u201d meaning \u2018the harem part of the palace or the part of the throne of the ruler, the statue cell of the Christian saints, gazebo, pavilion, high ground, the head side of the assembly, the most honorable part\u2019 has been used for the place where the Imam stood in mosques in time. (Erzincan, 2005) The word mihrab is mentioned in four places in the Qur'an: In three of these (Q: 3:37-39, 19:11); Zakariya's entrance and exit to the private place (mihrab) in the masjid, and his prayer there, and in the other, David's private compartment (mihrab)  in the masjid, and the arrival of two people to resolve the conflict between them, are mentioned. It is understood that the mihrab in the verses refers to a special place in the masjid (Beyt\u00fclmakdis). Meharib, the plural of the mihrab, which is mentioned in a verse of Surat Saba\u2019 (Q: 34:13), is described as \u201chigh and magnificent buildings, high places sheltered, epitomes, pavilion, palaces\u201d. (Yaz\u0131r, 1979 \u2013 es-Sabun\u00ee, 1990) The origin of the mihrab dates to the Prophet time. It is known that there was no mihrab of the Masjid Al-Nabawi at the early times and that only the place where the Prophet Muhammed led the prayer was evident. Later, the development of the mihrab, which is considered one of the most important elements of religious architecture, in Islamic art, has spread over a long period.\n\n=='''Mihrab of Zakariya''' ==\n\nAccording to the inscriptions on the mihrab, it is constructed in 888 AH/1483 CE by Al-Ashraf Abu Al-Nasr Qaitibai during the Memluk period. Besides, it was renovated in 1404 A.H/1983 CE by King Fahd bin \u2018Abdul \u2018Aziz Al Sa\u2019ud. It is a masterpiece prayer niche located in the eastern part of Masjid al-Qibly adjacent to the southern wall of the Masjid Al-Aqsa enclave. It was built on behalf of Prophet Zakariya who was a custodian of the Sacred Sanctuary (Masjid al-Aqsa) according to the Qur\u2019anic narration. This space is also said to be the place Maryam was lodged and visited by Zakariya but there is no solid evidence for this. It is located right opposite the Mehrab where the present day Imam would lead prayers. The Mihrab is situated adjacent to an important pillar (the pillar of Mukhalaqa) and its structure has calligraphy that indicates where Prophet Muhammed performed his prayers. Besides, a calligraphy on the cone of the Mihrab is referring to a Qur\u2019anic verse, which says: \u201cEvery time he (Zakaria) he entered Al-Mihrab (a praying place or a private room)\u201d. To the left of the arch column is written a hadith of Prophet Muhammad: \u201cPrayer is the mainstay of religion\u201d. Finally the text within the Mihrab says another Qur\u2019anic ayat: \u201cSuch believers are] the repentant, the worshippers, the praisers (of Allah), the travelers (for His cause), those who bow and prostrate (in prayer), those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those who observe the limits (set by) Allah. And give good tidings to the believers.\u201d (Q: 9:112)\n\n=='''The Historic Inscriptions on the Mihrab'''==\n\nBehind the Mihrab, there is a historic inscription written in the Mamluki Thuluth script, which says: \n\u2018In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful, and Peace be upon our leader Muhammad. This Noble Mihrab has been placed in the prayer place of the Prophet by order of the Humble Slave (of Allah), the Sovereign Ruler, Al-Ashraf Abu Al-Nasr Qaitibai. Allah is Eternal and Supreme. In the month of Dhu Al-Hijjah (of the Sacred Months), in the year 888 A.H.\u201d\nAppended to the aforementioned inscription, in the same script, is the following:\n\u201cIts renovation was ordered by His Majesty, King Fahd bin \u2018Abdul \u2018Aziz Al Sa\u2019ud, Who Glorifies Allah, in the year 1404 A.H.\u201d\n\n\n'''References:''' \nAyd\u0131n, M.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

was conceived by 17 [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the [[Midwest]]. Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]].

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

He explains that his lifestyle has changed after living abroad, and her conservative habits would be a wrong match for him. Stunned at the development, Rani shuts herself in her room for a day. Wanting to take control of the situation, she asks her parents permission to go alone on her pre-booked honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam. After initially hesitating, her parents agree, thinking that a vacation might cheer her up.\n\nIn Paris, Rani meets Vijayalakshmi ([[Lisa Haydon]]), a free-spirited woman of French-Spanish-Indian descent, who works at the hotel in which Rani stays. Overwhelmed by the new city and having gotten into trouble twice \u2013 once with the local police and once with a robber \u2013 Rani intends to return to India. However, Vijayalakshmi helps her out and gives her a tour around the city. The two have a series of adventures, during which Rani relives the memories of Vijay patronising her and forbidding her from dancing and drinking \u2013 which she's free to do in Paris. During one particular incident, Rani tries on what she considers to be a revealing outfit and accidentally sends a [[selfie]] of her wearing the outfit to Vijay instead of Vijayalakshmi. She quickly realises her mistake, but unbeknownst to her, the selfie regenerates his  interest in Rani and Vijay decides to seek her out.\n\nEventually, the time comes for her to bid an emotional farewell to Vijayalakshmi and board the train for Amsterdam. However, when she arrives in Amsterdam, she finds to her horror that her hostel room is being shared with three men: Taka from Japan, Tim from France and Oleksander from Russia. Despite being skeptical, she soon becomes good friends with them, and spends time shopping, sightseeing, visiting a [[sex shop]], going to a [[church (building)|church]] and meeting pole dancers in a club. At the club, Rani befriends a pole dancer, Roxette/Rukhsar ([[Sabeeka Imam]]), a Pakistani girl who is the sole bread-earner for her family back in Lahore and who is also a friend of Vijaylakshmi.\n\nRani slowly begins to gain confidence by taking control of her decisions. She also realizes her earning potential, winning a cook-off by selling [[gol gappa]]s, and experiencing her first kiss with the Italian host of the cooking competition. She learns more about her friends' backgrounds and begins to understand how different life can be for people in other parts of the world. One day, the four friends find Vijay waiting for Rani in front of the hostel. Vijay apologizes to Rani and asks her to reconsider the relationship. Their conversation escalates as he tries to grab hold of Rani, but her friends retaliate, and she asks him to leave. Rani decides to miss out on a concert with her friends, in order to meet with Vijay and discuss the future. Vijay judges Rani's new friends and behaviour, causing her to leave abruptly, saying that she would rather speak to him after she returns to Delhi. She then meets up with her friends one last time at the concert. After bidding an emotional farewell to them, Rani returns to India.\n\nBack in Delhi, Rani visits Vijay at his home. Vijay and his family think that she has decided to forgive him and start discussing wedding plans. Instead, Rani hands him her engagement ring and after saying \"thank you\", walks away with a confident smile on her face.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kangana Ranaut]] as Rani Mehra\n*[[Lisa Haydon]] as Vijayalakshmi\n*[[Rajkumar Rao]] as Vijay\n*[[Mish Boyko]] as Oleksander (Sikander)\n*[[Jeffrey Ho]] as Taka\n*[[Joseph Guitobh]] as Tim\n*[[Marco Canadea]] as Marcello\n*[[Yogendra Tiku]] as Rani's father\n*[[Alka Badola Kaushal]] as Rani's mother\n*Chinmaya Agrawal as Chintu Mehra\n*Tripta Lakhanpal as Dadi\n*Nayani Dixit as Sonal\n*[[Sabeeka Imam]] as Roxette (Rukhsar)\n* [[Alexandre Plasti Melara]] as flying pig drunk #1\n* [[Leonardo Pricoli]] as flying pig drunk #2\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nProducer-director Vikas Bahl made his directorial debut with ''[[Chillar Party]]'' (2011), co-directed with Nitish Tiwari, which won three [[National Film Awards]].

They lose their own perspective on life and they are okay with that.\"<ref name=exp2014/> In a scenario where as a girl crosses 20, her family gets busy to get her \"settled\", she never plans anything by herself, unless as in this case of Rani, marriage plans go awry. Thus the script was developed so that in the \"first half, Rani gets over the guy, and in the second, she gets over herself.\"<ref name=mirror/>  Bahl wrote the script of the movie keeping in mind Kangana Ranaut, however it was [[Anurag Basu]] who connected him with Kangana and helped cast her in the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=How did Vikas Bahl convince Kangana Ranuat for Queen?|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/how-did-vikas-bahl-convince-kangana-ranaut-for-queen/ |publisher=Bollywoodlife.com |accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter her audition, actress Lisa Haydon, who played an Indo-French hotel staff member, Vijaylaksmi, practiced French for a month.

He took a crew of 25 people from India to shoot the film in about 145 locations in 40 days. Locations were booked a couple of hours, before the crew would rush to another location as they often shot 3\u20134 locations in a day.

Later, the film's lead actress [[Kangana Ranaut]] spoke out in support of the former Phantom employee, and corroborated her version of Bahl's sexual harassment. Following this, Nayani Dixit, Ranaut's co-star in the movie, also accused him of sexual misconduct.

At the [[60th Filmfare Awards]] ceremony, the film won six leading awards, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Ranaut. At the [[62nd National Film Awards]] ceremony, the film won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi|Best Hindi Film]] and [[National Film Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] awards.\n\n==Plot==\nRani Mehra  is a shy, meek and young [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] woman from Delhi.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\"/> One day prior to her wedding, her fianc\u00e9 Vijay ([[Rajkummar Rao]]) tells her that he no longer wishes to marry her. He explains that his lifestyle has changed after living abroad, and her conservative habits would be a wrong match for him. Stunned at the development, Rani shuts herself in her room for a day. Wanting to take control of the situation, she asks her parents permission to go alone on her pre-booked honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam. After initially hesitating, her parents agree, thinking that a vacation might cheer her up.\n\nIn Paris, Rani meets Vijayalakshmi ([[Lisa Haydon]]), a free-spirited woman of French-Spanish-Indian descent, who works at the hotel in which Rani stays. Overwhelmed by the new city and having gotten into trouble twice \u2013 once with the local police and once with a robber \u2013 Rani intends to return to India. However, Vijayalakshmi helps her out and gives her a tour around the city. The two have a series of adventures, during which Rani relives the memories of Vijay patronising her and forbidding her from dancing and drinking \u2013 which she's free to do in Paris. During one particular incident, Rani tries on what she considers to be a revealing outfit and accidentally sends a [[selfie]] of her wearing the outfit to Vijay instead of Vijayalakshmi. She quickly realises her mistake, but unbeknownst to her, the selfie regenerates his  interest in Rani and Vijay decides to seek her out.\n\nEventually, the time comes for her to bid an emotional farewell to Vijayalakshmi and board the train for Amsterdam. However, when she arrives in Amsterdam, she finds to her horror that her hostel room is being shared with three men: Taka from Japan, Tim from France and Oleksander from Russia. Despite being skeptical, she soon becomes good friends with them, and spends time shopping, sightseeing, visiting a [[sex shop]], going to a [[church (building)|church]] and meeting pole dancers in a club. At the club, Rani befriends a pole dancer, Roxette/Rukhsar ([[Sabeeka Imam]]), a Pakistani girl who is the sole bread-earner for her family back in Lahore and who is also a friend of Vijaylakshmi.\n\nRani slowly begins to gain confidence by taking control of her decisions. She also realizes her earning potential, winning a cook-off by selling [[gol gappa]]s, and experiencing her first kiss with the Italian host of the cooking competition. She learns more about her friends' backgrounds and begins to understand how different life can be for people in other parts of the world. One day, the four friends find Vijay waiting for Rani in front of the hostel. Vijay apologizes to Rani and asks her to reconsider the relationship. Their conversation escalates as he tries to grab hold of Rani, but her friends retaliate, and she asks him to leave. Rani decides to miss out on a concert with her friends, in order to meet with Vijay and discuss the future. Vijay judges Rani's new friends and behaviour, causing her to leave abruptly, saying that she would rather speak to him after she returns to Delhi. She then meets up with her friends one last time at the concert. After bidding an emotional farewell to them, Rani returns to India.\n\nBack in Delhi, Rani visits Vijay at his home. Vijay and his family think that she has decided to forgive him and start discussing wedding plans. Instead, Rani hands him her engagement ring and after saying \"thank you\", walks away with a confident smile on her face.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kangana Ranaut]] as Rani Mehra\n*[[Lisa Haydon]] as Vijayalakshmi\n*[[Rajkumar Rao]] as Vijay\n*[[Mish Boyko]] as Oleksander (Sikander)\n*[[Jeffrey Ho]] as Taka\n*[[Joseph Guitobh]] as Tim\n*[[Marco Canadea]] as Marcello\n*[[Yogendra Tiku]] as Rani's father\n*[[Alka Badola Kaushal]] as Rani's mother\n*Chinmaya Agrawal as Chintu Mehra\n*Tripta Lakhanpal as Dadi\n*Nayani Dixit as Sonal\n*[[Sabeeka Imam]] as Roxette (Rukhsar)\n* [[Alexandre Plasti Melara]] as flying pig drunk #1\n* [[Leonardo Pricoli]] as flying pig drunk #2\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nProducer-director Vikas Bahl made his directorial debut with ''[[Chillar Party]]'' (2011), co-directed with Nitish Tiwari, which won three [[National Film Awards]].

They lose their own perspective on life and they are okay with that.\"<ref name=exp2014/> In a scenario where as a girl crosses 20, her family gets busy to get her \"settled\", she never plans anything by herself, unless as in this case of Rani, marriage plans go awry. Thus the script was developed so that in the \"first half, Rani gets over the guy, and in the second, she gets over herself.\"<ref name=mirror/>  Bahl wrote the script of the movie keeping in mind Kangana Ranaut, however it was [[Anurag Basu]] who connected him with Kangana and helped cast her in the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=How did Vikas Bahl convince Kangana Ranuat for Queen?|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/how-did-vikas-bahl-convince-kangana-ranaut-for-queen/ |publisher=Bollywoodlife.com |accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter her audition, actress Lisa Haydon, who played an Indo-French hotel staff member, Vijaylaksmi, practiced French for a month.

He took a crew of 25 people from India to shoot the film in about 145 locations in 40 days. Locations were booked a couple of hours, before the crew would rush to another location as they often shot 3\u20134 locations in a day.
