Then, Gauri Kumari Sharma enters his life, whom he looks down upon as an opportunistic, greedy and characterless girl while in reality, Gauri is a caring girl who values relationships and is devoted to [[Lord Shiva]]. Under unforeseen circumstances, both get married but due to uncleared misunderstandings between them, Omkara develops a deep hatred for Gauri and leaves her right after marriage. Subsequently, Gauri, in Chulbul's disguise enters Omkara's home - the Oberoi Mansion and during her time as a domestic help there, she grows very close to him and also plays an active role in making Omkara's mission to expose Svetlana and to get rid of her from their lives, a success. Meanwhile, Kaali Thakur, the local landowner and don of Bareilly returns to Gauri's life seeking revenge as Gauri had left him at the altar. Kaali Thakur and Svetlana team up and manipulate Tej against Jhanvi and Omkara. However, Gauri (as Chulbul) with help from Rudra and Bua Maa (Dolly Oberoi) saves the day. \n\nAfter finally getting rid of Svetlana and Kaali, Gauri has to face Omkara's wrath as he gets to know her true identity. Despite Omkara wanting to throw Gauri out of his life, Gauri still stands by his side, sacrificing her self-pride, to protect Omkara's life from Bua Maa (his aunt) whose sweet gestures were all pretend as she seeks vengeance for her son Ratan's accidental death when he was a child and was trying to save Om from drowning. Gauri exposes Bua Maa. Gauri decides to leave Omkara who by now has developed a soft corner for Gauri and learning from his previous mistakes, decides to give their relationship another chance. This marks the end of ''Dil Boley Oberoi'' and Omkara and Gauri's story continued in ''Ishqbaaaz'', where they have to face more hurdles due to misunderstandings and mistrust in their relationship before finally realizing their feelings for each other.\n\n===Rudra-Saumya \"''RuMya''\" love story===\n''Dil Boley Oberoi'' also marks the continuation of Rudra and Saumya's relationship, initially shown in ''Ishqbaaaz'', where it was shown that Rudra's antics and his arrogance towards Saumya had already put a dent in their relationship. Despite Saumya's repeated efforts to save their drowning relationship, Rudra holds her responsible for the growing tension between his father Tej and elder brother Omkara, and for the other problems of his family, leaving Saumya devastated. Their paths cross again when they are taking the same flight to a mutual friend's engagement. The flight's hijacking leads Saumya and Rudra to work together to save the plane from crashing, but their differences remain, and Saumya realizes that it is high time they ended things. She visits him for the last time, and tells him that they are better off as friends. She then leaves for [[Australia]] to pursue higher studies after parting on good terms with Rudra.\n\n===Rudra-Bhavya \"''RuVya''\" love story===\nAfter his break-up with Saumya, Rudra gets romantically involved with Assistant Commissioner of Police Bhavya Pratap Rathore who is introduced in the series as his new love interest. The fierce Bhavya portrays herself as a cute, shy, and nervous girl in front of Rudra to trap him in an undercover mission against an underworld gangster, infamously known as Sultan. She has a personal score to settle with him as he had killed her parents in a bomb blast. After the Sultan-track (the mystery of which has yet not been uncovered) gets scripted out of the series, Rudra lets go of Bhavya's previous lies to him and they mutually enter into a relationship upon realizing their feelings for each other. Their love-hate relationship continued in the main show, ''Ishqbaaaz''.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Kunal Jaisingh]] as Omkara Singh Oberoi \u2013 Jhanvi and Tej's son; Rudra and Priyanka's brother; Shivaay cousin; Gauri's husband\n*[[Shrenu Parikh]] as Gauri Omkara Singh Oberoi \u2013 Harshvardhan's daughter; Annika's sister; Omkara's wife\n*[[Leenesh Mattoo]] as Rudra Singh Oberoi \u2013 Jhanvi and Tej's son; Omkara and Priyanka's brother; Shivaay's cousin; Bhavya's husband\n*[[Mansi Srivastava]] as ACP Bhavya Rudra Singh Oberoi\u2013 Rudra's wife\n*[[Reyhna Malhotra]] as Svetlana Kapoor \u2013 Tia and Saumya's sister; Tej's former mistress, Omkara's former fianc\u00e9e; Abhay's former wife\n*[[Nehalaxmi Iyer]] as Saumya Kapoor \u2013 Svetlana and Tia's sister; Rudra's former girlfriend\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Mahesh Thakur]] as Tej Singh Oberoi \u2013 Kalyani's son, a ruthless Businessman, Shakti and Roop's brother, Jhanvi's husband, Omkara, Rudra, Priyanka's father and Shivaay's uncle\n*Mreenal Deshraj as Jhanvi Singh Oberoi \u2013 Tej's wife; Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka's mother; Shivaay's step mother\n*[[Navnindra Behl]] as Kalyani Singh Oberoi \u2013 Matriarch of Oberoi family; Prithviraj's wife; Tej, Shakti and Roop's mother; Shivaay, Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka's grandmother\n*[[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Dolly Singh Oberoi \u2013 Kalyani's sister-in-law; Ratan's mother\n*[[Avinash Mishra]] as Abhay Singh Oberoi \u2013 Shivaay, Omkara, Rudra & Priyanka's cousin\n* [[Rahul Dev]] as Kaali Thakur \u2013 Landlord; local don <ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/v/news/hindi/bigg-boss-10-contestant-rahul-dev-bags-a-tv-show/articleshow/56888573.cms|title=Bigg Boss 10 contestant Rahul Dev bags a TV show \u2013 Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Nakuul Mehta]] as Shivaay Singh Oberoi \u2013 Pinky and Shakti's son; Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka's cousin; Annika's husband\n*[[Surbhi Chandna]] as Annika Shivaay Singh Oberoi\u2013 Harshvardhan's daughter; Gauri's sister; Sahil's foster sister; Shivaay's wife\n*Subha Rajput as Priyanka Singh Oberoi \u2013 Jhanvi and Tej's daughter; Omkara and Rudra's sister; Shivaay's cousin; Ranveer's wife\n*[[Ayush Anand]] as Ranveer Singh Randhawa \u2013 Priyanka's husband\n*Nitin Bhatia as Nandi \u2013 Gauri's sworn brother\n\n===Guests===\n*[[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Mohini \u2013 Aditya's ex-girlfriend, a mentally-disturbed girl who seeks revenge and for that hijacked Rudra's flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.com/showbiz/dil-boley-oberoi-sara-khan-enters-ishqbaazs-spin-off-version-as-mentally-disturbed-character-1843916/|title=Dil Boley Oberoi: Sara Khan enters Ishqbaaz\u2019s spin-off version as mentally disturbed character|last=|first=|date=|website=India|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n*[[Nidhi Uttam]] as Jhanvi Thakur \u2013 Kali Thakur's late wife, Committed Suicide by burning her alive.\n*Sehrish Ali as Maya \u2013 Svetlana's assistant who on Svetlana's orders faked herself as a ghost to drive away Omkara's attention from Svetlana's actions.\n*Mrinmai Kolwalkar as The real identity of fake Svetlana kapoor, who had taken up the face of real Svetlana by first resorting to a mask and then, by Plastic Surgery.\n*Rakesh Srivastav as Mr. Dhurandhar \u2013 A court official hired by \"Biggest Aunt\" to bring Omkara-Gauri close to each other, for the success of her mission to get Omkara's son and raise him as her dead son, Ratan.\n*Unknown as Dr. Dang \u2013 He was the only one who knew about Svetlana's surgery because he was the surgeon.

to despise the idea of love and made him distant from the very relationships he once used to cherish, because of traumatic past experiences; be it his father, Tej's affair with his secretary Svetlana and his betrayal to Om's mother Jhanvi or be it his experience of being easily fooled by women who hurt his emotions. Then, Gauri Kumari Sharma enters his life, whom he looks down upon as an opportunistic, greedy and characterless girl while in reality, Gauri is a caring girl who values relationships and is devoted to [[Lord Shiva]]. Under unforeseen circumstances, both get married but due to uncleared misunderstandings between them, Omkara develops a deep hatred for Gauri and leaves her right after marriage. Subsequently, Gauri, in Chulbul's disguise enters Omkara's home - the Oberoi Mansion and during her time as a domestic help there, she grows very close to him and also plays an active role in making Omkara's mission to expose Svetlana and to get rid of her from their lives, a success. Meanwhile, Kaali Thakur, the local landowner and don of Bareilly returns to Gauri's life seeking revenge as Gauri had left him at the altar. Kaali Thakur and Svetlana team up and manipulate Tej against Jhanvi and Omkara. However, Gauri (as Chulbul) with help from Rudra and Bua Maa (Dolly Oberoi) saves the day. \n\nAfter finally getting rid of Svetlana and Kaali, Gauri has to face Omkara's wrath as he gets to know her true identity. Despite Omkara wanting to throw Gauri out of his life, Gauri still stands by his side, sacrificing her self-pride, to protect Omkara's life from Bua Maa (his aunt) whose sweet gestures were all pretend as she seeks vengeance for her son Ratan's accidental death when he was a child and was trying to save Om from drowning. Gauri exposes Bua Maa. Gauri decides to leave Omkara who by now has developed a soft corner for Gauri and learning from his previous mistakes, decides to give their relationship another chance. This marks the end of ''Dil Boley Oberoi'' and Omkara and Gauri's story continued in ''Ishqbaaaz'', where they have to face more hurdles due to misunderstandings and mistrust in their relationship before finally realizing their feelings for each other.\n\n===Rudra-Saumya \"''RuMya''\" love story===\n''Dil Boley Oberoi'' also marks the continuation of Rudra and Saumya's relationship, initially shown in ''Ishqbaaaz'', where it was shown that Rudra's antics and his arrogance towards Saumya had already put a dent in their relationship. Despite Saumya's repeated efforts to save their drowning relationship, Rudra holds her responsible for the growing tension between his father Tej and elder brother Omkara, and for the other problems of his family, leaving Saumya devastated. Their paths cross again when they are taking the same flight to a mutual friend's engagement. The flight's hijacking leads Saumya and Rudra to work together to save the plane from crashing, but their differences remain, and Saumya realizes that it is high time they ended things. She visits him for the last time, and tells him that they are better off as friends. She then leaves for [[Australia]] to pursue higher studies after parting on good terms with Rudra.\n\n===Rudra-Bhavya \"''RuVya''\" love story===\nAfter his break-up with Saumya, Rudra gets romantically involved with Assistant Commissioner of Police Bhavya Pratap Rathore who is introduced in the series as his new love interest. The fierce Bhavya portrays herself as a cute, shy, and nervous girl in front of Rudra to trap him in an undercover mission against an underworld gangster, infamously known as Sultan. She has a personal score to settle with him as he had killed her parents in a bomb blast. After the Sultan-track (the mystery of which has yet not been uncovered) gets scripted out of the series, Rudra lets go of Bhavya's previous lies to him and they mutually enter into a relationship upon realizing their feelings for each other. Their love-hate relationship continued in the main show, ''Ishqbaaaz''.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Kunal Jaisingh]] as Omkara Singh Oberoi \u2013 Jhanvi and Tej's son; Rudra and Priyanka's brother; Shivaay cousin; Gauri's husband\n*[[Shrenu Parikh]] as Gauri Omkara Singh Oberoi \u2013 Harshvardhan's daughter; Annika's sister; Omkara's wife\n*[[Leenesh Mattoo]] as Rudra Singh Oberoi \u2013 Jhanvi and Tej's son; Omkara and Priyanka's brother; Shivaay's cousin; Bhavya's husband\n*[[Mansi Srivastava]] as ACP Bhavya Rudra Singh Oberoi\u2013 Rudra's wife\n*[[Reyhna Malhotra]] as Svetlana Kapoor \u2013 Tia and Saumya's sister; Tej's former mistress, Omkara's former fianc\u00e9e; Abhay's former wife\n*[[Nehalaxmi Iyer]] as Saumya Kapoor \u2013 Svetlana and Tia's sister; Rudra's former girlfriend\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Mahesh Thakur]] as Tej Singh Oberoi \u2013 Kalyani's son, a ruthless Businessman, Shakti and Roop's brother, Jhanvi's husband, Omkara, Rudra, Priyanka's father and Shivaay's uncle\n*Mreenal Deshraj as Jhanvi Singh Oberoi \u2013 Tej's wife; Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka's mother; Shivaay's step mother\n*[[Navnindra Behl]] as Kalyani Singh Oberoi \u2013 Matriarch of Oberoi family; Prithviraj's wife; Tej, Shakti and Roop's mother; Shivaay, Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka's grandmother\n*[[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Dolly Singh Oberoi \u2013 Kalyani's sister-in-law; Ratan's mother\n*[[Avinash Mishra]] as Abhay Singh Oberoi \u2013 Shivaay, Omkara, Rudra & Priyanka's cousin\n* [[Rahul Dev]] as Kaali Thakur \u2013 Landlord; local don <ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/v/news/hindi/bigg-boss-10-contestant-rahul-dev-bags-a-tv-show/articleshow/56888573.cms|title=Bigg Boss 10 contestant Rahul Dev bags a TV show \u2013 Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Nakuul Mehta]] as Shivaay Singh Oberoi \u2013 Pinky and Shakti's son; Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka's cousin; Annika's husband\n*[[Surbhi Chandna]] as Annika Shivaay Singh Oberoi\u2013 Harshvardhan's daughter; Gauri's sister; Sahil's foster sister; Shivaay's wife\n*Subha Rajput as Priyanka Singh Oberoi \u2013 Jhanvi and Tej's daughter; Omkara and Rudra's sister; Shivaay's cousin; Ranveer's wife\n*[[Ayush Anand]] as Ranveer Singh Randhawa \u2013 Priyanka's husband\n*[[Nitin Bhatia]] as Nandi \u2013 Gauri's sworn brother\n\n===Guests===\n*[[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Mohini \u2013 Aditya's ex-girlfriend, a mentally-disturbed girl who seeks revenge and for that hijacked Rudra's flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.com/showbiz/dil-boley-oberoi-sara-khan-enters-ishqbaazs-spin-off-version-as-mentally-disturbed-character-1843916/|title=Dil Boley Oberoi: Sara Khan enters Ishqbaaz\u2019s spin-off version as mentally disturbed character|last=|first=|date=|website=India|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n*[[Nidhi Uttam]] as Jhanvi Thakur \u2013 Kali Thakur's late wife, Committed Suicide by burning her alive.\n*Sehrish Ali as Maya \u2013 Svetlana's assistant who on Svetlana's orders faked herself as a ghost to drive away Omkara's attention from Svetlana's actions.\n*Mrinmai Kolwalkar as The real identity of fake Svetlana kapoor, who had taken up the face of real Svetlana by first resorting to a mask and then, by Plastic Surgery.\n*Rakesh Srivastav as Mr. Dhurandhar \u2013 A court official hired by \"Biggest Aunt\" to bring Omkara-Gauri close to each other, for the success of her mission to get Omkara's son and raise him as her dead son, Ratan.\n*Unknown as Dr. Dang \u2013 He was the only one who knew about Svetlana's surgery because he was the surgeon.

It consists of bite-sized pieces of chicken, coated and fried with flour and seasoning mixture. Salt and pepper is the staple condiment, while [[Paprika|chili powder]], lightly fried [[basil]] leaves, and garlic bits are added for preference. Since the creation of this dish, it has become a popular fast food or restaurant appetizer in other countries in Asia, as well as among Asian immigrant populations overseas.\n\n==Origins==\nTaiwanese fried chicken is famous in its taste and texture, breaks through the confinement of the other snacks, having a high status in the street food space. It then rapidly becomes prevalent in the street and night markets.\n\nDespite the fact that the history of fried chicken is not long, it evolves a lot to overcome the competitiveness and so more choices and preferences have been released. In the early stage, the fried chicken is merely added with chili powder to separate into mild, medium spicy, and extra spicy three flavors. It varies with the time and uses other seasonings, such as allspice, seaweed powder, mustard powder etc. for flavoring or pickles it with honey or filling cheese inside.\n\nApart from using a pot of oil, it uses two pots of oil with high and low temperatures to fry the chickens in order to optimize the crunchy texture and taste nowadays. Some vendors grill the chicken first, then fry it for extra crunch. It uses the oil with high temperature to fry the chicken to lock its gravy, followed by the oil with low temperature to make it cooked. Using this method can eliminate the shortcoming of using just a pot of oil, which are either not fully cooked or overcooked leading to losing of the gravy and dry texture. Since frying the chickens with a pot of oil always result of a thick layer of fried flour and thin layer of meat, using the new method can avoid this from happening.\n\nBesides, some sellers use the subcutaneous fat of chickens as oil to fry the chicken, it can make the fried chickens smell good and less greasy. However, the cost of it is high. Therefore, only a few people will use this method. The famous news recently about the Taiwanese Fried Chicken are Henry Cheng Kar-Shun and the Professor Sung Selling Fried Chicken. It is unpredictable and interesting that they can be well known because of the fried chicken.\n\n== Popularity in Hong Kong ==\nHong Kong and Taiwan have close ties and people travel a lot between the two places, hence the products have long been well known among Hong Kong people. This loyalty means that Hong Kong is a big market for Taiwanese food. It is crucial to bring to Hong Kong customers the authentic Taiwanese fried chicken, with high-quality of ingredients. There are some famous brand selling Taiwanese food in Hong Kong, such as the Hot Star Large Fried Chicken and Ji Guang.[3] In 2016, the Hot Star Large Fried Chicken has the largest market share of this industry with 15 branches. [4]\n\n==Traditional preparation==\nIn general, only diced chicken leg or thigh meat is used and is marinated in soy sauce, sugar, garlic spread, rice wine, [[five-spice powder]] and spices powder for at least an hour. After marinating, chicken is dipped in beaten egg and then dredged in flour or sweet potato starch. Oil needs to be heated to 180 degrees (C) and when the oil is hot, the chicken can be added. It is fried until the surface color turns soft yellow and then it is ready to serve. Traditionally, after the chicken is fried, more pepper is added before eating.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Chicken (food)]]\n*[[Deep frying]]\n*[[Barbecue chicken]]\n*[[Karaage]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Jennings, R.

It then rapidly becomes prevalent in the street and night markets.\n\nDespite the fact that the history of fried chicken is not long, it evolves a lot to overcome the competitiveness and so more choices and preferences have been released. In the early stage, the fried chicken is merely added with chili powder to separate into mild, medium spicy, and extra spicy three flavors. It varies with the time and uses other seasonings, such as allspice, seaweed powder, mustard powder etc. for flavoring or pickles it with honey or filling cheese inside.\n\nApart from using a pot of oil, it uses two pots of oil with high and low temperatures to fry the chickens in order to optimize the crunchy texture and taste nowadays. Some vendors grill the chicken first, then fry it for extra crunch. It uses the oil with high temperature to fry the chicken to lock its gravy, followed by the oil with low temperature to make it cooked. Using this method can eliminate the shortcoming of using just a pot of oil, which are either not fully cooked or overcooked leading to losing of the gravy and dry texture. Since frying the chickens with a pot of oil always result of a thick layer of fried flour and thin layer of meat, using the new method can avoid this from happening.\n\nBesides, some sellers use the subcutaneous fat of chickens as oil to fry the chicken, it can make the fried chickens smell good and less greasy. However, the cost of it is high. Therefore, only a few people will use this method. The famous news recently about the Taiwanese Fried Chicken are Henry Cheng Kar-Shun and the Professor Sung Selling Fried Chicken. It is unpredictable and interesting that they can be well-known because of the fried chicken.\n\n== Popularity in Hong Kong ==\nHong Kong and Taiwan have close ties and people travel a lot between the two places, hence the products have long been well known among Hong Kong people. This loyalty means that Hong Kong is a big market for Taiwanese food. It is crucial to bring to Hong Kong customers the authentic Taiwanese fried chicken, with high-quality of ingredients. There are some famous brand selling Taiwanese food in Hong Kong, such as the Hot Star Large Fried Chicken and Ji Guang.[3] In 2016, the Hot Star Large Fried Chicken has the largest market share of this industry with 15 branches. [4]\n\n==Traditional preparation==\nIn general, only diced chicken leg or thigh meat is used and is marinated in soy sauce, sugar, garlic spread, rice wine, [[five-spice powder]] and spices powder for at least an hour. After marinating, chicken is dipped in beaten egg and then dredged in flour or sweet potato starch. Oil needs to be heated to 180 degrees (C) and when the oil is hot, the chicken can be added. It is fried until the surface color turns soft yellow and then it is ready to serve. Traditionally, after the chicken is fried, more pepper is added before eating.\n\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Chicken (food)]]\n*[[Deep frying]]\n*[[Barbecue chicken]]\n*[[Karaage]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Jennings, R.
