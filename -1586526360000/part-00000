He is a pioneer in the Icelandic art scene and art education. He has been called \u201cThe crusader of the painting\u201d,<ref>[[Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0]] article ''19.8 2005 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref> due to his involvement in those conflicts many Icelandic painters have had with the public fine art centers over the last 20&nbsp;years.\n\n== Early life ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Around the golden calf. tryptich.jpg|thumb|left|Einar H\u00e1konarson. ''Around the golden calf'', 2005 ''[[triptych]]''.]] -->\nEinar H\u00e1konarson was raised in Kleppsholt, Reykjav\u00edk. He started to paint and draw at a very young age. His father was a part-time artist and his 2 uncles were avid art lovers which was uncommon at that time in Iceland.\nEinar was only 15&nbsp;years old when he was accepted to The National Art School of Iceland. There he received his education for the next 4&nbsp;years following which he went abroad to [[Gothenburg]] [[Sweden]] and to study at [[Valand School of Fine Arts]] where he received influence from new modes of art and was influenced by figurative painting.<ref>[[Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0]] article ''7.6 1966'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part4.pdf</ref>\nWhilst Einar was still studying in Sweden he won the [[Nordic countries]] art prize after an exhibition in the [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].<ref>Handels Tindningen ''15.12 1966'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part3.pdf</ref> He won a prize in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], for his [[printmaking]], and an international printmaking prize in [[Ljubljana]], former [[Yugoslavia]], for a series of pictures after a trip to the German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in [[Poland]].<ref>Morgunbladid http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part2.pdf.</ref>\n\n== Art ==\n[[File:Laxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Halld\u00f3r Laxness portrait by Einar H\u00e1konarson]]\nEinar returned to Iceland after his education and held his first solo exhibition in Bogasalur Reykjav\u00edk 1968. His show distinguished itself from its Icelandic art scene then current as Einar's paintings were [[Pop art|pop]], [[figurative art|figurative]] and [[expressionistic]]. This exhibition brought the figure back into the Icelandic painting, which had been dominated by the abstract art for years.<ref>Visir ''23.3 1968'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part1.pdf.</ref>\n\nEinar has always been consistent in his art and his values. He paints in [[oil on canvas]] but also works with other mediums like [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[stained glass]], [[enamel paint|enamels]] and [[mosaic]]. The human in its environment has been a visible thread through his 40&nbsp;year career. Einar claims that he gets more influenced by feeling for nature, rather than by trying to paint a specific part of it.<ref>[RUV] Icelandic state TV ''interview 1976 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media.html. .</ref>\nIn his work can be seen different kinds of focus, for example on city life and the modern family unit. He has done a series about The [[Icelandic sagas]], [[the Holocaust]] and [[communism]], to name but a few.<ref>Morgunbladid ''17.5 2003'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf</ref> Religious themes are common in Einar\u2019s art and he frequently makes pictures from the Bible.<ref>[RUV] Icelandic state ''TV interview. http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media.html.</ref>\n\nIn later years Einar\u2019s painting style has become loosed from the strict style at the beginning of his career, but without having abandoned a disciplined [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Apart from Iceland, Einar has lived in Sweden (7&nbsp;years on and off) and for shorter periods in USA, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Einar is one of the principal [[portrait]] painters in Iceland. He has painted some of the most influential people of the nation, from politicians to national poets and artists.<ref>Morgunbladid ''4.10 2003'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf</ref> His work can be found in large numbers in official buildings, for example schools, banks, churches and the Icelandic parliament. Einar has held over 30 solo exhibitions and numerous group exhibitions.\n\n=== Printmaking ===\n\nEinar has won international awards for his printmaking. He was the first Icelandic artist to exhibit only printmaking in an art show (1968) and to publish printmaking folders ([[Icelandic sagas]]).<ref>(Morgunbladid ''17. 11 1968'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part4.pdf</ref> He was a driving force in founding The Icelandic Printmaking Association in 1969 and its first president.<ref>The Icelandic Printmakers Association ''{{cite web |url=http://www.islenskgrafik.is/page1/page15/page15.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033555/http://www.islenskgrafik.is/page1/page15/page15.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> Later Einar founded the printmaking department in The National Art School (MH\u00cd) when he became its director. Einar has also decorated numerous books with his printmaking.<ref>Morgunbladid ''13.5 1989'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-80s-part1.pdf.</ref>\n\n=== Teaching ===\nEinar was only 21&nbsp;years old when he started teaching in the National Art School of Iceland. He grew a beard, since he was younger than most of his students, and has kept it ever since. Einar founded an art school in 1970 (Mynds\u00fdn) with his colleague Ingiberg Magn\u00fasson.<ref>Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ubla\u00f0i\u00f0 ''12. 9 1970'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part4.pdf</ref> Einar was appointed director of The National Art school of Iceland in 1978, then 33&nbsp;years of age. He founded the department of printmaking and the department of sculpture, which did not exist in Iceland before and reconstructed the department of [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].<ref>Morgunbladid ''17.9 1978'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part1.pdf</ref> Einar has held many art [[workshop]]s and [[seminar]]s through his career. He held teaching positions in Sweden, [[Valand School of Fine Arts]] (1964\u20131967), [[Hovedskou art School]] (1989\u20131991) and [[Domens Art School]] (2000\u20132002).\n\n== The painters' conflict ==\nIn the 1990s, painters in Iceland became discontent with the public exhibition rooms. They felt that the painting was totally left out in the Icelandic art world, and the directors of the National galleries only focused on conceptual art. The painting was even declared dead by some of the country\u2019s [[art historians]].<ref>Morgunbladid ''7.9 2002'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-90s-part1.pdf.</ref> Einar said Icelandic painters had not had a public place to show their work in 20&nbsp;years.<ref>Morgunbladid ''1.11 1991'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-90s-part5.pdf.</ref> Einar, who previously was the artistic counselor of the City Museum ([[Kjarvalstadir]]), became the most energetic spokesman of the Icelandic painting and its right of existence in the Public museums, to this date.<ref>Morgunbladid ''11.2 2006'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf.</ref>\n\n== The Art Center ==\nIn 1997 Einar H\u00e1konarson built, the first private owned cultural center in Iceland. The Art Center (Listaskalinn in Hveragerdi) was a 1000&nbsp;square meters multi-cultural center, with the main focus on fine art and the art Einar felt was left out in the public art centers.<ref>Morgunbladid ''19.8 1997 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-90s-part3.pdf.</ref>\nThe Art Center produced over 20 exhibitions of paintings and sculptures, together with numerous concerts, theater performances, poetry and book readings. Some of the exhibitions were the most attended in Iceland\u2019s fine art history to date. Einar said \u201dFinally there is a place for painters and other artists who do not fit into the governmental art, run by its long lasting directors\u201d.\nBut the pioneering drive could not cope with the loan system of its time, or politics. The Art Center went under after 2 active years.<ref>Bladid ''11.2 2006'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Loss of the Art Center ===\n\nThe loss of the Art Center was bigger than most people know. Iceland\u2019s biggest art collector [[Sonja Sorillo]] wanted to get The Art Center to house 100 of her collected art works, including works of Picasso, Matisse, Bacon, De Kooning and Pollock. That fell through when The Art Center was sold in an auction to [[The West Nordic Fund]]. No international art collection exists in Iceland like Mrs. Sorillo's. Her collection was broken up and sold abroad after her death. The Art Center was then sold to The Arnesinga Art Museum (Museum of the region) who had previously declined any collaboration with H\u00e1konarson\u2019s Art Center.<ref>Morgunbladid ''article : Mannl\u00edfid i allri sinni mynd'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf\n</ref>\n\n=== The Painters House ===\n\nEinar lost his home and all of his possessions with the downfall of The Art Center. But he stood up after being knocked down and started The Painters House in 2002, a non profitable exhibition place with co painter [[Haukur Dor]]. Later, another painter, [[Oli G]] took Dor's place and 19 exhibitions were made in two years.<ref>Morgunbladid http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf</ref>\n\nEinar opened an unusual exhibition in the so-called \u201cCultural night\u201d in Reykjav\u00edk 2005. He put up 600&nbsp;square meters tents and showed 90 paintings in the city centers park, to demonstrate the exclusion of the painting in the public art centers for the last 20&nbsp;years. He called the show \u201cIn the Grass Root\u201d.<ref>Morgunbladid ''20.8 2005'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref> What followed is unheard of in the Icelandic art history. 3000 people (1% of the country\u2019s population) attended the exhibition in one day and showed their support in Einar and the Icelandic painting. After this show, Icelandic painters formed a group to push for more democracy in the Public art world. This struggle continues to date.<ref>Morgunbladid ''20.9 2005'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref>\n\n== Cultural scene ==\nEinar has held various prominent positions in the Icelandic art world, where he has been active in promoting Icelandic art nationally and internationally.<ref>Morgunbladid ''19.7 1987'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-80s-part2.pdf</ref> He was the artistic counselor of Kjarvalstadir, The City Gallery of Reykjav\u00edk 1987\u20131988 and a chairman of many exhibition committees. He designed and directed the exhibition of The History of Iceland, on Iceland\u2019s 1100 birthday in 1974.<ref>Morgunbladid ''10.10 1974'' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part2.pdf</ref> He was a deputy to the mayor in the governing body of the [[H\u00e4sselby Slott]], cultural site of the Nordic capital cities 1982\u20131992.\n\nEinar H\u00e1konarson lives in [[H\u00f3lmav\u00edk]] with his wife Solveig Hjalmarsdottir.

There he received his education for the next 4&nbsp;years following which he went abroad to [[Gothenburg]] [[Sweden]] and to study at [[Valand School of Fine Arts]] where he received influence from new modes of art and was influenced by figurative painting.<ref>[[Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0]] article ''7.6 1966 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part4.pdf</ref>\nWhilst Einar was still studying in Sweden he won the [[Nordic countries]] art prize after an exhibition in the [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].<ref>Handels Tindningen ''15.12 1966 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part3.pdf</ref> He won a prize in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], for his [[printmaking]], and an international printmaking prize in [[Ljubljana]], former [[Yugoslavia]], for a series of pictures after a trip to the German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in [[Poland]].<ref>Morgunbladid http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part2.pdf.</ref>\n\n== Art ==\n[[File:Laxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Halld\u00f3r Laxness portrait by Einar H\u00e1konarson]]\nEinar returned to Iceland after his education and held his first solo exhibition in Bogasalur Reykjav\u00edk 1968. His show distinguished itself from its Icelandic art scene then current as Einar's paintings were [[Pop art|pop]], [[figurative art|figurative]] and [[expressionistic]]. This exhibition brought the figure back into the Icelandic painting, which had been dominated by the abstract art for years.<ref>Visir ''23.3 1968 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-60s-part1.pdf.</ref>\n\nEinar has always been consistent in his art and his values. He paints in [[oil on canvas]] but also works with other mediums like [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[stained glass]], [[enamel paint|enamels]] and [[mosaic]]. The human in its environment has been a visible thread through his 40&nbsp;year career. Einar claims that he gets more influenced by feeling for nature, rather than by trying to paint a specific part of it.<ref>[RUV] Icelandic state TV ''interview 1976 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media.html. .</ref>\nIn his work can be seen different kinds of focus, for example on city life and the modern family unit. He has done a series about The [[Icelandic sagas]], [[the Holocaust]] and [[communism]], to name but a few.<ref>Morgunbladid ''17.5 2003 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf</ref> Religious themes are common in Einar\u2019s art and he frequently makes pictures from the Bible.<ref>[RUV] Icelandic state ''TV interview. http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media.html.</ref>\n\nIn later years Einar\u2019s painting style has become loosed from the strict style at the beginning of his career, but without having abandoned a disciplined [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Apart from Iceland, Einar has lived in Sweden (7&nbsp;years on and off) and for shorter periods in USA, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Einar is one of the principal [[portrait]] painters in Iceland. He has painted some of the most influential people of the nation, from politicians to national poets and artists.<ref>Morgunbladid ''4.10 2003 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf</ref> His work can be found in large numbers in official buildings, for example schools, banks, churches and the Icelandic parliament. Einar has held over 30 solo exhibitions and numerous group exhibitions.\n\n=== Printmaking ===\n\nEinar has won international awards for his printmaking. He was the first Icelandic artist to exhibit only printmaking in an art show (1968) and to publish printmaking folders ([[Icelandic sagas]]).<ref>(Morgunbladid ''17. 11 1968 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part4.pdf</ref> He was a driving force in founding The Icelandic Printmaking Association in 1969 and its first president.<ref>The Icelandic Printmakers Association ''{{cite web |url=http://www.islenskgrafik.is/page1/page15/page15.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033555/http://www.islenskgrafik.is/page1/page15/page15.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> Later Einar founded the printmaking department in The National Art School (MH\u00cd) when he became its director. Einar has also decorated numerous books with his printmaking.<ref>Morgunbladid ''13.5 1989 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-80s-part1.pdf.</ref>\n\n=== Teaching ===\nEinar was only 21&nbsp;years old when he started teaching in the National Art School of Iceland. He grew a beard, since he was younger than most of his students, and has kept it ever since. Einar founded an art school in 1970 (Mynds\u00fdn) with his colleague Ingiberg Magn\u00fasson.<ref>Al\u00fe\u00fd\u00f0ubla\u00f0i\u00f0 ''12. 9 1970 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part4.pdf</ref> Einar was appointed director of The National Art school of Iceland in 1978, then 33&nbsp;years of age. He founded the department of printmaking and the department of sculpture, which did not exist in Iceland before and reconstructed the department of [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].<ref>Morgunbladid ''17.9 1978 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part1.pdf</ref> Einar has held many art [[workshop]]s and [[seminar]]s through his career. He held teaching positions in Sweden, [[Valand School of Fine Arts]] (1964\u20131967), [[Hovedskou art School]] (1989\u20131991) and [[Domens Art School]] (2000\u20132002).\n\n== The painters' conflict ==\nIn the 1990s, painters in Iceland became discontent with the public exhibition rooms. They felt that the painting was totally left out in the Icelandic art world, and the directors of the National galleries only focused on conceptual art. The painting was even declared dead by some of the country\u2019s [[art historians]].<ref>Morgunbladid ''7.9 2002 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-90s-part1.pdf.</ref> Einar said Icelandic painters had not had a public place to show their work in 20&nbsp;years.<ref>Morgunbladid ''1.11 1991 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-90s-part5.pdf.</ref> Einar, who previously was the artistic counselor of the City Museum ([[Kjarvalstadir]]), became the most energetic spokesman of the Icelandic painting and its right of existence in the Public museums, to this date.<ref>Morgunbladid ''11.2 2006 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf.</ref>\n\n== The Art Center ==\nIn 1997 Einar H\u00e1konarson built, the first private owned cultural center in Iceland. The Art Center (Listaskalinn in Hveragerdi) was a 1000&nbsp;square meters multi-cultural center, with the main focus on fine art and the art Einar felt was left out in the public art centers.<ref>Morgunbladid ''19.8 1997 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-90s-part3.pdf.</ref>\nThe Art Center produced over 20 exhibitions of paintings and sculptures, together with numerous concerts, theater performances, poetry and book readings. Some of the exhibitions were the most attended in Iceland\u2019s fine art history to date. Einar said \u201dFinally there is a place for painters and other artists who do not fit into the governmental art, run by its long lasting directors\u201d.\nBut the pioneering drive could not cope with the loan system of its time, or politics. The Art Center went under after 2 active years.<ref>Bladid ''11.2 2006 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Loss of the Art Center ===\n\nThe loss of the Art Center was bigger than most people know. Iceland\u2019s biggest art collector [[Sonja Sorillo]] wanted to get The Art Center to house 100 of her collected art works, including works of Picasso, Matisse, Bacon, De Kooning and Pollock. That fell through when The Art Center was sold in an auction to [[The West Nordic Fund]]. No international art collection exists in Iceland like Mrs. Sorillo's. Her collection was broken up and sold abroad after her death. The Art Center was then sold to The Arnesinga Art Museum (Museum of the region) who had previously declined any collaboration with H\u00e1konarson\u2019s Art Center.<ref>Morgunbladid ''article : Mannl\u00edfid i allri sinni mynd http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf\n</ref>\n\n=== The Painters House ===\n\nEinar lost his home and all of his possessions with the downfall of The Art Center. But he stood up after being knocked down and started The Painters House in 2002, a non profitable exhibition place with co painter [[Haukur Dor]]. Later, another painter, [[Oli G]] took Dor's place and 19 exhibitions were made in two years.<ref>Morgunbladid '' http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part1.pdf</ref>\n\nEinar opened an unusual exhibition in the so-called \u201cCultural night\u201d in Reykjav\u00edk 2005. He put up 600&nbsp;square meters tents and showed 90 paintings in the city centers park, to demonstrate the exclusion of the painting in the public art centers for the last 20&nbsp;years. He called the show \u201cIn the Grass Root\u201d.<ref>Morgunbladid ''20.8 2005 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref> What followed is unheard of in the Icelandic art history. 3000 people (1% of the country\u2019s population) attended the exhibition in one day and showed their support in Einar and the Icelandic painting. After this show, Icelandic painters formed a group to push for more democracy in the Public art world. This struggle continues to date.<ref>Morgunbladid ''20.9 2005 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-2000-part2.pdf</ref>\n\n== Cultural scene ==\nEinar has held various prominent positions in the Icelandic art world, where he has been active in promoting Icelandic art nationally and internationally.<ref>Morgunbladid ''19.7 1987 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-80s-part2.pdf</ref> He was the artistic counselor of Kjarvalstadir, The City Gallery of Reykjav\u00edk 1987\u20131988 and a chairman of many exhibition committees. He designed and directed the exhibition of The History of Iceland, on Iceland\u2019s 1100 birthday in 1974.<ref>Morgunbladid ''10.10 1974 http://www.einarhakonarson.com/media/articles-70s-part2.pdf</ref> He was a deputy to the mayor in the governing body of the [[H\u00e4sselby Slott]], cultural site of the Nordic capital cities 1982\u20131992.\n\nEinar H\u00e1konarson lives in [[H\u00f3lmav\u00edk]] with his wife Solveig Hjalmarsdottir.
