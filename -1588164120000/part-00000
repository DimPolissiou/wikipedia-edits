The best team in each Pool advances to the final. All pool games must be decided by a win, there are no ties. If a pool has a three-way tie for 1st (all teams have 1-1 records) than GF/GA differential among the tied teams is the first tie-breaker.\n\nThe UNB Varsity Reds advanced to the finals for the third straight year and won their second title in two years, having won in 2007 (Moncton).\n\n==Road to the Cup==\n\n===AUS playoffs===\n{{6TeamBracket \n|RD1=Quarter-finals (Best of 3)\n|RD2=Semi-finals (Best of 5)\n|RD3=AUS Championship (Best of 5)\n\n|RD1-seed1=4\n|RD1-team1=[[St. Francis Xavier X-Men]]\n|RD1-score1=0\n|RD1-seed2=5\n|RD1-team2='''[[Acadia Axemen]]'''\n|RD1-score2='''2'''\n\n|RD1-seed3=3\n|RD1-team3='''[[Moncton Aigles Bleus]]'''\n|RD1-score3='''2'''\n|RD1-seed4=6\n|RD1-team4=[[UPEI Panthers]]\n|RD1-score4=1\n\n|RD2-seed1=1\n|RD2-team1='''[[UNB Varsity Reds]]'''\n|RD2-score1='''3'''\n|RD2-seed2=5\n|RD2-team2=Acadia Axemen\n|RD2-score2=0\n\n|RD2-seed3=2\n|RD2-team3='''[[Saint Mary's Huskies]]'''\n|RD2-score3=3\n|RD2-seed4=3\n|RD2-team4=Moncton Aigles Bleus\n|RD2-score4=1\n\n|RD3-seed1=1\n|RD3-team1=UNB Varsity Reds\n|RD3-score1=1\n|RD3-seed2=2\n|RD3-team2='''Saint Mary's Huskies'''\n|RD3-score2='''2'''\n}}\n\n===OUA Playoffs===\nThe 2009 OUA hockey Conference had two(2) Divisions broken-up further into two(2) Groups each for a total of four(4) Groups; Far-East, Mid-East, Mid-West and Far-West.

The wild-card team was selected from the AUS Conference as the CW was provided the wild-card in 2008 and OUA teams are ineligible as they are the host conference. With Lakehead losing in the first round of the playoffs, they are a natural 'host' and are the 6th seed.\n\nRanking is based on the last Top 10 media release for the season, February 17, well before the end of the playoffs. The Ranking Committee provides the Tournament Committee with a 6-team mini-ranking prior to the tournament which is then used for seeding.

Being one of the most determinative events in Hungary's modern history, it is also one of the cornerstones of the Hungarian national identity. The crucial turning point of the events were the [[April laws]] which were ratified by King [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], however the new young Austrian monarch [[Franz Joseph I]] arbitrarily revoked the laws without any legal competence. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Franz Joseph. The new constrained [[Stadion Constitution]] of Austria, the revocation of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny government]] (who searched agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s followers in the parliament, who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total [[independence]] from the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nAfter a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the Austrian Empire came close to the brink of collapse. The young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>Eric Roman: Austria-Hungary & the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present -PAGE: 67, Publisher: Infobase Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|9780816074693}}</ref> Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] answered, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal [[martial law]].<ref>The Making of the West: Volume C, Lynn Hunt, Pages 683\u2013684</ref>\n\nThe anniversary of the Revolution's outbreak, 15 March, is one of Hungary's three [[Public holidays in Hungary|national holidays]].\n\n==Hungary before the Revolution==\nThe Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained a separate legal system and separate parliament, the [[Diet of Hungary]], even after the Austrian Empire was created in 1804.<ref> In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary.

Hungary's central government structures remained well separated from the imperial government. The country was governed by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) - located in [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] and later in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] - and by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna.<ref>\u00c9va H.

[[Ign\u00e1c Martinovics]] worked as a secret agent for the new Holy Roman Emperor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], until 1792. In his Oratio pro Leopoldo II, he explicitly declares that only authority derived from a [[social contract]] should be recognized; he saw the aristocracy as the enemy of mankind, because they prevented people from becoming educated. In another of his works, Catechism of People and Citizens, he argued that citizens tend to oppose any repression and that sovereignty resides with the people. He also became a Freemason, and was in favour of the adoption of a federal republic in Hungary. As a member of the Hungarian Jacobins, he was considered an idealistic forerunner of revolutionary thought by some, and an unscrupulous adventurer by others. He was in charge of stirring up a revolt against the nobility among the Hungarian serfs. For these subversive acts, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, dismissed Martinovics and his boss, Ferenc Gotthardi, the former chief of the secret police. He was executed, together with six other prominent Jacobins, in May 1795. More than 42 members of the republican secret society were arrested, including the poet [[J\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi]] and linguist [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]<ref>Charles W.

In the latter years of Francis I the dark shadow of Metternich's policy of \"stability\" fell across the kingdom, and the forces of reactionary absolutism were everywhere supreme. But beneath the surface a strong popular current was beginning to run in a contrary direction. Hungarian society, affected by western Liberalism, but without any direct help from abroad, was preparing for the future emancipation. Writers, savants, poets, artists, noble and plebeian, layman and cleric, without any previous concert, or obvious connection, were working towards that ideal of political liberty which was to unite all the Magyars. Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey, Ferencz Kazinczy and his associates, to mention but a few of many great names, were, consciously or unconsciously, as the representatives of the renascent national literature, accomplishing a political mission, and their pens proved no less efficacious than the swords of their ancestors.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1825 [[Emperor Francis II]] convened the Diet in response to growing concerns amongst the Hungarian nobility about taxes and the diminishing economy, after the Napoleonic wars. This \u2013 and the reaction to the reforms of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor#Ruling emperor<!-- see sub-chapter \"Reaction\" as well -->|Joseph II]] \u2013 started what is known as the Reform Period ({{lang-hu|reformkor}}).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} But the Nobles still retained their privileges of paying no taxes and not giving the vote to the masses.\n\nThe influential Hungarian politician Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] recognized the need to bring the country the advances of the more developed West European countries, such as England.\n\nIt was a direct attack upon the constitution which, to use the words of Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, first \"startled the nation out of its sickly drowsiness\". In 1823, when the reactionary powers were considering joint action to suppress the revolution in Spain, the government, without consulting the diet, imposed a war-tax and called out the recruits. The county assemblies instantly protested against this illegal act, and Francis I was obliged, at the diet of 1823, to repudiate the action of his ministers. But the estates felt that the maintenance of their liberties demanded more substantial guarantees than the dead letter of ancient laws. Sz\u00e9chenyi, who had resided abroad and studied Western institutions, was the recognized leader of all those who wished to create a new Hungary out of the old. For years he and his friends educated public opinion by issuing innumerable pamphlets in which the new Liberalism was eloquently expounded. In particular Sz\u00e9chenyi insisted that the people must not look exclusively to the government, or even to the diet, for the necessary reforms. Society itself must take the initiative by breaking down the barriers of class exclusiveness and reviving a healthy public spirit. The effect of this teaching was manifest at the diet of 1832, when the Liberals in the Lower Chamber had a large majority, prominent among whom were Ferenc De\u00e1k and \u00d6d\u00f6n Beothy. In the Upper House, however, the magnates united with the government to form a conservative party obstinately opposed to any project of reform, which frustrated all the efforts of the Liberals.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe new rising political star of the mid 1830s was [[Lajos Kossuth]], who started to rival with the popularity of Sz\u00e9chenyi due to his talent as orator in the liberal fraction of the parliament. Kossuth called for broader parliamentary democracy, rapid industrialization, general taxation, economic expansion through exports, and the abolition of serfdom and aristocratic privileges (equality before the law). The alarm of the government at the power and popularity of the Liberal party induced it, soon after the accession of the new king, the emperor Ferdinand I (1835\u20131848), to attempt to crush the reform movement by arresting and imprisoning the most active agitators among them, Lajos Kossuth and [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi]]. But the nation was no longer to be cowed. The diet of 1839 refused to proceed to business till the political prisoners had been released, and, while in the Lower Chamber the reforming majority was larger than ever, a Liberal party was now also formed in the Upper House under the leadership of Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny and Baron Joseph Eotvos. From 1000AD up to 1844, Latin language was the official language of administration, legislation and schooling in the Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Two progressive measures of the highest importance were passed by this diet, one making Magyar the official language of Hungary, the other freeing the peasants' holdings from all feudal obligations.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe results of the diet of 1839 did not satisfy the advanced Liberals, while the opposition of the government and of the Upper House still further embittered the general discontent. The chief exponent of this temper was the Pesti Hirlap, Hungary's first political newspaper, founded in 1841 by Kossuth, whose articles, advocating armed reprisals if necessary, inflamed the extremists but alienated Sz\u00e9chenyi, who openly attacked Kossuth's opinions. The polemic on both sides was violent; but, as usual, the extreme views prevailed, and on the assembling of the diet of 1843 Kossuth was more popular than ever, while the influence of Sz\u00e9chenyi had sensibly declined. The tone of this diet was passionate, and the government was fiercely attacked for interfering with the elections. A new party called as [[Opposition Party (Hungary)|Opposition party]] was created, which united the reform oriented Liberals, to oppose the conservatives. Fresh triumphs were won by the Liberals (the Opposition Party). Magyar was now declared to be the language of the schools and the law-courts as well as of the legislature; mixed marriages were legalized; and official positions were thrown open to non-nobles.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===\"Long debate\" of reformers in the press (1841\u20131848)===\nThe interval between the diet of 1843 and that of 1847 saw a complete disintegration and transformation of the various political parties. Sz\u00e9chenyi openly joined the government, while the moderate Liberals separated from the extremists and formed a new party, the Centralists. \n\n[[File:Pilvax Pest Preiszler.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The entrance room of the Pilvax coffee palace at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 1840s]]\n[[File:Pet\u0151fi Nemzeti M\u00fazeum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The recitation of the National Song at the National Museum]]\n[[File:A szabadsajt\u00f3 els\u0151 term\u00e9ke Pesten 1848. m\u00e1rcius 15.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The crowd captured the Landerer & Heckenast printing house, where they printed the 12 points and the National Song.

Sz\u00e9chenyi believed that economic, political and social reforms should proceed slowly and with care, in order to avoid the potentially disastrous prospect of violent interference from the Habsburg dynasty. Sz\u00e9chenyi was aware of the spread of Kossuth's ideas in Hungarian society, which he took to overlook the need for a good relationship with the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nKossuth, for his part, rejected the role of the aristocracy, and questioned established norms of social status. In contrast to Sz\u00e9chenyi, Kossuth believed that in the process of social reform it would be impossible to restrain civil society in a passive role. He warned against attempting to exclude wider social movements from political life, and supported democracy, rejecting the primacy of elites and the government. In 1885, he labeled Sz\u00e9chenyi a liberal elitist aristocrat, while Sz\u00e9chenyi considered Kossuth to be a democrat.<ref>Mih\u00e1ly Lack\u00f3: ''Sz\u00e9chenyi \u00e9s Kossuth vit\u00e1ja'', Gondolat, 1977.</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi was an isolationist politician, while Kossuth saw strong relations and collaboration with international liberal and progressive movements as essential for the success of liberty.<ref>See: Lacko p. 47</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi based his economic policy on the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' principles practiced by the [[British Empire]], while Kossuth supported protective tariffs due to the comparatively weak Hungarian industrial sector. While Kossuth envisioned the construction of a rapidly industrialized country, Sz\u00e9chenyi wanted to preserve the traditionally strong agricultural sector as the main characteristic of the economy.<ref>''Gr\u00f3f Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n \u00edr\u00f3i \u00e9s h\u00edrlapi vit\u00e1ja Kossuth Lajossal'' [Count Stephen Sz\u00e9chenyi,s Literary and Publicistic Debate with Louis Kossuth], ed.

This was also the last election which was based on the parliamentary system of the old feudal estates. All efforts to bring about an understanding between the government and the opposition were fruitless. Kossuth demanded not merely the redress of actual grievances, but a liberal reform which would make grievances impossible in the future. In the highest circles a dissolution of the diet now seemed to be the sole remedy; but, before it could be carried out, tidings of the February revolution in Paris reached Pressburg on the 1st of March, and on the 3rd of March Kossuth's motion for the appointment of an independent, responsible ministry was accepted by the Lower House. The moderates, alarmed not so much by the motion itself as by its tone, again tried to intervene; but on the 13th of March the Vienna revolution broke out, and the Emperor, yielding to pressure or panic, appointed Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny premier of the first Hungarian responsible ministry, which included Kossuth, Sz\u00e9chenyi and De\u00e1k.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hungary |volume=13 |pages=915\u2013918 |first1=Robert Nisbet |last1=Bain |first2=Walter Alison |last2=Phillips |inline=1}}</ref>\n\n==The bloodless revolution in Pest==\n{{further|12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848}}\n[[File:Magyar kok\u00e1rda.png|thumb|left|100px|The Hungarian [[cockade]] used in 1848]]\n\nThe crisis came from abroad - as Kossuth expected - and he used it to the full. On 3 March 1848, shortly after the news of the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in Paris]] had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, \"our beloved Archduke [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]]\" (then seventeen years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of [[Vienna]] to the mob by which [[Metternich]] was overthrown (13 March), and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. The arrival of the news of the revolution in Paris, and Kossuth's German speech about freedom and human rights had whipped up the passions of Austrian crowd in Vienna on March 13.<ref>Charles Frederick Henningsen: Kossuth and 'The Times', by the author of 'The revelations of Russia'. 1851 -PAGE: 10</ref>\nWhile Viennese masses celebrated Kossuth as their hero, revolution broke out in Buda on 15 March; Kossuth traveled home immediately.<ref>Peter F.

On the morning of March 15, 1848, revolutionaries marched around the city of Pest, reading [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]'s [[Nemzeti dal]] (National Song) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] (the twelve demands of theirs) to the crowd (which swelled to thousands). Declaring an end to all forms of censorship, they visited the printing presses of Landerer and Heckenast and printed Pet\u0151fi's poem together with the demands. A mass demonstration was held in front of the newly built National Museum, after which the group left for the Buda Chancellery (the Office of the Governor-General) on the other bank of the Danube.\n\nThe bloodless mass demonstrations in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Buda]] forced the Imperial governor to accept all twelve of their demands.\n\nAustria had its own problems with the [[Vienna Revolt|revolution in Vienna]] that year, and it initially acknowledged Hungary's government. Therefore, the Governor-General's officers, acting in the name of the King appointed Hungary's new parliament with [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny]] as its first Prime Minister. The Austrian monarchy also made other concessions{{Which|date=July 2011}} to subdue the Vienna masses: on 13 March 1848, Prince [[Klemens von Metternich]] was made to resign his position as the Austrian Government's Chancellor.

Hungary had, to all intents and purposes, become an independent state bound to Austria only by the Austrian Archduke as Palatine.<ref name=EB1911/> The new government approved a sweeping reform package, referred to as the \"[[April laws]]\", which created a democratic political system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dragon.unideb.hu/~kltegimn/CLASSES/12C/HTM/PZ/HU/APR21.HTM |title=''Az \u00e1prilisi t\u00f6rv\u00e9nyek'' (English: \"The April laws\") |language=Hungarian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=March 22, 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716180039/http://dragon.unideb.hu/~kltegimn/CLASSES/12C/HTM/PZ/HU/APR21.HTM |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref> The newly established government also demanded that the Habsburg Empire spend all taxes they received from Hungary in Hungary itself, and that the Parliament should have authority over the Hungarian regiments of the Habsburg Army.\n\nThe new suffrage law (Act V of 1848) transformed the old feudal estates based parliament ([[The Estates|Estates General]]) into a democratic representative parliament. This law offered the widest suffrage right in Europe at the time.<ref>prof.

The reform oriented political forces won the elections. The electoral system and franchise were similar to the contemporary British system.<ref>Steven A. Seidman and Peter Lang. ''Posters, Propaganda, and Persuasion in Election Campaigns Around the World''. p. 201</ref>\n\nAt that time the internal affairs and foreign policy of Hungary were not stable, and Batthy\u00e1ny faced many problems. His first and most important act was to organize the armed forces and the local governments. He insisted that the Austrian army, when in Hungary, would come under Hungarian law, and this was conceded by the Austrian Empire. He tried to repatriate conscript soldiers from Hungary. He established the [[Organisation of Militiamen]], whose job was to ensure internal security of the country.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny was a very capable leader, but he was stuck in the middle of a clash between the Austrian monarchy and the Hungarian separatists. He was devoted to the [[constitutional monarchy]] and aimed to keep the constitution, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with his work. \n\n[[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]] was [[Ban of Croatia|''Ban'' (Viceroy) of Croatia and Dalmatia]], regions included in the Kingdom of Hungary. He was opposed to the new Hungarian government, and raised troops in his domains.\n\nIn the summer of 1848, the Hungarian government, seeing the civil war ahead, tried to get the Habsburgs' support against Jela\u010di\u0107. They offered to send troops to northern Italy. In August 1848, the Imperial Government in Vienna officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest not to form an army.\n\nOn 29 August, with the assent of parliament, Batthy\u00e1ny  went with [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]] to the Emperor to ask him to order the Serbs to capitulate and stop Jela\u010di\u0107, who was going to attack Hungary. But Jela\u010di\u0107 went ahead and invaded Hungary to dissolve the Hungarian government, without any order from Austria.\n\nThough the Emperor formally relieved Jela\u010di\u0107 of his duties, Jela\u010di\u0107 and his army invaded [[Me\u0111imurje (region)|Murak\u00f6z (Me\u0111imurje)]] and the Southern [[Transdanubia]]n parts of Hungary on 11 September 1848.\n\nAfter the Austrian revolution in Vienna was defeated, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] replaced his uncle [[Ferdinand I of Austria]], who was not of sound mind. Franz Joseph didn't recognise Batthy\u00e1ny's second premiership, which began on 25 September. Also, Franz Joseph was not recognized as \"King of Hungary\" by the Hungarian parliament, and he was not crowned as \"King of Hungary\" until 1867. In the end, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field-Marshal [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] was given control of every army in Hungary (including Jela\u010di\u0107's). He went to Hungary where he was mobbed and viciously murdered. Following his murder the Imperial court dissolved the Hungarian Diet and appointed Jela\u010di\u0107 as Regent.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, Batthy\u00e1ny travelled again to Vienna to seek a compromise with the new Emperor. His efforts remained unsuccessful, because Franz Joseph refused to accept the reform laws. This was an unconstitutional deed, because the laws were already signed by his uncle, and the monarch had no right to revoke laws which were already signed.\n\nHungarian liberals in Pest saw this as an opportunity. In September 1848, the Diet made concessions to the Pest Uprising, so as not to break up the Austro-Hungarian Union. But the counter-revolutionary forces were gathering. After many{{Quantify|date=January 2014}} local victories, the combined Bohemian and Croatian armies entered Pest on 5 January 1849.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gazi |title=A History of Croatia |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |place=New York |year=1973 |page=150}}</ref>\n\nSo Batthy\u00e1ny and his government resigned, except for Kossuth, Szemere, and M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros. Later, on [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Palatine Stephen]]'s request, Batthy\u00e1ny became Prime Minister again. On 13 September Batthy\u00e1ny announced a rebellion and requested that the Palatine lead them. However the Palatine, under the Emperor's orders, resigned and left Hungary.\n\nHungary now had war raging on three fronts: Jela\u010di\u0107's [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian]] troops to the South, [[Hungarians in Romania|Romanians]] in [[Banat]] and in [[Transylvania]] to the East, and Austria to the west.\n\nThe Hungarian government was in serious military crisis due to the lack of soldiers, therefore they sent Kossuth (a brilliant orator) to recruit volunteers for the new Hungarian army. While Jela\u010di\u0107 was marching on Pest, Kossuth went from town to town rousing the people to the defense of the country, and the popular force of the Honv\u00e9d was his creation.\n\nWith the help of Kossuth's recruiting speeches, Batthy\u00e1ny quickly formed the [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]]. The new Hungarian army defeated the Croatians on 29 September at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]].\n\nThe battle became an icon for the Hungarian army for its effect on politics and morale. Kossuth's second letter for the Austrian people and this battle were the causes of the second revolution in Vienna on 6 October.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny slowly realized that he could not reach his main goal, peaceful compromise with the Habsburg dynasty. On 2 October he resigned and simultaneously resigned his seat in parliament.

The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur G\u00f6rgey in particular, whose abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of G\u00f6rgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others.\n\nDuring all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat at the Battle of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent J\u00f3zef Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr [[William Henry Stiles]] (1808\u20131865), the American envoy. Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and the Hungarian government \u2013 set up lawfully on the basis of the April laws. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, Kossuth issued the celebrated Hungarian Declaration of Independence, in which he declared that \"the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.\" It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. The dethronement also made any compromise with the Habsburgs practically impossible.\n\nKossuth played a key role in tying down the Hungarian army for weeks for the siege and recapture of Buda castle, finally successful on 21 May 1849. The hopes of ultimate success were, however, frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and on 11 August Kossuth abdicated in favor of G\u00f6rgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the general alone could save the nation. G\u00f6rgey capitulated at Vil\u00e1gos (now \u015eiria, Romania) to the Russians, who handed over the army to the Austrians.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==War of Independence==\n[[File:Buda ostroma 1849. m\u00e1jus 21.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Siege of Buda (1849)|Siege of Buda]] in May 1849]]\nIn 1848 and 1849, the [[Hungarian people]] or Magyars, who wanted independence, formed a majority only in the central areas of the country.

In 1804 the semi-independent [[Principality of Serbia]] had formed south of the Danube with Belgrade as its capital. So in 1849, the Danube divided Serbia from the Kingdom of Hungary. The Hungarian district on the northern side of the river was called \"[[Vojvodina]]\", and by that time it was home to almost half a million Serbian inhabitants. According to the [[Demographic history of Vojvodina#1840|census of 1840 in Vojvodina]] Serbs comprised 49% of the total population. The Serbs of Vojvodina had sought their independence or attachment with the [[Principality of Serbia]] on the other side of the Danube. In face of the emerging Hungarian independence movement leading up to the 1848 Revolution the Austrian monarchy had promised an independent status for the Serbs of Vojvodina within the Austrian Empire.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nToward this end, [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] was appointed Patriarch of Vojvodina in February 1849.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=613}}  Raja\u010di\u0107 was a supporter of the Serbian national movement, although somewhat conservative with pro-Austrian leanings. At a crucial point during the war against the Hungarian Government, in late March 1849 when the Austrians needed more Serbian soldiers to fight the war, the Austrian General [[Georg Rukavina Baron von Vidovgrad]], who commanded the Austrian troops in Hungary, officially re-stated this promise of independence for Vojvodina and conceded to all the demands of the Patriarch regarding Serbian nationhood.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=250|loc=The War in Hungary}}  Acquiescence to the demands of the Patriarch should have meant a relaxation of the strict military administration of Vojvodina. Under this military administration in the border areas, any male between the ages of 16 years and 60 years of age could be conscripted into the army.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}\n\nThe Serbs of Vojvodina were expecting their requirement for Austrian military conscription to be the first measure to be relaxed. But the new Emperor Franz Joseph had other ideas and this promise was broken not more than two weeks after it had been made to the people of Vojvodina. This caused a split in the population of the Vojvodina and at least part of the Serbs in that province began to support the elected Hungarian Government against the Austrians{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}. Some Serbs sought to ingratiate the Serb nation with the Austrian Empire to promote the independence of Vojvodina.\n\nWith war on three fronts the Hungarian Government should have been squashed immediately{{According to whom|date=January 2014}} upon the start of hostilities. However, events early in the war worked in favor of the Government. The unity of the Serbs on the southern front was ruined by Austrian perfidy over the legal status of Vojvodina.\n\nSome right-wing participants in the Serbian national movement felt that a \"revolution\" in Hungary more threatened the prerogatives of landowners, and the nobles in Serbian Vojvodina, than the occupying Austrians.{{sfn|Judah|1997|p=60}}\n\n[[File:Than tapiobicskei utk\u00f6zet2 1849 aprilis 4.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Battle at [[T\u00e1pi\u00f3bicske]] (4 April 1849) by [[M\u00f3r Than]]]]\nAt the start of the war, the Hungarian Defence Forces (''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g]]'') won some {{Quantify|date=January 2014}} battles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331|title=P\u00e1kozd-Sukor\u00f3 Battle 1848 Exhibition|language=Hungarian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=P\u00e1kozd |date=September 29, 1998 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728185918/http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331|archivedate=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1hungary.com/info/isaszeg/ |title=Isaszeg |work=1hungary.com |accessdate=2 July 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061715/http://www.1hungary.com/info/isaszeg/ |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> against the Austrians, for example at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]] in September 1848 and at the [[Battle of Isaszeg (1849)|Isaszeg]] in April 1849, at which time they even stated the [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] from the Habsburg Empire.

However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to [[Magyarization|Magyarize]] the Slovak region under Hungarian control. The aim of this was to bring the varied ethnic groups around Hungary into a common culture. At the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution this process was seen as more imminent and threatening to ethnic groups, especially the Slovaks.<ref name=slovak>\u0160piesz, Anton (2006), Illustrated Slovak History, Wauconda, Illinois: Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, {{ISBN|0-86516-500-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Slovaks made demands that their culture be spared Magyarization and that they be given certain liberties and rights. These demands soon broke out into demonstrations clamouring for the rights of ethnic minorities in Hungary. Arrests were made that further enraged the demonstrators and eventually a Pan-Slavic Congress was held in Prague. A document was drafted at this congress and sent to the Hungarian government demanding the rights of the Slovak people.

However, the Austrian army was able to quell the rebellion. At the same time, at Schwechat, the Austrians defeated a Hungarian attempt to capture Vienna. After this victory, General [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz|Windischgr\u00e4tz]] and 70,000 troops were sent to Hungary to crush the Hungarian revolution. the Austrians followed the Danube down from Vienna and crossed over into Hungary to envelope Komorn (now [[Kom\u00e1rom]], Hungary and [[Kom\u00e1rno]], Slovakia). They continued down the Danube to Pest, the capital of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]]. After some fierce fighting, the Austrians, led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]], captured Buda and Pest.{{sfn|Marx|Engels||p=343}}  (the town was known in German as Ofen and later Buda and Pest were united into [[Budapest]]).\n\nIn April 1849, after these defeats, the Hungarian Government recovered and scored several victories on this western front. They stopped the Austrian advance and retook Buda and Pest. {{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=304}} Then, the Hungarian Army [[First Battle of Kom\u00e1rom (1849)|relieved the siege of Kom\u00e1rom]]. {{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=346}} The spring offensive hence proved to be a great success for the revolution.\n\nThus, the Hungarian Government was equally successful on its eastern front (Transylvania) against the Russians, and on its western front against the Austrians. But there was a third front&nbsp;\u2013 the southern front in the Banat, fighting the troops of the Serbian national movement and the Croatian troops of Jela\u010di\u0107 within the province of Vojvodina itself. [[M\u00f3r Perczel]], the General of the Hungarian forces in the Banat, was initially successful in battles along the southern front.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=331}}\n\nIn April 1849, [[Ludwig von Welden|Ludwig Baron von Welden]] replaced Windischgr\u00e4tz as the new supreme commander of Austrian forces in Hungary.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=19 April 1849|p=293}} Instead of pursuing the Austrian army, the Hungarians stopped to retake the Fort of Buda and prepared defenses. At the same time, however, victory in Italy had freed many Austrian troops which had hitherto been fighting on this front. In June 1849 Russian and Austrian troops entered Hungary heavily outnumbering the Hungarian army. After all appeals to other European states failed, Kossuth abdicated on August 11, 1849 in favour of [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], who he thought was the only general who was capable of saving the nation.\n\nHowever, in May 1849, Tsar Nicholas I pledged to redouble his efforts against the Hungarian Government. He and Emperor Franz Joseph started to regather and rearm an army to be commanded by [[Anton Vogl]], the Austrian lieutenant-field-marshal who had actively participated in the suppression of the national liberation movement in Galicia in 1848.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=618}} But even at this stage Vogl was occupied trying to stop another revolutionary uprising in Galicia.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=303}} The Tsar was also preparing to send 30,000 Russian soldiers back over the Eastern Carpathian Mountains from Poland. Austria held Galicia and moved into Hungary, independent of Vogl's forces.

Being one of the most determinative events in Hungary's modern history, it is also one of the cornerstones of the Hungarian national identity. The crucial turning point of the events were the [[April laws]] which were ratified by King [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], however the new young Austrian monarch [[Franz Joseph I]] arbitrarily revoked the laws without any legal competence. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Franz Joseph. The new constrained [[Stadion Constitution]] of Austria, the revocation of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny government]] (who searched agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s followers in the parliament, who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total [[independence]] from the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nAfter a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the Austrian Empire came close to the brink of collapse. The young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>Eric Roman: Austria-Hungary & the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present -PAGE: 67, Publisher: Infobase Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|9780816074693}}</ref> Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] answered, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces.

[[Ign\u00e1c Martinovics]] worked as a secret agent for the new Holy Roman Emperor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], until 1792. In his Oratio pro Leopoldo II, he explicitly declares that only authority derived from a [[social contract]] should be recognized; he saw the aristocracy as the enemy of mankind, because they prevented people from becoming educated. In another of his works, Catechism of People and Citizens, he argued that citizens tend to oppose any repression and that sovereignty resides with the people. He also became a Freemason, and was in favour of the adoption of a federal republic in Hungary. As a member of the Hungarian Jacobins, he was considered an idealistic forerunner of revolutionary thought by some, and an unscrupulous adventurer by others. He was in charge of stirring up a revolt against the nobility among the Hungarian serfs. For these subversive acts, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, dismissed Martinovics and his boss, Ferenc Gotthardi, the former chief of the secret police. He was executed, together with six other prominent Jacobins, in May 1795. More than 42 members of the republican secret society were arrested, including the poet [[J\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi]] and linguist [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]<ref>Charles W.

In the latter years of Francis I the dark shadow of Metternich's policy of \"stability\" fell across the kingdom, and the forces of reactionary absolutism were everywhere supreme. But beneath the surface a strong popular current was beginning to run in a contrary direction. Hungarian society, affected by western Liberalism, but without any direct help from abroad, was preparing for the future emancipation. Writers, savants, poets, artists, noble and plebeian, layman and cleric, without any previous concert, or obvious connection, were working towards that ideal of political liberty which was to unite all the Magyars. Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey, Ferencz Kazinczy and his associates, to mention but a few of many great names, were, consciously or unconsciously, as the representatives of the renascent national literature, accomplishing a political mission, and their pens proved no less efficacious than the swords of their ancestors.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1825 [[Emperor Francis II]] convened the Diet in response to growing concerns amongst the Hungarian nobility about taxes and the diminishing economy, after the Napoleonic wars. This \u2013 and the reaction to the reforms of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor#Ruling emperor<!-- see sub-chapter \"Reaction\" as well -->|Joseph II]] \u2013 started what is known as the Reform Period ({{lang-hu|reformkor}}).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} But the Nobles still retained their privileges of paying no taxes and not giving the vote to the masses.\n\nThe influential Hungarian politician Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] recognized the need to bring the country the advances of the more developed West European countries, such as England.\n\nIt was a direct attack upon the constitution which, to use the words of Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, first \"startled the nation out of its sickly drowsiness\". In 1823, when the reactionary powers were considering joint action to suppress the revolution in Spain, the government, without consulting the diet, imposed a war-tax and called out the recruits. The county assemblies instantly protested against this illegal act, and Francis I was obliged, at the diet of 1823, to repudiate the action of his ministers. But the estates felt that the maintenance of their liberties demanded more substantial guarantees than the dead letter of ancient laws. Sz\u00e9chenyi, who had resided abroad and studied Western institutions, was the recognized leader of all those who wished to create a new Hungary out of the old. For years he and his friends educated public opinion by issuing innumerable pamphlets in which the new Liberalism was eloquently expounded. In particular Sz\u00e9chenyi insisted that the people must not look exclusively to the government, or even to the diet, for the necessary reforms. Society itself must take the initiative by breaking down the barriers of class exclusiveness and reviving a healthy public spirit. The effect of this teaching was manifest at the diet of 1832, when the Liberals in the Lower Chamber had a large majority, prominent among whom were Ferenc De\u00e1k and \u00d6d\u00f6n Beothy. In the Upper House, however, the magnates united with the government to form a conservative party obstinately opposed to any project of reform, which frustrated all the efforts of the Liberals.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe new rising political star of the mid 1830s was [[Lajos Kossuth]], who started to rival with the popularity of Sz\u00e9chenyi due to his talent as orator in the liberal fraction of the parliament. Kossuth called for broader parliamentary democracy, rapid industrialization, general taxation, economic expansion through exports, and the abolition of serfdom and aristocratic privileges (equality before the law). The alarm of the government at the power and popularity of the Liberal party induced it, soon after the accession of the new king, the emperor Ferdinand I (1835\u20131848), to attempt to crush the reform movement by arresting and imprisoning the most active agitators among them, Lajos Kossuth and [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi]]. But the nation was no longer to be cowed. The diet of 1839 refused to proceed to business till the political prisoners had been released, and, while in the Lower Chamber the reforming majority was larger than ever, a Liberal party was now also formed in the Upper House under the leadership of Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny and Baron Joseph Eotvos. From 1000AD up to 1844, Latin language was the official language of administration, legislation and schooling in the Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Two progressive measures of the highest importance were passed by this diet, one making Magyar the official language of Hungary, the other freeing the peasants' holdings from all feudal obligations.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe results of the diet of 1839 did not satisfy the advanced Liberals, while the opposition of the government and of the Upper House still further embittered the general discontent. The chief exponent of this temper was the Pesti Hirlap, Hungary's first political newspaper, founded in 1841 by Kossuth, whose articles, advocating armed reprisals if necessary, inflamed the extremists but alienated Sz\u00e9chenyi, who openly attacked Kossuth's opinions. The polemic on both sides was violent; but, as usual, the extreme views prevailed, and on the assembling of the diet of 1843 Kossuth was more popular than ever, while the influence of Sz\u00e9chenyi had sensibly declined. The tone of this diet was passionate, and the government was fiercely attacked for interfering with the elections. A new party called as [[Opposition Party (Hungary)|Opposition party]] was created, which united the reform oriented Liberals, to oppose the conservatives. Fresh triumphs were won by the Liberals (the Opposition Party). Magyar was now declared to be the language of the schools and the law-courts as well as of the legislature; mixed marriages were legalized; and official positions were thrown open to non-nobles.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===\"Long debate\" of reformers in the press (1841\u20131848)===\nThe interval between the diet of 1843 and that of 1847 saw a complete disintegration and transformation of the various political parties. Sz\u00e9chenyi openly joined the government, while the moderate Liberals separated from the extremists and formed a new party, the Centralists. \n\n[[File:Pilvax Pest Preiszler.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The entrance room of the Pilvax coffee palace at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 1840s]]\n[[File:Pet\u0151fi Nemzeti M\u00fazeum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The recitation of the National Song at the National Museum]]\n[[File:A szabadsajt\u00f3 els\u0151 term\u00e9ke Pesten 1848. m\u00e1rcius 15.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The crowd captured the Landerer & Heckenast printing house, where they printed the 12 points and the National Song.

Sz\u00e9chenyi believed that economic, political and social reforms should proceed slowly and with care, in order to avoid the potentially disastrous prospect of violent interference from the Habsburg dynasty. Sz\u00e9chenyi was aware of the spread of Kossuth's ideas in Hungarian society, which he took to overlook the need for a good relationship with the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nKossuth, for his part, rejected the role of the aristocracy, and questioned established norms of social status. In contrast to Sz\u00e9chenyi, Kossuth believed that in the process of social reform it would be impossible to restrain civil society in a passive role. He warned against attempting to exclude wider social movements from political life, and supported democracy, rejecting the primacy of elites and the government. In 1885, he labeled Sz\u00e9chenyi a liberal elitist aristocrat, while Sz\u00e9chenyi considered Kossuth to be a democrat.<ref>Mih\u00e1ly Lack\u00f3: ''Sz\u00e9chenyi \u00e9s Kossuth vit\u00e1ja'', Gondolat, 1977.</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi was an isolationist politician, while Kossuth saw strong relations and collaboration with international liberal and progressive movements as essential for the success of liberty.<ref>See: Lacko p. 47</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi based his economic policy on the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' principles practiced by the [[British Empire]], while Kossuth supported protective tariffs due to the comparatively weak Hungarian industrial sector. While Kossuth envisioned the construction of a rapidly industrialized country, Sz\u00e9chenyi wanted to preserve the traditionally strong agricultural sector as the main characteristic of the economy.<ref>''Gr\u00f3f Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n \u00edr\u00f3i \u00e9s h\u00edrlapi vit\u00e1ja Kossuth Lajossal'' [Count Stephen Sz\u00e9chenyi,s Literary and Publicistic Debate with Louis Kossuth], ed.

This was also the last election which was based on the parliamentary system of the old feudal estates. All efforts to bring about an understanding between the government and the opposition were fruitless. Kossuth demanded not merely the redress of actual grievances, but a liberal reform which would make grievances impossible in the future. In the highest circles a dissolution of the diet now seemed to be the sole remedy; but, before it could be carried out, tidings of the February revolution in Paris reached Pressburg on the 1st of March, and on the 3rd of March Kossuth's motion for the appointment of an independent, responsible ministry was accepted by the Lower House. The moderates, alarmed not so much by the motion itself as by its tone, again tried to intervene; but on the 13th of March the Vienna revolution broke out, and the Emperor, yielding to pressure or panic, appointed Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny premier of the first Hungarian responsible ministry, which included Kossuth, Sz\u00e9chenyi and De\u00e1k.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hungary |volume=13 |pages=915\u2013918 |first1=Robert Nisbet |last1=Bain |first2=Walter Alison |last2=Phillips |inline=1}}</ref>\n\n==The bloodless revolution in Pest==\n{{further|12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848}}\n[[File:Magyar kok\u00e1rda.png|thumb|left|100px|The Hungarian [[cockade]] used in 1848]]\n\nThe crisis came from abroad - as Kossuth expected - and he used it to the full. On 3 March 1848, shortly after the news of the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in Paris]] had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, \"our beloved Archduke [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]]\" (then seventeen years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of [[Vienna]] to the mob by which [[Metternich]] was overthrown (13 March), and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. The arrival of the news of the revolution in Paris, and Kossuth's German speech about freedom and human rights had whipped up the passions of Austrian crowd in Vienna on March 13.<ref>Charles Frederick Henningsen: Kossuth and 'The Times', by the author of 'The revelations of Russia'. 1851 -PAGE: 10</ref>\nWhile Viennese masses celebrated Kossuth as their hero, revolution broke out in Buda on 15 March; Kossuth traveled home immediately.<ref>Peter F.

On the morning of March 15, 1848, revolutionaries marched around the city of Pest, reading [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]'s [[Nemzeti dal]] (National Song) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] (the twelve demands of theirs) to the crowd (which swelled to thousands). Declaring an end to all forms of censorship, they visited the printing presses of Landerer and Heckenast and printed Pet\u0151fi's poem together with the demands. A mass demonstration was held in front of the newly built National Museum, after which the group left for the Buda Chancellery (the Office of the Governor-General) on the other bank of the Danube.\n\nThe bloodless mass demonstrations in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Buda]] forced the Imperial governor to accept all twelve of their demands.\n\nAustria had its own problems with the [[Vienna Revolt|revolution in Vienna]] that year, and it initially acknowledged Hungary's government. Therefore, the Governor-General's officers, acting in the name of the King appointed Hungary's new parliament with [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny]] as its first Prime Minister. The Austrian monarchy also made other concessions{{Which|date=July 2011}} to subdue the Vienna masses: on 13 March 1848, Prince [[Klemens von Metternich]] was made to resign his position as the Austrian Government's Chancellor.

On 23 March 1848, as [[head of government]], Batthy\u00e1ny  commended his government to the Diet.\n\nThe first responsible government was formed:\n{|\n|-\n|Prime Minister: [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny]]\n|-\n|Minister of the Interior: [[Bertalan Szemere]]\n|-\n|Finance minister: [[Lajos Kossuth]]\n|-\n|Minister of Justice: [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|Minister of Defense: [[L\u00e1z\u00e1r M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros]]\n|-\n|Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and Trade: [[G\u00e1bor Klauz\u00e1l]]\n|-\n|Minister of Labour, Infrastructure, and Transport: [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]]\n|-\n|Minister of Education, Science, and Culture: [[J\u00f3zsef E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]]\n|-\n|Minister besides the King (roughly Foreign Minister): [[Paul III Anton, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|P\u00e1l Antal Esterh\u00e1zy]]\n|}\n\nWith the exception of Lajos Kossuth, all members of the government were the supporters of Sz\u00e9chenyi's ideas.\n\nThe Twelve Points, or the March Laws as they were now called, were then adopted by the legislature and received royal assent on 10 April. Hungary had, to all intents and purposes, become an independent state bound to Austria only by the Austrian Archduke as Palatine.<ref name=EB1911/> The new government approved a sweeping reform package, referred to as the \"[[April laws]]\", which created a democratic political system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dragon.unideb.hu/~kltegimn/CLASSES/12C/HTM/PZ/HU/APR21.HTM |title=''Az \u00e1prilisi t\u00f6rv\u00e9nyek'' (English: \"The April laws\") |language=Hungarian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=March 22, 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716180039/http://dragon.unideb.hu/~kltegimn/CLASSES/12C/HTM/PZ/HU/APR21.HTM |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref> The newly established government also demanded that the Habsburg Empire spend all taxes they received from Hungary in Hungary itself, and that the Parliament should have authority over the Hungarian regiments of the Habsburg Army.\n\nThe new suffrage law (Act V of 1848) transformed the old feudal estates based parliament ([[The Estates|Estates General]]) into a democratic representative parliament. This law offered the widest suffrage right in Europe at the time.<ref>prof. Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151 (2014): Nationalities and the Hungarian Parliament (1867-1918) LINK:[http://www.geroandras.hu/2014_Nationalities_and_the_Hungarian_Parliament.pdf]</ref>\nThe first general parliamentary elections were held in June, which were based on popular representation instead of feudal forms. The reform oriented political forces won the elections. The electoral system and franchise were similar to the contemporary British system.<ref>Steven A. Seidman and Peter Lang. ''Posters, Propaganda, and Persuasion in Election Campaigns Around the World''. p. 201</ref>\n\nAt that time the internal affairs and foreign policy of Hungary were not stable, and Batthy\u00e1ny faced many problems. His first and most important act was to organize the armed forces and the local governments. He insisted that the Austrian army, when in Hungary, would come under Hungarian law, and this was conceded by the Austrian Empire. He tried to repatriate conscript soldiers from Hungary. He established the [[Organisation of Militiamen]], whose job was to ensure internal security of the country.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny was a very capable leader, but he was stuck in the middle of a clash between the Austrian monarchy and the Hungarian separatists. He was devoted to the [[constitutional monarchy]] and aimed to keep the constitution, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with his work. \n\n[[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]] was [[Ban of Croatia|''Ban'' (Viceroy) of Croatia and Dalmatia]], regions included in the Kingdom of Hungary. He was opposed to the new Hungarian government, and raised troops in his domains.\n\nIn the summer of 1848, the Hungarian government, seeing the civil war ahead, tried to get the Habsburgs' support against Jela\u010di\u0107. They offered to send troops to northern Italy. In August 1848, the Imperial Government in Vienna officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest not to form an army.\n\nOn 29 August, with the assent of parliament, Batthy\u00e1ny  went with [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]] to the Emperor to ask him to order the Serbs to capitulate and stop Jela\u010di\u0107, who was going to attack Hungary. But Jela\u010di\u0107 went ahead and invaded Hungary to dissolve the Hungarian government, without any order from Austria.\n\nThough the Emperor formally relieved Jela\u010di\u0107 of his duties, Jela\u010di\u0107 and his army invaded [[Me\u0111imurje (region)|Murak\u00f6z (Me\u0111imurje)]] and the Southern [[Transdanubia]]n parts of Hungary on 11 September 1848.\n\nAfter the Austrian revolution in Vienna was defeated, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] replaced his uncle [[Ferdinand I of Austria]], who was not of sound mind. Franz Joseph didn't recognise Batthy\u00e1ny's second premiership, which began on 25 September. Also, Franz Joseph was not recognized as \"King of Hungary\" by the Hungarian parliament, and he was not crowned as \"King of Hungary\" until 1867. In the end, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field-Marshal [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] was given control of every army in Hungary (including Jela\u010di\u0107's). He went to Hungary where he was mobbed and viciously murdered. Following his murder the Imperial court dissolved the Hungarian Diet and appointed Jela\u010di\u0107 as Regent.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, Batthy\u00e1ny travelled again to Vienna to seek a compromise with the new Emperor. His efforts remained unsuccessful, because Franz Joseph refused to accept the reform laws. This was an unconstitutional deed, because the laws were already signed by his uncle, and the monarch had no right to revoke laws which were already signed.\n\nHungarian liberals in Pest saw this as an opportunity. In September 1848, the Diet made concessions to the Pest Uprising, so as not to break up the Austro-Hungarian Union. But the counter-revolutionary forces were gathering. After many{{Quantify|date=January 2014}} local victories, the combined Bohemian and Croatian armies entered Pest on 5 January 1849.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gazi |title=A History of Croatia |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |place=New York |year=1973 |page=150}}</ref>\n\nSo Batthy\u00e1ny and his government resigned, except for Kossuth, Szemere, and M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros. Later, on [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Palatine Stephen]]'s request, Batthy\u00e1ny became Prime Minister again. On 13 September Batthy\u00e1ny announced a rebellion and requested that the Palatine lead them. However the Palatine, under the Emperor's orders, resigned and left Hungary.\n\nHungary now had war raging on three fronts: Jela\u010di\u0107's [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian]] troops to the South, [[Hungarians in Romania|Romanians]] in [[Banat]] and in [[Transylvania]] to the East, and Austria to the west.\n\nThe Hungarian government was in serious military crisis due to the lack of soldiers, therefore they sent Kossuth (a brilliant orator) to recruit volunteers for the new Hungarian army. While Jela\u010di\u0107 was marching on Pest, Kossuth went from town to town rousing the people to the defense of the country, and the popular force of the Honv\u00e9d was his creation.\n\nWith the help of Kossuth's recruiting speeches, Batthy\u00e1ny quickly formed the [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]]. The new Hungarian army defeated the Croatians on 29 September at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]].\n\nThe battle became an icon for the Hungarian army for its effect on politics and morale. Kossuth's second letter for the Austrian people and this battle were the causes of the second revolution in Vienna on 6 October.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny slowly realized that he could not reach his main goal, peaceful compromise with the Habsburg dynasty. On 2 October he resigned and simultaneously resigned his seat in parliament.  The ministers of his cabinet also resigned on the same day.\n\n===The Austrian Stadion Constitution and the renewal of antagonism===\nThe Habsburg government in Vienna proclaimed a new constitution, the so-called [[Stadion Constitution]] on 4 March 1849.<ref>{{cite book | title= Diglossia and Power: Language Policies and Practice in the 19th Century Habsburg Empire | last= Schjerve | first= Rosita Rindler | year= 2003 | pages= 75\u201376 | series= Language, Power, and Social Process | volume= 9 | publisher= Walter de Gruyter | location= Berlin | isbn= 9783110176544 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JOTFCTYSjicC&pg=PA75 | ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= Francis Joseph I.: His Life and Times | last= Mahaffy | first= Robert Pentland | year= 1908 | page= [https://archive.org/details/francisjosephih00mahagoog/page/n55 39] | publisher= Duckworth | location= Covent Garden | url= https://archive.org/details/francisjosephih00mahagoog | ref= harv}}</ref> The centralist Stadion Constitution provided very strong power for the monarch, and marked the way of neo-absolutism.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walther Killy |title=Dictionary of German biography |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |volume=9: Schmidt-Theyer |year=2005 |page=237 |isbn=9783110966299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-hrRQvGV7sC&pg=PA237}}</ref> The new March Constitution of Austria was drafted by the [[Imperial Diet (Austria)|Imperial Diet of Austria]], where Hungary had no representation.

The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur G\u00f6rgey in particular, whose abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of G\u00f6rgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others.\n\nDuring all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat at the Battle of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent J\u00f3zef Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr [[William Henry Stiles]] (1808\u20131865), the American envoy. Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and the Hungarian government \u2013 set up lawfully on the basis of the April laws. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, Kossuth issued the celebrated Hungarian Declaration of Independence, in which he declared that \"the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.\" It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. The dethronement also made any compromise with the Habsburgs practically impossible.\n\nKossuth played a key role in tying down the Hungarian army for weeks for the siege and recapture of Buda castle, finally successful on 21 May 1849. The hopes of ultimate success were, however, frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and on 11 August Kossuth abdicated in favor of G\u00f6rgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the general alone could save the nation. G\u00f6rgey capitulated at Vil\u00e1gos (now \u015eiria, Romania) to the Russians, who handed over the army to the Austrians.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==War of Independence==\n[[File:Buda ostroma 1849. m\u00e1jus 21.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Siege of Buda (1849)|Siege of Buda]] in May 1849]]\nIn 1848 and 1849, the [[Hungarian people]] or Magyars, who wanted independence, formed a majority only in the central areas of the country.

In 1804 the semi-independent [[Principality of Serbia]] had formed south of the Danube with Belgrade as its capital. So in 1849, the Danube divided Serbia from the Kingdom of Hungary. The Hungarian district on the northern side of the river was called \"[[Vojvodina]]\", and by that time it was home to almost half a million Serbian inhabitants. According to the [[Demographic history of Vojvodina#1840|census of 1840 in Vojvodina]] Serbs comprised 49% of the total population. The Serbs of Vojvodina had sought their independence or attachment with the [[Principality of Serbia]] on the other side of the Danube. In face of the emerging Hungarian independence movement leading up to the 1848 Revolution the Austrian monarchy had promised an independent status for the Serbs of Vojvodina within the Austrian Empire.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nToward this end, [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] was appointed Patriarch of Vojvodina in February 1849.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=613}}  Raja\u010di\u0107 was a supporter of the Serbian national movement, although somewhat conservative with pro-Austrian leanings. At a crucial point during the war against the Hungarian Government, in late March 1849 when the Austrians needed more Serbian soldiers to fight the war, the Austrian General [[Georg Rukavina Baron von Vidovgrad]], who commanded the Austrian troops in Hungary, officially re-stated this promise of independence for Vojvodina and conceded to all the demands of the Patriarch regarding Serbian nationhood.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=250|loc=The War in Hungary}}  Acquiescence to the demands of the Patriarch should have meant a relaxation of the strict military administration of Vojvodina. Under this military administration in the border areas, any male between the ages of 16 years and 60 years of age could be conscripted into the army.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}\n\nThe Serbs of Vojvodina were expecting their requirement for Austrian military conscription to be the first measure to be relaxed. But the new Emperor Franz Joseph had other ideas and this promise was broken not more than two weeks after it had been made to the people of Vojvodina. This caused a split in the population of the Vojvodina and at least part of the Serbs in that province began to support the elected Hungarian Government against the Austrians{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}.

However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to [[Magyarization|Magyarize]] the Slovak region under Hungarian control. The aim of this was to bring the varied ethnic groups around Hungary into a common culture. At the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution this process was seen as more imminent and threatening to ethnic groups, especially the Slovaks.<ref name=slovak>\u0160piesz, Anton (2006), Illustrated Slovak History, Wauconda, Illinois: Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, {{ISBN|0-86516-500-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Slovaks made demands that their culture be spared Magyarization and that they be given certain liberties and rights. These demands soon broke out into demonstrations clamouring for the rights of ethnic minorities in Hungary. Arrests were made that further enraged the demonstrators and eventually a Pan-Slavic Congress was held in Prague. A document was drafted at this congress and sent to the Hungarian government demanding the rights of the Slovak people. The Hungarians responded by imposing martial law on the Slovak region.<ref name=slovak/>\n\nThe Imperial government recognized that all across the Empire, ethnic minorities were seeking more autonomy, but it was only Hungary that desired a complete break. They used this by supporting the ethnic national movements against the Hungarian government. Slovak volunteer units were commissioned in Vienna to join campaigns against the Hungarians across the theatre. A Slovak regiment then marched to Myjava{{Clarify|reason = spelling mistake?|date=January 2016}} where a Slovak council openly seceded from Hungary. Tensions rose as the Hungarian army executed a number of Slovak leaders for treason and the fighting became more bloody.<ref name=slovak/>\n\nHowever, the Western Slovak uprising also wanted its autonomy from Hungary. Slovak leaders hoped, that [[Upper Hungary]] would became part of Austrian part of the empire. Tensions with the Austrians soon began to rise. Lacking support and with increased Hungarian efforts, the Slovak volunteer corps had little impact for the rest of the war until the Russians marched in. It was used in 'mopping up' resistance in the wake of the Russian advance and then soon after was disbanded, ending Slovak involvement in the Revolution.

of China''', sometimes known as the '''All China Games''' (though not to be confused with the [[All-China Games]]), is the premier sports event in [[China]] at national level. It is usually held once every four years, most recently in August 2017, when the [[2017 National Games of China|13th National Games of China]] took place in [[Tianjin]]. \n\nThe forerunner of the Games was the '''Chinese National Games''', first held in 1910 during the [[Qing dynasty]]. This tournament ran until 1948 and the competition was relaunched under its current name in 1959, following the [[history of the People's Republic of China|formation of the People's Republic of China]].<ref>[http://www.gbrathletics.com/nc/chn.htm Chinese National Games].
