One night, he discovers his father's hidden stash of homemade porn featuring gay men and trans women. He becomes a successful high school quarterback, but his adolescence is marked by anger issues, a discomfort around naked men, and an aggressive attitude towards Maddy. In the present day, Nate breaks into Tyler's house and violently assaults him, accusing him of raping Maddy, who falsely claimed she blacked out during the night of the party. On the first day of school, Rue breaks down in tears and runs out of gym class after being asked to talk about her summer, during which her overdose took place. Lexi attempts to comfort her, but is rejected. Rue reminisces about trying [[oxycodone]] for the first time at the age of 13, while her father was dying of cancer. Kat finds out that a sex tape from the party was filmed and uploaded online, but denies it is her. After finding more copies of the video online, Kat realizes that she can make money off of men's attraction to her. Jules starts talking with an anonymous closeted jock online.

Frankfurt is the largest city in the [[Rhine Franconian]] dialect area ([[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialects), Frankfurt was one of the host cities of the official tournaments of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nFrankfurt was a [[city state]], the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], as a site of [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|imperial coronations]]; it lost its [[sovereignty]] upon the collapse of the empire in 1806 and then permanently in 1866, when it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. It has been part of the federal state of [[Hesse]] since 1945. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse, with half of its population, and a majority of young people, [[Immigration to Germany|having a migration background]]. A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many [[expatriate]]s.\n\nFrankfurt is an [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network#Alpha 2|alpha world city]] and a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and transportation. It is the site of many global and European corporate headquarters. [[Frankfurt Airport]] is among the world's busiest. Frankfurt is the major [[financial centre]] of the European continent, with the headquarters of the [[European Central Bank]], [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW]], [[Commerzbank]], several [[Cloud computing|cloud]] and [[Financial technology|fintech]] [[Startup company|startups]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Startup Ecosystem Survey \u2013 Startup Genome.

It is one of the few cities in the European Union to have such a skyline and because of it Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as [[Mainhattan]], a [[portmanteau]] of the local [[Main (river)|Main River]] and [[Manhattan]]. The other well known and obvious nickname is [[Bankfurt]]. Before [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|World War II]] the city was globally noted for its unique [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|old town]] with timber-framed buildings, the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The [[R\u00f6mer]] area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as [[Christmas market]]s. Other parts of the old town are to be reconstructed as part of the [[Dom-R\u00f6mer Project]] by 2016.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Die Frankenfurt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The legend of the ''Frankenfurt'' (ford of the Franks)]]\n''Frankonovurd'' (in [[Old High German]]) or ''Vadum Francorum'' (in [[Latin]]) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to ''Frankenfort'' during the [[Middle Ages]] and then to ''Franckfort'' and ''Franckfurth'' in the [[modern history|modern era]]. According to historian [[David Gans]], the city was named {{c.}} 146 AD by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as [[Sicambri]]. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage.<ref>Dovid Solomon Ganz, ''Tzemach David'' (part 2), Warsaw 1859, p. 13b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: ''Cemahc Dawid''; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, ''Fredegar and the History of France'', University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536\u2013538.</ref> The name is derived from the ''Franconofurd'' of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Franks]]; ''Furt'' ([[cf.]] English ''[[ford (river)|ford]]'') where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.\n\nBy the 19th century, the name ''Frankfurt'' had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of ''Frankfort'' is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling (e.g., [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]; [[Frankfort (town), New York|Frankfort, New York]]; [[Frankfort, Illinois]]).\n\nThe suffix ''am Main'' has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of ''Frankfurt am Main'' means \"Frankfurt on the Main\" (pronounced like English ''mine'' or German ''mein''). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: ''{{Lang|de|Furt}}'') on the [[Main (river)|Main River]]. As a part of early [[Franconia]], the inhabitants were the early [[Franks]], thus the city's name reveals its legacy as \"the ford of the Franks on the Main\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&lpg=PA135&pg=PA135|title=Placenames of the world|last=Room|first=Adrian|publisher=McFarland|year=2006|page=135|accessdate=23 July 2009 | isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7}}</ref>\n\nAmong English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the [[States of Germany|''Land'']] of [[Brandenburg]] on the Polish border.\n\nThe city district [[Bonames]] has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from ''bona me(n)sa'' (good table).\n\nThe common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are ''Frankfurt (Main)'', ''Frankfurt (M)'', ''Frankfurt a. M.'', ''Frankfurt/Main'' or ''Frankfurt/M''. The common [[abbreviation]] for the name of the city is \"FFM\". Also in use is \"FRA\", the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for Frankfurt Airport.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Frankfurt am Main|Timeline of Frankfurt}}\n\n===Early history and Holy Roman Empire===\n[[Germania|Roman settlements]] were established in the area of the ''R\u00f6mer'', probably in the first century. ''Nida'' ([[Heddernheim]]) was also a Roman civitas capital.\n\n[[Alemanni]] and Franks [[Francia|lived there]], and by 794, [[Charlemagne]] presided over an [[Council of Frankfurt|imperial assembly]] and church synod, at which ''Franconofurd'' (alternative spellings end with -furt and -vurd) was first mentioned.\n\nFrankfurt was one of the most important cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 855, the [[List of German Kings and Emperors|German kings and emperors]] were elected and crowned in [[Aachen]]. From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned in Frankfurt, initiated for [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. This tradition ended in 1792, when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on [[Bastille Day]], 14 July, the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]]. The elections and coronations took place in [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholom\u00e4us Cathedral]], known as the ''Kaiserdom'' (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.\n\nThe ''[[Messe Frankfurt|Frankfurter Messe]]'' (Frankfurt Trade Fair) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Friedrich II]] granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs began in 1478.\n\nIn 1372, Frankfurt became a ''Reichsstadt'' ([[Imperial Free City]]), i.e., directly subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.\n\nIn 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of [[exchange rate]]s for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nFrankfurt managed to remain neutral during the [[Thirty Years' War]], but suffered from the [[bubonic plague]] that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theatre principal [[Abel Seyler]] was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mohr |first=Albert Richard |authorlink=Albert Richard Mohr|year=1967 |chapter=Abel Seyler und seine Verdienste um das Frankfurter Theaterleben|title= Frankfurter Theater von der Wandertruppe zum Kom\u00f6dienhaus: ein Beitrag zur Theatergeschichte des 18.

It remained a [[Free imperial city|free city]] until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the [[principality of Aschaffenburg]] under the ''F\u00fcrstprimas'' ([[Prince-Primate]]), [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]]. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the [[confederation of the Rhine]]. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] intended to make his adopted son [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], already ''Prince de Venise'' (\"[[prince of Venice]]\", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813, when the military tide turned in favour of the Anglo-Prussian lead allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favour of Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.\n\n===Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state===\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded [[German Confederation]] (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its ''Bundestag'', the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Emperor of Austria]] was represented by an Austrian \"presidential envoy\".\n\nAfter the ill-fated [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the [[Frankfurter Paulskirche]] (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. The institution failed in 1849 when the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]], declared that he would not accept \"a crown from the gutter\". In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch.\n\n===Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty===\n[[File:Courbet Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|''View of Frankfurt am Main'', including the [[Alte Br\u00fccke (Frankfurt)|Alte Br\u00fccke]] (Old Bridge), by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1858)]]\nFrankfurt lost its independence after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the [[Free City of Frankfurt]]. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of [[Hesse-Nassau]]. The Prussian occupation and annexation was perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of [[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] and [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] were incorporated in 1890.\n\nIn 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.\n\nFrom 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the [[Ruhr uprising]], [[French occupation of Frankfurt|Frankfurt was occupied by French troops]].<ref>[http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html Chronology: Emergence of a Modern City 1866\u20131945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085810/http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html |date=19 July 2011 }}.

During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]], the synagogues of the city were destroyed.\n\nFrankfurt was severely [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|bombed in World War II]] (1939\u20131945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|medieval city centre]], by that time the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a [[Battle of Frankfurt|ground battlefield]] on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] and the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]] of the [[United States Army]] captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946 |last=Stanton |first=Shelby |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811701570 |pages=57, 84}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-(Darmstadt)]] and the [[Province of Kurhessen|Prussian Hesse]] provinces. The city was part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of Occupation]] of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945\u20131949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949\u20131952) had their headquarters in the [[IG Farben Building]], intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.\n\nFrankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of [[West Germany]] in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of [[Hessischer Rundfunk]]). In the end, [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first postwar [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]], preferred the town of [[Bonn]], for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a [[German reunification|reunification]] with [[East Germany]] and the eventual return of the capital to [[Berlin]].\n\nPostwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., [[R\u00f6mer]], [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|St. Paul's Church]], and [[Goethe House]]). The collection of historically significant [[Cairo Genizah]] documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to [[Arabist]] and Genizah scholar [[S.D. Goitein]], \"not even handlists indicating its contents have survived.\"<ref>Goitein, S.D.

In 1948, the allies founded the [[Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder]], the forerunner of [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Dresdner Bank]]. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.\n\nFrankfurt also re-emerged as Germany's transportation centre and [[Frankfurt Airport]] became Europe's second-busiest airport behind [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1961.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Port of Frankfurt|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php|website=World Port Source|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> That system includes a suburban rail system ([[Frankfurt S-Bahn|S-Bahn]]) linking outlying communities with the city centre, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches ([[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.\n\nIn 1998, the [[European Central Bank]] was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]] in 2011.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:On_top_of_the_Main_Tower.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Top of [[Main Tower]] looking East]]\nIt is the largest city in the [[federated state]] of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany.\n\n===Site===\n[[File:Frankfurt Skyline with Cranes.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Frankfurt's skyline from across the Main, showing construction cranes]]\nFrankfurt is located on both sides of the [[Main (river)|Main River]], south-east of the [[Taunus]] mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the [[Frankfurt City Forest]], Germany's largest city forest. The city area is {{convert|248.31|km\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} and extends over {{convert|23.4|km|2|abbr=on}} east to west and {{convert|23.3|km|2|abbr=on}} north to south. The city centre is north of the River Main in [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district (the historical centre) and the surrounding [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district. The geographical centre is in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district near [[Frankfurt West station]].\n\nFrankfurt is the centre of the densely populated [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region]] with a population of 5.5&nbsp;million. Other important cities in the region are [[Wiesbaden]] (capital of [[Hesse]]), [[Mainz]] (capital of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Hanau]], [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]], [[Wetzlar]] and [[Marburg]].\n\n===Districts===\n[[File:Frankfurt Subdivisions boroughs.svg|thumb|The 46 ''Stadtteile'' (city districts) of central Frankfurt]]\n\nThe city is divided into 46 city districts (''Stadtteile''), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (''Stadtbezirke'') and 448 electoral districts (''Wahlbezirke''). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (''[[Ortsbezirk (Frankfurt am Main)|Ortsbezirke]]''), which each have a district committee and chairperson.\n\nThe largest city district by population and area is [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]], while the smallest is [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] and [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]]) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (''-Nord'') and a southern (''-S\u00fcd'') part, respectively a western (''-West'') and an eastern (''-Ost'') part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the City's official website).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2835 |title=Stadtteile |publisher=Frankfurt.de |date= |access-date=27 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014170007/http://frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2835 |archive-date=14 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSome larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]] and [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]]), Goldstein (part of [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]]), Riedberg (part of [[Kalbach-Riedberg (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach-Riedberg]]) and [[Europaviertel (Frankfurt)|Europaviertel]] (part of [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]]). The [[Bankenviertel]] (''banking district''), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district, the southern [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] district and the eastern [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district).\n\nMany city districts are incorporated suburbs (''[[Vororte]]''), or were previously independent cities, such as [[H\u00f6chst (Frankfurt am Main)|H\u00f6chst]]. Some like [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] and [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] arose during the rapid growth of the city in the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] following the [[Unification of Germany]], while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city district(s), such as [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] and [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]].\n\n===History of incorporations===\nUntil the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]], [[Gutleutviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Gutleutviertel]], [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]], [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]], [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]], [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] and [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].\n\n[[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] was part of an administrative district called ''Landkreis Frankfurt'', before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] on 1 April 1895. [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]], [[Niederrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederrad]] and [[Oberrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Oberrad]] followed on 1 July 1900. The ''Landkreis Frankfurt'' was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore [[Berkersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Berkersheim]], [[Bonames (Frankfurt am Main)|Bonames]], [[Eckenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eckenheim]], [[Eschersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eschersheim]], [[Ginnheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], [[Hausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Hausen]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]], [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]], [[Preungesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Preungesheim]] and [[R\u00f6delheim (Frankfurt am Main)|R\u00f6delheim]] joined the City. In the same year a new city district, [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]], was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.\n\nOn 1 April 1928 the City of [[H\u00f6chst (Frankfurt am Main)|H\u00f6chst]] became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts [[Sindlingen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sindlingen]], [[Unterliederbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Unterliederbach]] and [[Zeilsheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Zeilsheim]]. Simultaneously the ''Landkreis H\u00f6chst'' was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt ([[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]], [[Griesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Griesheim]], [[Nied (Frankfurt am Main)|Nied]], [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]], [[Sossenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Sossenheim]]) or joining the newly established ''Landkreis'' of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]].\n\n[[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.\n\n[[File:Enkheimer Ried.jpg|thumb|[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Enkheimer]] Ried]]\nOn 1 August 1972 Hesse's smaller suburbs of [[Harheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Harheim]], [[Kalbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach]], [[Nieder-Erlenbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Erlenbach]], and [[Nieder-Eschbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Eschbach]] became districts while other neighbouring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the [[Landkreis Offenbach]], the [[Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau]], the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] or the [[Wetteraukreis]].\n\n[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bergen-Enkheim]] was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.\n\n[[Flughafen (Frankfurt am Main)|Flughafen]] became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighbouring city of [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]].\n\nFrankfurt's youngest city district is [[Frankfurter Berg]]. It was part of Bonames until 1996.\n\nKalbach was officially renamed [[Kalbach-Riedberg]] in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.\n\n===Neighbouring districts and cities===\n[[File:Locator map of Planungsverband Ballungsraum Frankfurt Rhein-Main in Hesse.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Frankfurt urban area within [[Hesse]]]]\n\nTo the west Frankfurt borders the [[Districts of Germany|administrative district]] (''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]] with towns such as [[Hattersheim am Main]], [[Kriftel]], [[Hofheim am Taunus]], [[Kelkheim (Taunus)|Kelkheim]], [[Liederbach am Taunus]], [[Sulzbach (Taunus)|Sulzbach]], [[Schwalbach am Taunus]] and [[Eschborn]]; to the northwest the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]], [[Oberursel (Taunus)]] and [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]]; to the north the [[Wetteraukreis]] with [[Karben]] and [[Bad Vilbel]]; to the northeast the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] with [[Niederdorfelden]] and [[Maintal]]; to the southeast the city of [[Offenbach am Main]]; to the south the [[Offenbach (district)|Kreis Offenbach]] with [[Neu-Isenburg]] and to the southwest the [[Gro\u00df-Gerau (district)|Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau]] with [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]] and [[Kelsterbach]].\n\nTogether with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., [[Hanau]], [[Rodgau]], [[Dreieich]], [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called ''Stadtregion Frankfurt'' which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3&nbsp;million in 2010 and is therefore the [[Largest urban areas in the European Union|13th largest urban area in the European Union]].\n\n===Climate===\nFrankfurt has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]-[[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''). Its average annual temperature is {{convert|10.6|\u00b0C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|1.6|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|20.0|\u00b0C|1}} in July.\n\n{{Weather

With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before [[World War II]]. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 825,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2020 and more than 2.5&nbsp;million inhabitants in its urban area.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the state government of [[Hesse]] wanted to include the entire urban area into its administrative boundaries. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.<ref>H.

The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbours. The ''Kaisersaal'' (\"Emperor's Hall\") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The R\u00f6mer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the R\u00f6merberg, is named after the city hall.\n\nThe former [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) quarter between the R\u00f6mer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was to be redeveloped as the [[Dom-R\u00f6mer Project|Dom-R\u00f6mer Quarter]] through 2016, including [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructions]] of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.\n\n'''Frankfurt Cathedral'''\n\n[[Frankfurt Cathedral]] (Frankfurter Dom) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]]. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the [[Merovingian]] time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman-German]] emperors were crowned there.\n\nSince the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called ''Dom'', although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 meters. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 meters, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Frankfurt Am Main-St Bartholomaeus-Ansicht vom Nextower-20110812.jpg\n| width1 = 300\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = <center>[[Frankfurt Cathedral]]</center>\n| image2 = Frankfurt Am Main-Samstagsberg von Suedwesten-20110705.jpg\n| width2 = 300\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = <center>[[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]]</center>\n| image3 = Frankfurt Paulskirche au\u00dfen 2011a.jpg\n| width3 = 200\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = <center>[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]]</center>\n| footer = \n}}\n\n'''St. Paul's Church'''\n\n[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]] (''Paulskirche'') is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a [[Protestant]] church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of [[Prussia]] and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849 Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved. Afterwards, the building was used for church services again.\n\nSt. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II, particularly its interior, which now has a modern appearance. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.\n\n[[File:Frankfurt Hauptwache View.jpg|thumb|right|The view towards downtown Frankfurt from [[Zeil]] shopping street]]\n\n'''Arch\u00e4ologischer Garten Frankfurt'''\n\nThe Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (''Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt'') from the 6th century. The garden is located between the R\u00f6merberg and the Cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. There are plans underway to construct a building on top of the garden but anyhow it is decided that the garden will stay open to the public.\n\n'''Haus Wertheim'''\n\nWertheim House is the only [[Timber framing|timbered house]] in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the R\u00f6merberg next to the Historical Museum.\n\n'''Saalhof'''\n\nThe [[Saalhof]] is the oldest conserved building in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch [[cloth merchant|clothiers]] when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th century. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the [[Historical museum, Frankfurt|Historical Museum]].\n\n'''Eiserner Steg'''\n\nThe Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects R\u00f6merberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the [[Wehrmacht]], it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.\n\n[[File:Alte Oper Frankfurt Winter 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Alte Oper]], now a concert hall, at Opernplatz]]\n\n'''Alte Oper'''\n\nThe [[Alte Oper]] is a former [[opera house]], hence the name \"Old Opera\". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed \"Germany's most beautiful ruin\". Former Frankfurt [[Lord Mayor]] Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname \"Dynamite-Rudi\". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)\n\nPublic pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the \"new\" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the [[frieze]] of the Alte Oper says: \"''Dem Wahren, Sch\u00f6nen, Guten''\" (\"To the true, the beautiful, the good\").\n\n'''Eschenheimer Turm'''\n\nThe Eschenheim Tower (''[[Eschenheimer Turm]]'') was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district.\n\n'''[[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]'''\n\nSt. Catherine's Church (''Katharinenkirche'') is the largest [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant]] church, dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]], a [[martyr]]ed early Christian saint. It is located in the city centre at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.\n\n'''Hauptwache'''\n\nAlthough today [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|of the same name]], the name originates from a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as \"main guard-house\". Today the square surrounding the building is also called \"Hauptwache\" (formal: ''An der Hauptwache''). It is situated in the city centre opposite to St. Catherine's Church and houses a famous caf\u00e9.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Frankfurt Main Hauptwache Katharinenkirche 20120707.jpg\n| width1 = 300\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = <center>[[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] and [[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]</center>\n| image2 = Frankfurt Nextower.20130514.jpg\n| width2 = 130\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = <center>[[Eschenheimer Turm]]</center>\n| image3 = Frankfurt Main Hauptbahnhof 6229.jpg\n| width3 = 300\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = <center>[[Frankfurt Central Station]]</center>\n| footer = \n}}\n\n'''Central Station'''\n\n[[Frankfurt Central Station]] (''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof''), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller train stations in the city centre and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a [[Terminal station|terminus station]] and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof|Leipzig Central Station]] was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neorenaissance]]-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]]-style.\n\n'''Frankfurter Hof'''\n\nThe Frankfurter Hof is a landmarked hotel in the city centre at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876. It is part of [[Steigenberger Hotels]] group and is considered the city's most prestigious.\n\n'''St. Leonhard'''\n\n[[St. Leonhard, Frankfurt|St. Leonhard]], on the Main close to the bridge Eiserner Steg, is a Catholic [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] [[hall church]], derived from a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] [[basilica]] beginning in 1425. It is the only one of nine churches in the Old Town that survived World War II almost undamaged. The parish serves the English-speaking community. The church has been under restoration since 2011.\n\n===20th-century architecture===\n* '''[[Frauenfriedenskirche]]''' and '''[[Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim|Holy Cross Church]]''' (with the [[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg]]), both consecrated 1929, are examples of early modernist church buildings during the time of the [[New Frankfurt]].\n* '''[[Gro\u00dfmarkthalle|Grossmarkthalle]]''', built 1926\u20131928 as a part of the [[New Frankfurt]]-project, the former wholesale market hall, was (following reconstruction) to become part of the future [[seat of the European Central Bank]].\n* '''[[Goethe House]]''', rebuilt 1947.

Farbenindustrie AG]]. It is located in the [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] district and borders [[Gr\u00fcneburgpark]] in the west. Upon its completion, the complex was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest office building]] in Europe and remained so until the 1950s.

It became the principal location for implementing the [[Marshall Plan]], which largely financed the post-war reconstruction of Europe. The state apparatus of the [[West Germany|Federal German Government]] was devised there. It served as the headquarters for the [[U.S. V Corps|US Army's V Corps]] and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995 when the US Army returned control of the IG Farben Building to the German government. It was purchased on behalf of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] by the state of [[Hesse]].

The first building to exceed the 95-metre-high cathedral was not an office building but a [[grain silo]], the {{convert|120|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Henninger Turm]], built from 1959 to 1961.\n\nThe first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when [[Westend Gate]] (then called ''Plaza B\u00fcro Center'') and [[Silberturm]] were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 metres and 166.3 metres, respectively. Around the same time, [[Frankfurter B\u00fcro Center]] and [[City-Haus]] (142.4 metres and 142.1 metres) were constructed at Mainzer Landstra\u00dfe and [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] (148.0 metres) and [[Garden Tower]] (127.0 metres; then called ''Helaba-Hochhaus'') were constructed in the financial district.\n\nNone of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the [[Deutsche Bank Twin Towers]] at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 metres tall.\n\nThe 1990s featured a second wave. [[Messeturm]], built on the trade fair site, reached a height of 256.5 metres and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the {{convert|259|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Commerzbank Tower]] in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are [[Westendstrasse 1]] (208.0 metres), [[Main Tower]] (200.0 metres) and [[Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)|Trianon]] (186.0 metres).\n\nIn 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., [[Skyper]], [[Opernturm]], [[Tower 185]], [[Seat of the European Central Bank]], [[Taunusturm]]) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.\n\n===Other tall structures===\n[[File:Europaturm Abend.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the [[Europaturm]], a 337&nbsp;m communications tower]]\n* '''[[Europaturm]] \u2014''' The Europe Tower is a [[Radio masts and towers|telecommunications tower]], also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 metres it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]]. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the \"Ginnheimer Spargel\" (''Ginnheim Asparagus''), but stands a few metres within [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district.\n* '''[[Henninger Turm]] \u2014''' The Henninger Tower was a 120-metre-high [[grain silo]] built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by [[Henninger Brewery]]. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 metres and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 metres. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140&nbsp;m (459&nbsp;ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm, and will contain 130 luxury apartments. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and was expected to be completed sometime in 2016. From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly [[Road bicycle racing|cycling race]] was named after the tower, the \"Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm\" (''Cycling race around Henninger Tower'').

It is traditionally served in a glass, typically decorated with lozenges, called \"Geripptes\", a full glass is then called \"Schoppen\". Apfelwein is also available in a stoneware jar locally known as \"Bembel\". A group normally orders a \"Bembel\" and shares the contents. Apfelwein can be ordered as \"sauergespritzer\", which is apfelwein blended with 30% mineral water or as \"s\u00fcssgespritzer\", which is Apfelwein blended with lemon soda, orange soda or fresh-pressed apple juice (lemon soda being the most common). Most of the pubs which serve Apfelwein are located in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]], which is therefore known as \"Ebbelwoi district\".

Run by transport company [[Fraport]] it ranks among the [[world's busiest airports by passenger traffic]] and is the [[world's busiest airports by cargo traffic|busiest airport by cargo traffic]] in Europe. The airport also serves as a hub for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] and as the main hub for German [[flag carrier]] [[Lufthansa]]. Depending upon whether total passengers or flights are used for calculations, it ranks third or second busiest in Europe alongside [[London Heathrow Airport]] and [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport]]. Passenger traffic at Frankfurt Airport in 2012 was 57.5&nbsp;million. \n\nA third terminal is being constructed (plan to open in 2023).

The [[Frankfurter Kreuz]] is an Autobahn interchange close to the airport, where the [[Bundesautobahn 3]] (A3), [[Cologne]] to [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and the [[Bundesautobahn 5]] (A5), [[Basel]] to [[Hanover]], meet. With approximately 320,000 cars passing through it every day it is Europe's most heavily used interchange. The [[Bundesautobahn 66]] (A66) connects Frankfurt with [[Wiesbaden]] in the west and [[Fulda]] in the east. The [[Bundesautobahn 661]] (A661) is mainly a commuter motorway which starts in the south (Egelsbach), runs through the eastern part and ends in the north ([[Oberursel]]). The [[Bundesautobahn 648]] (A648) is a very short motorway in the western part which primarily serves as a fast connection between the A 66 and the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]]. The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the north-east form a [[ring road]] around the inner city districts and define a [[Low-emission zone]] (''Umweltzone''; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria to enter the zone.\n\nThe streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during [[rush hour]]. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestra\u00dfe and Fre\u00dfgass, are pedestrian-only streets.

The long-distance station is located outside the actual airport ground but has a connecting bridge for pedestrians to Terminal 1, concourse B. [[Frankfurt Airport regional station]] (''Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof'') is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S8, S9) and regional trains. The regional station is located within Terminal 1, concourse B.\n\n====Frankfurt South station====\nFrankfurt's third long-distance station is [[Frankfurt South station]] (''Frankfurt S\u00fcdbahnhof'', often abbreviated as ''Frankfurt (Main) S\u00fcd'' or ''F-S\u00fcd''), located in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It is an important destination for local trains and trams (lines 14 to 16, 19) and the terminal stop for four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U8) and four S-Bahn lines (S3, S4, S5, S6).\n\n====Messe stations====\nThe [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] offers two railway stations: [[Frankfurt Messe station|Messe station]] is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S3-S6) and is located at the centre of the trade fair premises while Festhalle/Messe station is served by U-Bahn line U4 and is located at the north-east corner of the premises.\n\n====Konstablerwache station and Hauptwache station====\nTwo other major railway stations in the city centre are Konstablerwache and Hauptwache, located on each end of the Zeil.

Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt city tunnel and serve the stations [[Frankfurt Ostendstra\u00dfe station|Ostendstra\u00dfe]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Konstablerwache station|Konstablerwache]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache]], [[Taunusanlage station|Taunusanlage]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station]]. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[Darmstadt]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]], [[Hanau]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Oberursel]], [[Bad Homburg]], [[Kronberg]], [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] and smaller towns that are on the way.\nThe S8/S9 runs 24/7.\n\n====U-Bahn====\n{{main|Frankfurt U-Bahn}}\nThe [[U-Bahn]] has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact [[light rail]] (''[[Stadtbahn]]'') as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5 to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3 and 5-minute intervals on city centre tracks shared by more than one line.\n\n====Tram====\n{{main|Trams in Frankfurt am Main}}\nFrankfurt has ten [[tram]] lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes.

It is one of the few cities in the European Union to have such a skyline and because of it Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as [[Mainhattan]], a [[portmanteau]] of the local [[Main (river)|Main River]] and [[Manhattan]]. The other well known and obvious nickname is [[Bankfurt]]. Before [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|World War II]] the city was globally noted for its unique [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|old town]] with timber-framed buildings, the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The [[R\u00f6mer]] area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as [[Christmas market]]s. Other parts of the old town are to be reconstructed as part of the [[Dom-R\u00f6mer Project]] by 2016.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Die Frankenfurt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The legend of the ''Frankenfurt'' (ford of the Franks)]]\n''Frankonovurd'' (in [[Old High German]]) or ''Vadum Francorum'' (in [[Latin]]) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to ''Frankenfort'' during the [[Middle Ages]] and then to ''Franckfort'' and ''Franckfurth'' in the [[modern history|modern era]]. According to historian [[David Gans]], the city was named {{c.}} 146 AD by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as [[Sicambri]]. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage.<ref>Dovid Solomon Ganz, ''Tzemach David'' (part 2), Warsaw 1859, p. 13b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: ''Cemahc Dawid''; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, ''Fredegar and the History of France'', University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536\u2013538.</ref> The name is derived from the ''Franconofurd'' of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Franks]]; ''Furt'' ([[cf.]] English ''[[ford (river)|ford]]'') where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.\n\nBy the 19th century, the name ''Frankfurt'' had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of ''Frankfort'' is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling (e.g., [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]; [[Frankfort (town), New York|Frankfort, New York]]; [[Frankfort, Illinois]]).\n\nThe suffix ''am Main'' has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of ''Frankfurt am Main'' means \"Frankfurt on the Main\" (pronounced like English ''mine'' or German ''mein''). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: ''{{Lang|de|Furt}}'') on the [[Main (river)|Main River]]. As a part of early [[Franconia]], the inhabitants were the early [[Franks]], thus the city's name reveals its legacy as \"the ford of the Franks on the Main\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&lpg=PA135&pg=PA135|title=Placenames of the world|last=Room|first=Adrian|publisher=McFarland|year=2006|page=135|accessdate=23 July 2009 | isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7}}</ref>\n\nAmong English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the [[States of Germany|''Land'']] of [[Brandenburg]] on the Polish border.\n\nThe city district [[Bonames]] has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from ''bona me(n)sa'' (good table).\n\nThe common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are ''Frankfurt (Main)'', ''Frankfurt (M)'', ''Frankfurt a. M.'', ''Frankfurt/Main'' or ''Frankfurt/M''. The common [[abbreviation]] for the name of the city is \"FFM\". Also in use is \"FRA\", the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for Frankfurt Airport.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Frankfurt am Main|Timeline of Frankfurt}}\n\n===Early history and Holy Roman Empire===\n[[Germania|Roman settlements]] were established in the area of the ''R\u00f6mer'', probably in the first century. ''Nida'' ([[Heddernheim]]) was also a Roman civitas capital.\n\n[[Alemanni]] and Franks [[Francia|lived there]], and by 794, [[Charlemagne]] presided over an [[Council of Frankfurt|imperial assembly]] and church synod, at which ''Franconofurd'' (alternative spellings end with -furt and -vurd) was first mentioned.\n\nFrankfurt was one of the most important cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 855, the [[List of German Kings and Emperors|German kings and emperors]] were elected and crowned in [[Aachen]]. From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned in Frankfurt, initiated for [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. This tradition ended in 1792, when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on [[Bastille Day]], 14 July, the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]]. The elections and coronations took place in [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholom\u00e4us Cathedral]], known as the ''Kaiserdom'' (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.\n\nThe ''[[Messe Frankfurt|Frankfurter Messe]]'' (Frankfurt Trade Fair) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Friedrich II]] granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs began in 1478.\n\nIn 1372, Frankfurt became a ''Reichsstadt'' ([[Imperial Free City]]), i.e., directly subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.\n\nIn 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of [[exchange rate]]s for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nFrankfurt managed to remain neutral during the [[Thirty Years' War]], but suffered from the [[bubonic plague]] that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theatre principal [[Abel Seyler]] was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mohr |first=Albert Richard |authorlink=Albert Richard Mohr|year=1967 |chapter=Abel Seyler und seine Verdienste um das Frankfurter Theaterleben|title= Frankfurter Theater von der Wandertruppe zum Kom\u00f6dienhaus: ein Beitrag zur Theatergeschichte des 18.

It remained a [[Free imperial city|free city]] until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the [[principality of Aschaffenburg]] under the ''F\u00fcrstprimas'' ([[Prince-Primate]]), [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]]. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the [[confederation of the Rhine]]. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] intended to make his adopted son [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], already ''Prince de Venise'' (\"[[prince of Venice]]\", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813, when the military tide turned in favour of the Anglo-Prussian lead allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favour of Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.\n\n===Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state===\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded [[German Confederation]] (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its ''Bundestag'', the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Emperor of Austria]] was represented by an Austrian \"presidential envoy\".\n\nAfter the ill-fated [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the [[Frankfurter Paulskirche]] (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. The institution failed in 1849 when the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]], declared that he would not accept \"a crown from the gutter\". In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch.\n\n===Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty===\n[[File:Courbet Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|''View of Frankfurt am Main'', including the [[Alte Br\u00fccke (Frankfurt)|Alte Br\u00fccke]] (Old Bridge), by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1858)]]\nFrankfurt lost its independence after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the [[Free City of Frankfurt]]. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of [[Hesse-Nassau]]. The Prussian occupation and annexation was perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of [[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] and [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] were incorporated in 1890.\n\nIn 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.\n\nFrom 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the [[Ruhr uprising]], [[French occupation of Frankfurt|Frankfurt was occupied by French troops]].<ref>[http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html Chronology: Emergence of a Modern City 1866\u20131945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085810/http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html |date=19 July 2011 }}.

About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|medieval city centre]], by that time the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a [[Battle of Frankfurt|ground battlefield]] on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] and the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]] of the [[United States Army]] captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946 |last=Stanton |first=Shelby |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811701570 |pages=57, 84}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-(Darmstadt)]] and the [[Province of Kurhessen|Prussian Hesse]] provinces. The city was part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of Occupation]] of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945\u20131949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949\u20131952) had their headquarters in the [[IG Farben Building]], intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.\n\nFrankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of [[West Germany]] in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of [[Hessischer Rundfunk]]). In the end, [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first postwar [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]], preferred the town of [[Bonn]], for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a [[German reunification|reunification]] with [[East Germany]] and the eventual return of the capital to [[Berlin]].\n\nPostwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., [[R\u00f6mer]], [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|St. Paul's Church]], and [[Goethe House]]). The collection of historically significant [[Cairo Genizah]] documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to [[Arabist]] and Genizah scholar [[S.D.

In 1948, the allies founded the [[Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder]], the forerunner of [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Dresdner Bank]]. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.\n\nFrankfurt also re-emerged as Germany's transportation centre and [[Frankfurt Airport]] became Europe's second-busiest airport behind [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1961.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Port of Frankfurt|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php|website=World Port Source|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> That system includes a suburban rail system ([[Frankfurt S-Bahn|S-Bahn]]) linking outlying communities with the city centre, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches ([[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.\n\nIn 1998, the [[European Central Bank]] was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]] in 2011.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:On_top_of_the_Main_Tower.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Top of [[Main Tower]] looking East]]\nIt is the largest city in the [[federated state]] of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany.\n\n===Site===\n[[File:Frankfurt Skyline with Cranes.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Frankfurt's skyline from across the Main, showing construction cranes]]\nFrankfurt is located on both sides of the [[Main (river)|Main River]], south-east of the [[Taunus]] mountain range.

Some like [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] and [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] arose during the rapid growth of the city in the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] following the [[Unification of Germany]], while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city district(s), such as [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] and [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]].\n\n===History of incorporations===\nUntil the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]], [[Gutleutviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Gutleutviertel]], [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]], [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]], [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]], [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] and [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].\n\n[[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] was part of an administrative district called ''Landkreis Frankfurt'', before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] on 1 April 1895.

The ''Landkreis Frankfurt'' was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore [[Berkersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Berkersheim]], [[Bonames (Frankfurt am Main)|Bonames]], [[Eckenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eckenheim]], [[Eschersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eschersheim]], [[Ginnheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], [[Hausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Hausen]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]], [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]], [[Preungesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Preungesheim]] and [[R\u00f6delheim (Frankfurt am Main)|R\u00f6delheim]] joined the City. In the same year a new city district, [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]], was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.\n\nOn 1 April 1928 the City of [[H\u00f6chst (Frankfurt am Main)|H\u00f6chst]] became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts [[Sindlingen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sindlingen]], [[Unterliederbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Unterliederbach]] and [[Zeilsheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Zeilsheim]]. Simultaneously the ''Landkreis H\u00f6chst'' was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt ([[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]], [[Griesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Griesheim]], [[Nied (Frankfurt am Main)|Nied]], [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]], [[Sossenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Sossenheim]]) or joining the newly established ''Landkreis'' of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]].\n\n[[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.\n\n[[File:Enkheimer Ried.jpg|thumb|[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Enkheimer]] Ried]]\nOn 1 August 1972 Hesse's smaller suburbs of [[Harheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Harheim]], [[Kalbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach]], [[Nieder-Erlenbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Erlenbach]], and [[Nieder-Eschbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Eschbach]] became districts while other neighbouring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the [[Landkreis Offenbach]], the [[Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau]], the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] or the [[Wetteraukreis]].\n\n[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bergen-Enkheim]] was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.\n\n[[Flughafen (Frankfurt am Main)|Flughafen]] became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighbouring city of [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]].\n\nFrankfurt's youngest city district is [[Frankfurter Berg]]. It was part of Bonames until 1996.\n\nKalbach was officially renamed [[Kalbach-Riedberg]] in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.\n\n===Neighbouring districts and cities===\n[[File:Locator map of Planungsverband Ballungsraum Frankfurt Rhein-Main in Hesse.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Frankfurt urban area within [[Hesse]]]]\n\nTo the west Frankfurt borders the [[Districts of Germany|administrative district]] (''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]] with towns such as [[Hattersheim am Main]], [[Kriftel]], [[Hofheim am Taunus]], [[Kelkheim (Taunus)|Kelkheim]], [[Liederbach am Taunus]], [[Sulzbach (Taunus)|Sulzbach]], [[Schwalbach am Taunus]] and [[Eschborn]]; to the northwest the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]], [[Oberursel (Taunus)]] and [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]]; to the north the [[Wetteraukreis]] with [[Karben]] and [[Bad Vilbel]]; to the northeast the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] with [[Niederdorfelden]] and [[Maintal]]; to the southeast the city of [[Offenbach am Main]]; to the south the [[Offenbach (district)|Kreis Offenbach]] with [[Neu-Isenburg]] and to the southwest the [[Gro\u00df-Gerau (district)|Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau]] with [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]] and [[Kelsterbach]].\n\nTogether with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., [[Hanau]], [[Rodgau]], [[Dreieich]], [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called ''Stadtregion Frankfurt'' which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3&nbsp;million in 2010 and is therefore the [[Largest urban areas in the European Union|13th largest urban area in the European Union]].\n\n===Climate===\nFrankfurt has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]-[[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''). Its average annual temperature is {{convert|10.6|\u00b0C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|1.6|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|20.0|\u00b0C|1}} in July.\n\n{{Weather

With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before [[World War II]]. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 825,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2020 and more than 2.5&nbsp;million inhabitants in its urban area.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the state government of [[Hesse]] wanted to include the entire urban area into its administrative boundaries. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.<ref>H.

However, during the 19th century an increasing number of [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholics]] moved there. The Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Germany. Two synagogues operate there. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Frankfurt has a large Muslim community.

The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbours. The ''Kaisersaal'' (\"Emperor's Hall\") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The R\u00f6mer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the R\u00f6merberg, is named after the city hall.\n\nThe former [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) quarter between the R\u00f6mer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was to be redeveloped as the [[Dom-R\u00f6mer Project|Dom-R\u00f6mer Quarter]] through 2016, including [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructions]] of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.\n\n'''Frankfurt Cathedral'''\n\n[[Frankfurt Cathedral]] (Frankfurter Dom) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]]. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the [[Merovingian]] time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman-German]] emperors were crowned there.\n\nSince the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called ''Dom'', although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 meters. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 meters, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Frankfurt Am Main-St Bartholomaeus-Ansicht vom Nextower-20110812.jpg\n| width1 = 300\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = <center>[[Frankfurt Cathedral]]</center>\n| image2 = Frankfurt Am Main-Samstagsberg von Suedwesten-20110705.jpg\n| width2 = 300\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = <center>[[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]]</center>\n| image3 = Frankfurt Paulskirche au\u00dfen 2011a.jpg\n| width3 = 200\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = <center>[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]]</center>\n| footer = \n}}\n\n'''St. Paul's Church'''\n\n[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]] (''Paulskirche'') is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a [[Protestant]] church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of [[Prussia]] and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849 Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved. Afterwards, the building was used for church services again.\n\nSt. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II, particularly its interior, which now has a modern appearance. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.\n\n[[File:Frankfurt Hauptwache View.jpg|thumb|right|The view towards downtown Frankfurt from [[Zeil]] shopping street]]\n\n'''Arch\u00e4ologischer Garten Frankfurt'''\n\nThe Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (''Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt'') from the 6th century. The garden is located between the R\u00f6merberg and the Cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. There are plans underway to construct a building on top of the garden but anyhow it is decided that the garden will stay open to the public.\n\n'''Haus Wertheim'''\n\nWertheim House is the only [[Timber framing|timbered house]] in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the R\u00f6merberg next to the Historical Museum.\n\n'''Saalhof'''\n\nThe [[Saalhof]] is the oldest conserved building in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch [[cloth merchant|clothiers]] when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th century. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the [[Historical museum, Frankfurt|Historical Museum]].\n\n'''Eiserner Steg'''\n\nThe Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects R\u00f6merberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the [[Wehrmacht]], it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.\n\n[[File:Alte Oper Frankfurt Winter 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Alte Oper]], now a concert hall, at Opernplatz]]\n\n'''Alte Oper'''\n\nThe [[Alte Oper]] is a former [[opera house]], hence the name \"Old Opera\". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed \"Germany's most beautiful ruin\". Former Frankfurt [[Lord Mayor]] Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname \"Dynamite-Rudi\". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)\n\nPublic pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the \"new\" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the [[frieze]] of the Alte Oper says: \"''Dem Wahren, Sch\u00f6nen, Guten''\" (\"To the true, the beautiful, the good\").\n\n'''Eschenheimer Turm'''\n\nThe Eschenheim Tower (''[[Eschenheimer Turm]]'') was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district.\n\n'''[[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]'''\n\nSt. Catherine's Church (''Katharinenkirche'') is the largest [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant]] church, dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]], a [[martyr]]ed early Christian saint. It is located in the city centre at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.\n\n'''Hauptwache'''\n\nAlthough today [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|of the same name]], the name originates from a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as \"main guard-house\". Today the square surrounding the building is also called \"Hauptwache\" (formal: ''An der Hauptwache''). It is situated in the city centre opposite to St. Catherine's Church and houses a famous caf\u00e9.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Frankfurt Main Hauptwache Katharinenkirche 20120707.jpg\n| width1 = 300\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = <center>[[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] and [[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]</center>\n| image2 = Frankfurt Nextower.20130514.jpg\n| width2 = 130\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = <center>[[Eschenheimer Turm]]</center>\n| image3 = Frankfurt Main Hauptbahnhof 6229.jpg\n| width3 = 300\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = <center>[[Frankfurt Central Station]]</center>\n| footer = \n}}\n\n'''Central Station'''\n\n[[Frankfurt Central Station]] (''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof''), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller train stations in the city centre and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a [[Terminal station|terminus station]] and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof|Leipzig Central Station]] was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neorenaissance]]-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]]-style.\n\n'''Frankfurter Hof'''\n\nThe Frankfurter Hof is a landmarked hotel in the city centre at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876.

The state apparatus of the [[West Germany|Federal German Government]] was devised there. It served as the headquarters for the [[U.S. V Corps|US Army's V Corps]] and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995 when the US Army returned control of the IG Farben Building to the German government.

The first building to exceed the 95-metre-high cathedral was not an office building but a [[grain silo]], the {{convert|120|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Henninger Turm]], built from 1959 to 1961.\n\nThe first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when [[Westend Gate]] (then called ''Plaza B\u00fcro Center'') and [[Silberturm]] were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 metres and 166.3 metres, respectively. Around the same time, [[Frankfurter B\u00fcro Center]] and [[City-Haus]] (142.4 metres and 142.1 metres) were constructed at Mainzer Landstra\u00dfe and [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] (148.0 metres) and [[Garden Tower]] (127.0 metres; then called ''Helaba-Hochhaus'') were constructed in the financial district.\n\nNone of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the [[Deutsche Bank Twin Towers]] at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 metres tall.\n\nThe 1990s featured a second wave. [[Messeturm]], built on the trade fair site, reached a height of 256.5 metres and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the {{convert|259|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Commerzbank Tower]] in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are [[Westendstrasse 1]] (208.0 metres), [[Main Tower]] (200.0 metres) and [[Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)|Trianon]] (186.0 metres).\n\nIn 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., [[Skyper]], [[Opernturm]], [[Tower 185]], [[Seat of the European Central Bank]], [[Taunusturm]]) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.\n\n===Other tall structures===\n[[File:Europaturm Abend.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the [[Europaturm]], a 337&nbsp;m communications tower]]\n* '''[[Europaturm]] \u2014''' The Europe Tower is a [[Radio masts and towers|telecommunications tower]], also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 metres it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]]. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the \"Ginnheimer Spargel\" (''Ginnheim Asparagus''), but stands a few metres within [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district.\n* '''[[Henninger Turm]] \u2014''' The Henninger Tower was a 120-metre-high [[grain silo]] built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by [[Henninger Brewery]]. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 metres and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 metres. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140&nbsp;m (459&nbsp;ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm, and will contain 130 luxury apartments. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and was expected to be completed sometime in 2016. From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly [[Road bicycle racing|cycling race]] was named after the tower, the \"Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm\" (''Cycling race around Henninger Tower''). The now-renamed race is still a yearly event.\n* '''[[Goethe Tower|Goetheturm \u2014]]''' The Goethe Tower was a {{convert|43|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower on the northern edge of the [[Frankfurt City Forest]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It was the fifth tallest wood construction structure in Germany. It was built in 1931 and was a popular place for day-trippers until it burned down in 2017.

It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by two large public squares, [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] in the west and [[Konstablerwache]] in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the [[Kaufingerstra\u00dfe]] in [[Munich]]. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as [[H&M]], [[Saturn (store)|Saturn]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]], [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]] or [[NewYorker]]. In 2009 a new shopping mall named [[MyZeil]] opened there with nearly 100 stores and chains like [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]]. Three more shopping malls occupy the Zeil: [[Zeilgalerie]], [[Metro AG|Galeria Kaufhof]] and [[Arcandor|Karstadt]], as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from [[Peek & Cloppenburg]] and [[C&A]]. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to [[Frankfurt Christmas Market]], one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany.\n* '''[[Goethestra\u00dfe]]''' \u2013 Frankfurt's most expensive shopping street with prestigious shops like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Versace]], [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Burberry]], [[Vertu]] and [[Bulgari]]. It is located between the financial district and the city centre and runs from Goetheplatz to Opernplatz.\n* [[Fre\u00dfgass]] \u2013 (officially ''Kalb\u00e4cher Gasse'' and ''Gro\u00dfe Bockenheimer Stra\u00dfe'') is a pedestrian-only street section between B\u00f6rsenstra\u00dfe and Opernplatz in the city centre. The name translates as \"feeding alley\" because of its high concentration of gastronomy, but lately prestigious shops (e.g., [[Apple Store]], [[Hugo Boss]], [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche Design]]) have moved here due to the lack of space in the neighbouring [[Goethestra\u00dfe]], displacing old, established restaurants, butchers and delicatessens.\n* '''Berger Stra\u00dfe ''' \u2013 Frankfurt's longest shopping street. It starts in the city center, runs through [[Nordend, Frankfurt|Nordend]] and [[Bornheim (Frankfurt)|Bornheim]] and ends in [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]].

It runs parallel to M\u00fcnchener Stra\u00dfe from the central station to the financial district. Kaiserstra\u00dfe is still a synonym for Frankfurt's [[Red-light district]] although [[Sex industry|sex-oriented businesses]] moved to neighbouring streets such as Taunusstra\u00dfe in the 1990s. Today Kaiserstra\u00dfe houses many smaller shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n* '''Kleinmarkthalle ''' \u2013 (literally: ''Small Market Hall'') is a market hall in the city centre close to Konstablerwache offering fresh food and flowers.

The Green Belt is a [[protected area]] which means that housing is not allowed. The Green Belt was formally created in 1991 with its own constitution.\n* '''Mainuferpark ''' \u2013 The Mainuferpark (''Main Riverbanks Park'') is the common term to describe the inner-city Main riverbanks. It is an auto-free zone with large green areas that is popular with strollers and tourists, especially in the summertime, when it can become crowded. The southern riverbank, which continues further to [[Offenbach am Main]] and [[Hanau]], offers the best skyline views. The northern riverbank ends in the west at the former Westhafen (''West Harbour'', a residential housing area) and is growing to the east: A former industrial-used area between the future [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] and the Osthafen (''East Harbour'') was to become a park named Hafenpark (''Harbour Park'').\n* '''Wallanlagen ''' \u2013 The [[Wallanlagen]] (former ''[[Defensive wall|ramparts]]'') relate to the former ring-shaped [[Defensive wall|city wall fortifications]] around the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district (abolished 1804\u20131812), now a series of parks. Building is not allowed, with a few exceptions, the most famous being the [[Alte Oper]] (built 1880) at the Opernplatz. The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as \"Central Park\" (a reference to the [[Central Park|famous park]] in [[Manhattan]]), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.\n* '''Nizza Park ''' \u2013 At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza.

Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt city tunnel and serve the stations [[Frankfurt Ostendstra\u00dfe station|Ostendstra\u00dfe]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Konstablerwache station|Konstablerwache]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache]], [[Taunusanlage station|Taunusanlage]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station]]. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[Darmstadt]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]], [[Hanau]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Oberursel]], [[Bad Homburg]], [[Kronberg]], [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] and smaller towns that are on the way.\nThe S8/S9 runs 24/7.\n\n====U-Bahn====\n{{main|Frankfurt U-Bahn}}\nThe [[U-Bahn]] has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact [[light rail]] (''[[Stadtbahn]]'') as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5 to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3 and 5-minute intervals on city centre tracks shared by more than one line.\n\n====Tram====\n{{main|Trams in Frankfurt am Main}}\nFrankfurt has ten [[tram]] lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes. Many sections are served by two lines, combining to run at 5-minute intervals during rush-hour. Trams only run above ground and serve more stops than the U-Bahn or the S-Bahn.\n\n====Bus====\n{{main|Public transport in Frankfurt am Main#Bus}}\nA number of [[bus]] lines complete the Frankfurt public transport system. Night buses replace U-Bahn and tram services between 1:30&nbsp;am and 3:30&nbsp;am.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nachtbus-frankfurt.de |title=Nightbus Frankfurt Rheinmain |publisher=Nachtbus-frankfurt.de |accessdate=10 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430194211/http://www.nachtbus-frankfurt.de/ |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The central junction for the night bus service is Konstablerwache in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\n\n===Taxis===\n[[Taxicab]]s can usually be found outside the major S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, at the central station, the south station, the airport, the trade fair and in the crowded inner-city shopping streets. The common way to obtain a taxi is to either call a taxi operator or to go to a taxi rank. However, although not the norm, one can hail a passing taxi on the street.\n\n[[Uber]] ceased operations in Frankfurt on 9 November 2015 after operating in the city for 18 months.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Uber Pulls Out of Three German Cities After Court Ban Shrinks Driver Pool | url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/uber-retrenches-in-germany/ | first=Natasha | last=Lomas | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=2 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Bicycles===\n[[File:Frankfurt Velotaxi.jpg|thumb|Velotaxi at the Zeil]]\n[[Deutsche Bahn]] makes bicycles available for hire through their [[Call a Bike]] service.

To rent a specific bike, riders either call a service number to get an unlock code or reserve the bike via the smartphone application. To return the bike, the rider locks it within a designated return area (and calls the service number, if not booked via the app).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/|title=Call a Bike: Startseite|work=callabike-interaktiv.de}}</ref>\n\n[[Nextbike]] also makes bicycles available for hire in Frankfurt.

These are allowed to operate in pedestrian-only areas and are therefore practical for sightseeing.\n\nFrankfurt has a network of cycle routes. Many long-distance bike routes into the city have cycle tracks that are separate from motor vehicle traffic. A number of roads in the city centre are \"bicycle streets\" where the cyclist has the right of way and where motorised vehicles are only allowed access if they do not disrupt the cycle users. In addition, cyclists are allowed to ride many cramped one-way streets in both directions. {{As of|2015}}, 15 percent of citizens used bicycles.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Radfahrb\u00fcro der Stadt Frankfurt|url = http://www.radfahren-ffm.de/|website = www.radfahren-ffm.de|accessdate = 5 September 2015|first = Stadt Frankfurt am Main \u2013 Der Oberb\u00fcrgermeister \u2013 Stra\u00dfenverkehrsamt Radfahrb\u00fcro|last = 36.31.5}}</ref>\n\n==Economy and business==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\nFrankfurt is one of the world's most important [[financial centre]]s and Germany's financial capital, followed by [[Munich's financial community|Munich]].

The ECB sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, consisting of 19 [[European Union]] [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] that have adopted the [[Euro]] (\u20ac) as their common currency. From 1998 the ECB Headquarters have been located in Frankfurt, first in the [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] at Willy-Brandt-Platz and in two other nearby high-rises. The new [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] in the [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] district, consisting of the former wholesale market hall (''[[Gro\u00dfmarkthalle]]'') and a newly built 185-metre skyscraper, was completed in late 2014. The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometres away from the city centre and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (''East Harbour''), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.\n\nThe city honours the importance of the ECB by officially using the slogan \"The City of the Euro\" since 1998.\n\n====Deutsche Bundesbank====\nThe [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] (German Federal Bank), located in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], was established in 1957 as the central bank for the Federal Republic of Germany.

For example, John's big nose is inalienably possessed because it cannot (without surgery) be removed from John; it is simply a quality that he has. In contrast, 'John's briefcase' is alienably possessed because it can be separated from John.\n\nMany languages make the distinction as part of their grammar, typically by using different affixes for alienable and inalienable possession. For example, in [[Mikasuki language|Mikasuki]] (a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]] language of [[Florida]]), ''ac-akni'' (inalienable) means 'my body', but ''am-akni'' (alienable) means 'my meat'.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Languages of Native North America|last=Mithun|first=Marianne|publisher=CUP|year=1999|ISBN=0-521-29875-X|page=465}}</ref> English does not have any way of making such distinctions (the example from Mikasuki is clear to English-speakers only because there happen to be two different words in English that translate ''-akni'' in the two senses: both Mikasuki words could be translated as 'my flesh', and the distinction would then disappear in English).\n \nPossessive pronouns in [[Polynesian languages]] such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] and [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] are associated with nouns distinguishing between [[Polynesian languages#a and o possession|''o''-class, ''a''-class and neutral pronouns]], according to the relationship of possessor and possessed.

In languages that mark the distinction, inherently-possessed nouns, such as parts of wholes, cannot be mentioned without indicating their dependent status. [[Yabem language|Yagem]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], for instance, distinguishes alienable from inalienable possession when the possessor is human, but it distinguishes inherent from non-inherent possession when the possessor'  is not human. Inherently-possessed nouns are marked with the prefix ''\u014ba-'', as in ''(ka) \u014balaka'' '(tree) branch', ''(l\u00f4m) \u014batau'' '(men's house) owner' and ''(talec) \u014balatu'' '(hen's) chick'. Adjectives that are derived from nouns (as inherent attributes of other entities) are also so marked, as in ''\u014badani'' 'thick, dense' (from ''dani'' 'thicket') or ''\u014balemo\u014b'' 'muddy, soft' (from ''lemo\u014b'' 'mud').\n\n==Possessable and unpossessable==\nMany languages, such as [[Maasai language|Maasai]], distinguish between the possessable and the unpossessable. Possessable things include farm animals, tools, houses, family members and money, but wild animals, landscape features and weather phenomena are examples of what cannot be possessed. That means basically that in such languages, saying ''my sister'' is grammatically correct but not ''my land''. Instead, one would have to use a circumlocution such as ''the land that I own''.\n\n==Greater and lesser possession (in quantity)==\nGreater and lesser possession (in quantity) is used in Modern [[Mansi language|Mansi]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Locative possession==\nLocative possessive is used in some [[Uralic languages]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Clauses denoting possession==\n===Possession verbs===\nMany languages have [[verb]]s that can be used to form [[clause (grammar)|clause]]s denoting possession. For example, English uses the verb ''have'' for that purpose, French uses ''avoir'' etc. There are often alternative ways of expressing such relationships (for example, the verbs ''possess'' and ''belong'', among others, can be used in English in appropriate contexts: see also ''[[have got]]'').\n  \nIn some languages, different possession verbs are used depending on whether the object is [[animacy|animate or inanimate]]. Compare the two examples in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]:\n\n:''Kompiuteri '''makvs''''' (\"I have a computer\")\n:''Dzaghli '''mqavs''''' (\"I have a dog\")\n\nSince a dog is animate and a computer is not, different verbs are used. However some nouns in Georgian, such as ''car'', are treated as animate even though they appear to refer to an inanimate object.\n\n=== Possession indicated by existential clauses ===\nIn some languages, possession relationships are indicated by [[existential clause]]s. For example, in [[Russian language|Russian]], \"I have a friend\" can be expressed by the sentence \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 ''u menya yest drug'', which literally means \"at me there is a friend\".\n\nIncluding [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as well as [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], they use an existential clause to assess a possession since the verb ''to have'' does not have that function.\n\nFor more examples, see {{slink|Existential clause|Indicating possession}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Genitive case]]\n* [[Possessive adjective]]\n* [[Possessive case]]\n* [[Possessive pronoun]]\n* [[Possessive suffix]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Bernd Heine|Heine, Bernd]] (1997) ''Possession: Cognitive sources, forces, and grammaticalization''.

The term ''racism'' is a noun describing the state of being racist, i.e., subscribing to the belief that the human population can or should be classified into races with differential abilities and dispositions, which in turn may motivate a political ideology in which rights and privileges are differentially distributed based on racial categories. The origin of the root word \"race\" is not clear. Linguists generally agree that it came to the English language from [[Middle French]], but there is no such agreement on how it generally came into Latin-based languages.

[[Discourse analysis]] seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study of the ways in which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. For example, Van Dijk (1992) examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analyzing Racism Through Discourse Analysis Some Methodological Reflections in Race and Ethnicity in Research Methods |publisher=Sage |author=Van Dijk, Tuen |year=1992 |location=Newbury Park, CA |pages=92\u2013134 |isbn=978-0-8039-5007-8}}</ref> He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early [[African-American literature]] that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the [[Southern United States|South]] as an African American.\n\nMuch American fictional literature has focused on issues of racism and the black \"racial experience\" in the US, including works written by whites, such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'', or even the non-fiction work ''[[Black Like Me]]''. These books, and others like them, feed into what has been called the \"[[white savior narrative in film]]\", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. [[Content analysis|Textual analysis]] of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African American writers have sometimes been portrayed in [[African-American studies]] as retreating from racial issues when they write about \"[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]\", while others identify this as an African American literary tradition called \"the literature of white estrangement\", part of a multi-pronged effort to challenge and dismantle [[white supremacy]] in the US.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whiteness |publisher=The University Press of Mississippi |author=Watson, Veronica T. |year=2013 |location=Jackson |page=137 |isbn=978-1-4968-0245-3}}</ref>\n\n===Popular usage===\nAccording to dictionaries, the word is commonly used to describe prejudice and discrimination based on race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism|title=Definition of racism in English|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism|title=Definition of racism|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nRacism can also be said to describe a condition in society in which a dominant racial group benefits from the [[oppression]] of others, whether that group wants such benefits or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 |title='Reverse Racism': 4 Myths That Need To Stop |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |author=Blay, Zeba |publisher=Huffpost Black Voices}}</ref> Foucauldian scholar Ladelle McWhorter, in her 2009 book, ''Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America: A Genealogy'', posits modern racism similarly, focusing on the notion of a dominant group, usually whites, vying for racial purity and progress, rather than an overt or obvious ideology focused on the oppression of nonwhites.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Racism and sexual oppression in Anglo-America: a genealogy |last=McWhorter |first=Ladelle |year=2009 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-35296-5 |location=Bloomington |oclc=406565635}}</ref>\n\nIn popular usage, as in some academic usage, little distinction is made between \"racism\" and \"[[ethnocentrism]]\".

The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of aversive racism. Aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36001-6 |chapter=Aversive Racism |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |year=2004 |last1=Dovidio |first1=John F. |last2=Gaertner |first2=Samuel L. |isbn=978-0-12-015236-0 |volume=36 |pages=1\u201352 |editor1-first=James M. |editor1-last=Olson |editor2-first=Mark P. |editor2-last=Zanna}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0901_1 |title=Differences in Helping Whites and Blacks: A Meta-Analysis |year=2005 |last1=Saucier |first1=Donald A. |last2=Miller |first2=Carol T. |last3=Doucet |first3=Nicole |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=9 |pages=2\u201316 |pmid=15745861 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Color blindness===\n{{main|Color blindness (race)}}\nIn relation to racism, color blindness is the disregard of racial characteristics in [[social interaction]], for example in the rejection of affirmative action, as a way to address the results of past patterns of discrimination.

To objectify a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like 'normal' society.

Another early view in scientific racism was the [[Polygenism|polygenist view]], which held that the different races had been separately created. Polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]] for example, split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the \"beautiful White race\" and the \"ugly Black race\". In Meiners' book, ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like.\n\n[[Anders Retzius]] demonstrated that neither Europeans nor others are one \"pure race\", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for the classification of the population in the United States. [[Hans Peder Steensby]], while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the \"purest race\" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=[[Danish Journal of Geography|Geografisk Tidsskrift]] |volume=19 |language=Danish |year=1907 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref>\n\nScientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and [[nation]]al [[archetype|stereotypes]] are accepted.\n\nAlthough after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], racist ideologies were discredited on ethical, political and scientific grounds, racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world. \n\n[[W.E.B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] observed that it is not so much \"race\" that we think about, but culture: \"...&nbsp;a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=Du Bois|first=W.E.B. |year=1897 |page=21 }}</ref> Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on \"race\", ethnicity, and \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.<ref>{{cite book| author = Marius Turda| title = The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880\u20131918| year = 2004| publisher = Edwin Mellen Press| isbn = 978-0-7734-6180-2 }}</ref> According to this view, [[culture]] is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination \"Germanic\" was equivalent to superiority of race.\n\nBolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: \"[r]acism does not originate from the existence of 'races'. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences.\"<ref>National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for Italy \u2013 Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216225620/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, which is still subject to scientific debate.

Many use the term \"racism\" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from scientific racism, which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and [[nationalism]] were harnessed in order to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).\n\nNotions of race and racism have often played central roles in [[ethnic conflict]]s. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as \"other\" based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when \"other\" is interpreted to mean \"inferior\"), the means employed by the self-presumed \"superior\" party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of \"the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other\".<ref>Richter, ''Facing East from Indian Country'', p.&nbsp;208</ref> [[Basil Davidson]] states in his documentary, ''Africa: Different but Equal'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.\n\nHistorically, racism was a major driving force behind the [[Transatlantic slave trade]].<ref>Fredrickson, George M. 1988. ''The Arrogance of Race: Historical Perspectives on Slavery, Racism, and Social Inequality''.

[[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution]]aries, thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792\u20131802) and then to the conquests of [[Napoleon]], and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The [[Westphalia Treaty]] had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms (such as the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Swedish Empire]], the [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).\n\nModern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808\u20131813, known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the \"nationalities question\" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation, after [[World War I]], of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s, with \"national [[minorities]]\" in their borders.<ref>On this \"[[nationalities]] question\" and the problem of nationalism, see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789\u20131848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990\u20131992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.</ref>\n\n[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.\n\nOne of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744\u20131803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762\u20131814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798\u20131874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823\u20131892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together (\"the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]\", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806\u20131873).<ref>[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861</ref>\nEthnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with \"continental [[imperialist]]\" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951<ref name=\"Arendt\">[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)</ref>) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German ''[[Volk]]'' (people/folk). The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]] and \"[[racial hygiene]]\", and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jews]]. Another popular current, the ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse, and it combined Pan-Germanism with modern [[racial antisemitism]]. Members of the V\u00f6lkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; commonly known in English as the Nazi party). Pan-Germanism played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s\u20131930s.<ref name=Arendt />\n\nThese currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a \"[[master race]]\" (often the \"[[Aryan race]]\" or the \"[[Nordic race]]\") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called \"races\", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a \"race struggle\" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]], in order to achieve \"racial purity\" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.\n\nSuch racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nationwide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[\u00c9mile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (1862\u20131923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.<ref>[[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], ''Le Roman de l'\u00e9nergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)</ref> At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868\u20131952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' movement, theorized the \"anti-France\", composed of the \"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners\" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all \"internal foreigners\", who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].\n\n=={{anchor|In history}}History==\n\n===Ethnocentrism and proto-racism===\n[[File:Ksenophontov noah.jpg|thumb|The [[Book of Genesis]]'s biblical curse on [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]], which was often misinterpreted as [[Curse of Ham|a curse on his father]] [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], was used to justify [[Slavery in the United States|slavery in 19th century America]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hess|first1=Richard S.|title=The Old Testament: A Historical, Theological, and Critical Introduction|date=2016|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-1-4934-0573-2|page=59|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=kfvBDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT59|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Bernard Lewis]] has cited the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] who, in his discussion of [[slavery]], stated that while [[Greeks]] are free by nature, \"[[barbarian]]s\" (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to a [[Despotism|despotic]] government.<ref name=Lewis /> Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from nations outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/raceslaveryinmid0000lewi/page/54 54\u201355]| url = https://archive.org/details/raceslaveryinmid0000lewi/page/54}}</ref> While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |title=Aristotle on Slavery |publisher=Oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906070456/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |archivedate=September 6, 2013 }}</ref> This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist [[Benjamin Isaac]].\n\nSuch proto-racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context, because a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority (with modern racism based on [[eugenics]] and scientific racism) was not yet developed and it is unclear whether Aristotle believed the natural inferiority of Barbarians was caused by environment and climate (like many of his contemporaries) or by birth.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jfylyRawl8EC&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=aristotle+racism#v=onepage&q=aristotle%20racism&f=false |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |first=Benjamin H. |last=Isaac |authorlink=Benjamin Isaac |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate=2013-11-14|isbn=978-0-691-12598-5 |year=2006 |page=175 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian Dante A.

Robert Lacey explains:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin\u2014proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a [[white people|white]] man\u2014Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.<ref>Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats''.

Boulainvilliers, who created the matrix of such racist discourse in [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]], conceived of the \"race\" as being something closer to the sense of a \"nation\", that is, in his time, the \"race\" meant the \"people\".\n\nHe conceived of France as being divided between various nations \u2013 the unified [[nation-state]] is an [[anachronism]] here \u2013 which themselves formed different \"races\". Boulainvilliers opposed the [[absolute monarchy]], which tried to bypass the [[aristocracy]] by establishing a direct relationship to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Thus, he developed the theory that the French aristocrats were the descendants of foreign invaders, whom he called the \"[[Franks]]\", while according to him, the Third Estate constituted the autochthonous, vanquished [[Gallo-Romans]], who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the [[right of conquest]]. Early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation-state: the [[Fran\u00e7ois Dominique de Reynaud de Montlosier|Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the [[French Revolution]], who borrowed Boulainvilliers' discourse on the \"Nordic race\" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian \"Gauls\", thus showed his contempt for the Third Estate, calling it \"this new people born of slaves&nbsp;...

Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval \"historical and political discourse of race struggle\". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of \"race\", and they also transformed this popular discourse into a \"[[state racism]]\" (e.g., Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxists|Marxism]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of \"race\" into the historical notion of \"[[class struggle]]\", defined by socially structured positions: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the \"race struggle\" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concept of \"blood [[heredity]]\", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.\n\nAuthors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') which developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904\u20131907 or the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915\u20131917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem, ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899), is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.\n\n[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century illustration from ''Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View'' by H.

The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.\n\nThese racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of \"[[survival of the fittest]]\", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the \"lowest savages\" with European civilization.<ref name=\"dom\">{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1871 |publisher=John Murray|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=245 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Desmond| first = Adrian| author2 = James Richard Moore| title = Darwin| year = 1991| publisher = Michael Joseph, Penguin Group| isbn = 978-0-7181-3430-3| oclc = 185764721 }} pp. 28, 147, 580.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of \"[[degeneration]] of the race\" and \"blood [[heredity]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism, and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.\n\nBefore being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.\n\nThe neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s. According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.<ref name=\"ornl\">{{cite web | title = Minorities, Race, and Genomics| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml | accessdate = 2009-05-12}}</ref>\n\n===Heredity and eugenics===\n{{Further|Eugenics}}\nThe first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822\u20131911), who used the then-popular concept of ''[[degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged \"[[inheritance of intelligence]]\", foreshadowing future uses of \"[[intelligence testing]]\" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]] (1840\u20131902), who started publishing in 1871, a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eug\u00e8ne Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La B\u00eate humaine]]'').\n\nDuring the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.<ref>[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950</ref> According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:\n\n<blockquote>\n...up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Bene\u0161|Bene\u0161]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race&nbsp;... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as the [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the [[Porajmos|Romani Holocaust]]) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.\n\n===Polygenism and racial typologies===\n{{Further|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)}}\n[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|right|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the \"present distribution of European races\", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow.]]\nWorks such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853\u20131855) may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]].\n\nGobineau's theories would be expanded in France by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854\u20131936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white \"[[Aryan]] race\" \"[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]\", was opposed to the \"brachycephalic\" race, of whom the \"[[Jew]]\" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races, in which he identified the \"''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the \"''[[Homo alpinus]]''\" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the \"''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''\" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's \"selectionism\" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a \"degenerate\"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His \"anthroposociology\" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order.<ref>Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan).

They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about \"which side\" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.\n\nTheir colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[Memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes mis-attributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the \"correct\" speaker, although they also sometimes mis-attributed a statement to a speaker \"on the same side\" as the \"correct\" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the \"sides\" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.<ref name=\"KurzbanToobyCosmides2001ErasingRace\">{{cite journal |title=Can race be erased?

By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] \u2013 [[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].\n\n[[File:The Chinese Must Go - Magic Washer - 1886 anti-Chinese US cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|19th century [[political cartoon]]: ''[[Uncle Sam]] kicks out the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]'', referring to the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].]]\n\nLegislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of [[South Africa]] during its [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here, a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa|Apartheid legislation]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, from using certain public transportation, and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently than white South Africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as \"dom passes\", to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal [[human rights]] laws which were passed at the end of the [[Apartheid]] era in the early 1990s.\n\n==Anti-racism==\n{{Main|Anti-racism}}\n[[File:Anti-racist-rally-Sydney-2005-Dec-18-small.jpeg|thumb|An anti-racism rally held outside [[Sydney Town Hall]], December 2005.]]\n\nAnti-racism includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies which are adopted or developed in order to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against on the basis of race. Movements such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were examples of anti-racist movements. [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes embraced as an element of anti-racist movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy which is intended to suppress racism.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Afrophobia]]\n* [[Allport's Scale]]\n* [[Anti-racism]]\n* [[Aporophobia]]\n* [[Christian Identity]]\n* [[Creativity (religion)]]\n* [[Curse and mark of Cain]]\n* [[Curse of Ham]]\n* [[Discrimination based on skin color]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Environmental racism in Europe]]\n* [[Ethnic conflict]]\n* [[Ethnic hatred]]\n* [[Ethnocentrism]]\n* [[Holocaust]]\n* [[Identitarianism]]\n* [[Index of racism-related articles]]\n* [[In-group favoritism]]\n* [[Labeling theory]]\n* [[Nigger]]\n* [[Negro]]\n* [[Objectification|Objectification of people]]\n* [[Racial bias in criminal news]]\n* [[Racial discrimination]]\n* [[Racial fetishism]]\n* [[Racialism]]\n* [[Racial literacy]]\n* [[Racial segregation]]\n* [[Racialization]]\n* [[Raciolinguistics]]\n* [[Pre-Adamite#Racist pre-Adamism|Racist pre-Adamism]]\n* [[Racism in horror films]]\n* [[Racism in the LGBT community]]\n* [[Reverse discrimination]]\n* [[Reverse racism]]\n* [[Romantic racism]]\n* [[Scientific racism]]\n* [[Structural racism]]\n* [[Social interpretations of race]]\n* [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations]]\n* [[Stereotype threat]]\n* [[Tatarophobia]]\n* [[Tragic mulatto]]\n* [[Tribalism]]\n* [[Yellow Peril]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Allen, Theodore.

Therefore, ''racism'' and ''[[racial discrimination]]'' are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial.

The term ''racism'' is a noun describing the state of being racist, i.e., subscribing to the belief that the human population can or should be classified into races with differential abilities and dispositions, which in turn may motivate a political ideology in which rights and privileges are differentially distributed based on racial categories. The origin of the root word \"race\" is not clear. Linguists generally agree that it came to the English language from [[Middle French]], but there is no such agreement on how it generally came into Latin-based languages. A recent proposal is that it derives from the [[Arabic]] ''ra's'', which means \"head, beginning, origin\" or the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''rosh'', which has a similar meaning.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=race (n2) |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> Early race theorists generally held the view that some races were inferior to others and they consequently believed that the differential treatment of races was fully justified.<ref name=\"Garner09\"/><ref name=\"Canadian Encyclo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racism/ |title=Racism |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=21 February 2016 |year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/combating_discrimination/l33178_en.htm|website=Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008|publisher=European Union|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |website=UN Treaty Series |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=3 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804043913/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |archivedate=4 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> These early theories guided [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] research assumptions; the collective endeavors to adequately define and form hypotheses about racial differences are generally termed [[scientific racism]], though this term is a misnomer, due to the lack of any actual science backing the claims.\n\nToday, most [[Biology|biologists]], [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], and [[Sociology|sociologists]] reject a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of races in favor of more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as [[geography]], ethnicity, or a history of [[endogamy]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Does Race Exist? |journal=Scientific American |date=December 2003 |first=Michael |last=Bamshad |author2=Steve E.

This means that, although the concepts of race and racism are based on observable biological characteristics, any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies. Racism, as an ideology, exists in a society at both the [[individual]] and [[institution]]al level.\n\nWhile much of the research and work on racism during the last half-century or so has concentrated on \"white racism\" in the Western world, historical accounts of race-based social practices can be found across the globe.<ref name=Gossett>Gossett, Thomas F.

In studies of these majority white societies, the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed \"[[white privilege]]\".\n\nRace and race relations are prominent areas of study in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. Much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism. Some of the earliest sociological works on racism were penned by sociologist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from [[Harvard University]]. Du Bois wrote, \"[t]he problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the [[color line (civil rights issue)|color line]].\"<ref name=\"DuBois03\">{{cite book |title=The Souls of Black Folk |publisher=Bantam Classic |author1=Du Bois |author2=W.E.B. |year=1903 |location=New York|title-link=The Souls of Black Folk }}</ref> Wellman (1993) defines racism as \"culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities\".<ref name=\"Wellman\">{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=David T. |title=Portraits of White Racism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |location=New York |page=x}}</ref> In both sociology and economics, the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the [[Social inequality|inequality]] in [[income]], [[wealth]], [[net worth]], and access to other cultural resources (such as education), between racial groups.<ref name=\"Massey89\">{{cite journal |title=Hypersegregation in U.S. Metropolitan areas: Black and Hispanic Segregation Along Five Dimensions |author1=Massey, D. |author2=N.

The \"newer\" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism \u2013 which can be considered embedded in social processes and structures \u2013 are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly [[taboo]], even among those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an [[Implicit-association test|implicit]] or [[aversive racism]] is still maintained subconsciously.<ref name=\"Greenwald\" />\n\nThis process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and [[implicit attitude]]s, a component of [[implicit cognition]]. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.<ref>{{cite book|title=Implicit attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical Insights|last=Devos|first=T.|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2008|location=New York|chapter=Attitudes and attitude change |pages=61\u201384}}</ref> Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feelings, thoughts, or actions towards social objects.<ref name=\"Greenwald\">{{cite journal |last1=Greenwald |first1=A.G. |last2=Banaji |first2=M.R. |year=1995 |title=Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes |url=|journal=Psychological Review |volume=102 |issue=1|pages=4\u201327 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 |pmid=7878162|citeseerx=10.1.1.304.6161 }}</ref> These feelings, thoughts, or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Gawronski|first1=B|last2=Payne|first2=B.K.|title=Handbook of Implicit Social Cognition: Measurement, Theory and Application|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UiqBlGT7z4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=racism&f=false|isbn=978-1-60623-674-1}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors.

[[Discourse analysis]] seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study of the ways in which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. For example, Van Dijk (1992) examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analyzing Racism Through Discourse Analysis Some Methodological Reflections in Race and Ethnicity in Research Methods |publisher=Sage |author=Van Dijk, Tuen |year=1992 |location=Newbury Park, CA |pages=92\u2013134 |isbn=978-0-8039-5007-8}}</ref> He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early [[African-American literature]] that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the [[Southern United States|South]] as an African American.\n\nMuch American fictional literature has focused on issues of racism and the black \"racial experience\" in the US, including works written by whites, such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'', or even the non-fiction work ''[[Black Like Me]]''. These books, and others like them, feed into what has been called the \"[[white savior narrative in film]]\", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. [[Content analysis|Textual analysis]] of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African American writers have sometimes been portrayed in [[African-American studies]] as retreating from racial issues when they write about \"[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]\", while others identify this as an African American literary tradition called \"the literature of white estrangement\", part of a multi-pronged effort to challenge and dismantle [[white supremacy]] in the US.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whiteness |publisher=The University Press of Mississippi |author=Watson, Veronica T. |year=2013 |location=Jackson |page=137 |isbn=978-1-4968-0245-3}}</ref>\n\n===Popular usage===\nAccording to dictionaries, the word is commonly used to describe prejudice and discrimination based on race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism|title=Definition of racism in English|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism|title=Definition of racism|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nRacism can also be said to describe a condition in society in which a dominant racial group benefits from the [[oppression]] of others, whether that group wants such benefits or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 |title='Reverse Racism': 4 Myths That Need To Stop |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |author=Blay, Zeba |publisher=Huffpost Black Voices}}</ref> Foucauldian scholar Ladelle McWhorter, in her 2009 book, ''Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America: A Genealogy'', posits modern racism similarly, focusing on the notion of a dominant group, usually whites, vying for racial purity and progress, rather than an overt or obvious ideology focused on the oppression of nonwhites.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Racism and sexual oppression in Anglo-America: a genealogy |last=McWhorter |first=Ladelle |year=2009 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-35296-5 |location=Bloomington |oclc=406565635}}</ref>\n\nIn popular usage, as in some academic usage, little distinction is made between \"racism\" and \"[[ethnocentrism]]\".

To objectify a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like 'normal' society.

This new form of racism is sometimes referred to as \"modern racism\" and it is characterized by outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes, displaying subtle prejudiced behaviors such as actions informed by attributing qualities to others based on racial stereotypes, and evaluating the same behavior differently based on the race of the person being evaluated.<ref>Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., & Akert, R.M.

Another early view in scientific racism was the [[Polygenism|polygenist view]], which held that the different races had been separately created. Polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]] for example, split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the \"beautiful White race\" and the \"ugly Black race\". In Meiners' book, ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like.\n\n[[Anders Retzius]] demonstrated that neither Europeans nor others are one \"pure race\", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for the classification of the population in the United States. [[Hans Peder Steensby]], while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the \"purest race\" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=[[Danish Journal of Geography|Geografisk Tidsskrift]] |volume=19 |language=Danish |year=1907 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref>\n\nScientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and [[nation]]al [[archetype|stereotypes]] are accepted.\n\nAlthough after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], racist ideologies were discredited on ethical, political and scientific grounds, racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world. \n\n[[W.E.B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] observed that it is not so much \"race\" that we think about, but culture: \"...&nbsp;a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=Du Bois|first=W.E.B. |year=1897 |page=21 }}</ref> Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on \"race\", ethnicity, and \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.<ref>{{cite book| author = Marius Turda| title = The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880\u20131918| year = 2004| publisher = Edwin Mellen Press| isbn = 978-0-7734-6180-2 }}</ref> According to this view, [[culture]] is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination \"Germanic\" was equivalent to superiority of race.\n\nBolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: \"[r]acism does not originate from the existence of 'races'. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences.\"<ref>National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for Italy \u2013 Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216225620/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThis definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, which is still subject to scientific debate.

Many use the term \"racism\" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from scientific racism, which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and [[nationalism]] were harnessed in order to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).\n\nNotions of race and racism have often played central roles in [[ethnic conflict]]s. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as \"other\" based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when \"other\" is interpreted to mean \"inferior\"), the means employed by the self-presumed \"superior\" party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of \"the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other\".<ref>Richter, ''Facing East from Indian Country'', p.&nbsp;208</ref> [[Basil Davidson]] states in his documentary, ''Africa: Different but Equal'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.\n\nHistorically, racism was a major driving force behind the [[Transatlantic slave trade]].<ref>Fredrickson, George M. 1988.

[[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution]]aries, thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792\u20131802) and then to the conquests of [[Napoleon]], and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The [[Westphalia Treaty]] had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms (such as the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Swedish Empire]], the [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).\n\nModern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808\u20131813, known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the \"nationalities question\" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation, after [[World War I]], of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s, with \"national [[minorities]]\" in their borders.<ref>On this \"[[nationalities]] question\" and the problem of nationalism, see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789\u20131848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990\u20131992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.</ref>\n\n[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.\n\nOne of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744\u20131803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762\u20131814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798\u20131874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823\u20131892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together (\"the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]\", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806\u20131873).<ref>[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861</ref>\nEthnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with \"continental [[imperialist]]\" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951<ref name=\"Arendt\">[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)</ref>) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German ''[[Volk]]'' (people/folk). The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]] and \"[[racial hygiene]]\", and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jews]]. Another popular current, the ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse, and it combined Pan-Germanism with modern [[racial antisemitism]]. Members of the V\u00f6lkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; commonly known in English as the Nazi party). Pan-Germanism played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s\u20131930s.<ref name=Arendt />\n\nThese currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a \"[[master race]]\" (often the \"[[Aryan race]]\" or the \"[[Nordic race]]\") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called \"races\", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a \"race struggle\" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]], in order to achieve \"racial purity\" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.\n\nSuch racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nationwide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[\u00c9mile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] (1862\u20131923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.<ref>[[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], ''Le Roman de l'\u00e9nergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)</ref> At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868\u20131952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' movement, theorized the \"anti-France\", composed of the \"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners\" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|m\u00e9t\u00e8ques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all \"internal foreigners\", who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].\n\n=={{anchor|In history}}History==\n\n===Ethnocentrism and proto-racism===\n[[File:Ksenophontov noah.jpg|thumb|The [[Book of Genesis]]'s biblical curse on [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]], which was often misinterpreted as [[Curse of Ham|a curse on his father]] [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], was used to justify [[Slavery in the United States|slavery in 19th century America]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hess|first1=Richard S.|title=The Old Testament: A Historical, Theological, and Critical Introduction|date=2016|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-1-4934-0573-2|page=59|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=kfvBDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT59|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Bernard Lewis]] has cited the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] who, in his discussion of [[slavery]], stated that while [[Greeks]] are free by nature, \"[[barbarian]]s\" (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to a [[Despotism|despotic]] government.<ref name=Lewis /> Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from nations outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/raceslaveryinmid0000lewi/page/54 54\u201355]| url = https://archive.org/details/raceslaveryinmid0000lewi/page/54}}</ref> While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |title=Aristotle on Slavery |publisher=Oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906070456/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |archivedate=September 6, 2013 }}</ref> This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist [[Benjamin Isaac]].\n\nSuch proto-racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context, because a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority (with modern racism based on [[eugenics]] and scientific racism) was not yet developed and it is unclear whether Aristotle believed the natural inferiority of Barbarians was caused by environment and climate (like many of his contemporaries) or by birth.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jfylyRawl8EC&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=aristotle+racism#v=onepage&q=aristotle%20racism&f=false |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |first=Benjamin H. |last=Isaac |authorlink=Benjamin Isaac |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate=2013-11-14|isbn=978-0-691-12598-5 |year=2006 |page=175 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian Dante A.

Robert Lacey explains:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin\u2014proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy.

Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval \"historical and political discourse of race struggle\". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of \"race\", and they also transformed this popular discourse into a \"[[state racism]]\" (e.g., Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxists|Marxism]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of \"race\" into the historical notion of \"[[class struggle]]\", defined by socially structured positions: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the \"race struggle\" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concept of \"blood [[heredity]]\", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.\n\nAuthors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') which developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904\u20131907 or the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915\u20131917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem, ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899), is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.\n\n[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century illustration from ''Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View'' by H.

In the mid-20th century, the German scholar [[Carl Meinhof]] (1857\u20131944) claimed that the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] race was formed by a merger of [[Hamitic]] and [[Negroid|Negro]] races.

The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.\n\nThese racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of \"[[survival of the fittest]]\", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the \"lowest savages\" with European civilization.<ref name=\"dom\">{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1871 |publisher=John Murray|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=245 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Desmond| first = Adrian| author2 = James Richard Moore| title = Darwin| year = 1991| publisher = Michael Joseph, Penguin Group| isbn = 978-0-7181-3430-3| oclc = 185764721 }} pp. 28, 147, 580.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of \"[[degeneration]] of the race\" and \"blood [[heredity]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism, and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.\n\nBefore being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.\n\nThe neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s. According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.<ref name=\"ornl\">{{cite web | title = Minorities, Race, and Genomics| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml | accessdate = 2009-05-12}}</ref>\n\n===Heredity and eugenics===\n{{Further|Eugenics}}\nThe first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822\u20131911), who used the then-popular concept of ''[[degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged \"[[inheritance of intelligence]]\", foreshadowing future uses of \"[[intelligence testing]]\" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]] (1840\u20131902), who started publishing in 1871, a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eug\u00e8ne Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La B\u00eate humaine]]'').\n\nDuring the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.<ref>[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950</ref> According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:\n\n<blockquote>\n...up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Bene\u0161|Bene\u0161]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race&nbsp;... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as the [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the [[Porajmos|Romani Holocaust]]) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.\n\n===Polygenism and racial typologies===\n{{Further|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)}}\n[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|right|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the \"present distribution of European races\", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow.]]\nWorks such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853\u20131855) may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]].\n\nGobineau's theories would be expanded in France by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854\u20131936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white \"[[Aryan]] race\" \"[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]\", was opposed to the \"brachycephalic\" race, of whom the \"[[Jew]]\" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races, in which he identified the \"''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the \"''[[Homo alpinus]]''\" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the \"''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''\" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's \"selectionism\" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a \"degenerate\"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His \"anthroposociology\" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order.<ref>Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan).

They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about \"which side\" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.\n\nTheir colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[Memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes mis-attributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the \"correct\" speaker, although they also sometimes mis-attributed a statement to a speaker \"on the same side\" as the \"correct\" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the \"sides\" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.<ref name=\"KurzbanToobyCosmides2001ErasingRace\">{{cite journal |title=Can race be erased?

Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors. They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew, until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.<ref>New Scientist.

The Nuremberg Laws stripped all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews (second and first degree ''Mischlings''), of their German citizenship. This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., the [[the right to vote|right to vote]]. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from having any influence in education, politics, higher education, and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] \u2013 [[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].\n\n[[File:The Chinese Must Go - Magic Washer - 1886 anti-Chinese US cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|19th century [[political cartoon]]: ''[[Uncle Sam]] kicks out the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]'', referring to the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].]]\n\nLegislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of [[South Africa]] during its [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here, a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa|Apartheid legislation]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, from using certain public transportation, and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently than white South Africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as \"dom passes\", to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal [[human rights]] laws which were passed at the end of the [[Apartheid]] era in the early 1990s.\n\n==Anti-racism==\n{{Main|Anti-racism}}\n[[File:Anti-racist-rally-Sydney-2005-Dec-18-small.jpeg|thumb|An anti-racism rally held outside [[Sydney Town Hall]], December 2005.]]\n\nAnti-racism includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies which are adopted or developed in order to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against on the basis of race. Movements such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were examples of anti-racist movements. [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes embraced as an element of anti-racist movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy which is intended to suppress racism.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Afrophobia]]\n* [[Allport's Scale]]\n* [[Anti-racism]]\n* [[Aporophobia]]\n* [[Christian Identity]]\n* [[Creativity (religion)]]\n* [[Curse and mark of Cain]]\n* [[Curse of Ham]]\n* [[Discrimination based on skin color]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Environmental racism in Europe]]\n* [[Ethnic conflict]]\n* [[Ethnic hatred]]\n* [[Ethnocentrism]]\n* [[Holocaust]]\n* [[Identitarianism]]\n* [[Index of racism-related articles]]\n* [[In-group favoritism]]\n* [[Kung-flu]]\n* [[Labeling theory]]\n* [[Nigger]]\n* [[Negro]]\n* [[Objectification|Objectification of people]]\n* [[Racial bias in criminal news]]\n* [[Racial discrimination]]\n* [[Racial fetishism]]\n* [[Racialism]]\n* [[Racial literacy]]\n* [[Racial segregation]]\n* [[Racialization]]\n* [[Raciolinguistics]]\n* [[Pre-Adamite#Racist pre-Adamism|Racist pre-Adamism]]\n* [[Racism in horror films]]\n* [[Racism in the LGBT community]]\n* [[Reverse discrimination]]\n* [[Reverse racism]]\n* [[Romantic racism]]\n* [[Scientific racism]]\n* [[Structural racism]]\n* [[Social interpretations of race]]\n* [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations]]\n* [[Stereotype threat]]\n* [[Tatarophobia]]\n* [[Tragic mulatto]]\n* [[Tribalism]]\n* [[Yellow Peril]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Allen, Theodore.
