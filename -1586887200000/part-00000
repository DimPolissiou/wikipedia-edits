It had its origins in a [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer]] unit of the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) formed in the 1890s. It provided the divisional signals for the [[44th (Home Counties) Division]] and its duplicates in both World Wars, also seeing active service with [[28th Division (United Kingdom)|28th Division]] in World War I. Its successor continued in the postwar TA and [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]].\n\n==Origin==\n{{main|1st Sussex Engineers}}\nWhen the [[Volunteer Force]] was subsumed into the new [[Territorial Force]] (TF) under the [[Haldane Reforms]] in 1908, the former [[1st Sussex Engineers|1st Sussex Engineer Volunteer Corps]] provided the divisional engineers for the TF's [[44th (Home Counties) Division|Home Counties Division]], including the Home Counties Divisional Telegraph Company with the following organisation:<ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 13.</ref><ref name = Lord>Lord & Watson, pp. 152\u20134.</ref><ref>Morling, pp. 19 & 249.</ref><ref name = Nalder>Nalder, p. 598.</ref><ref name = MAL>''Monthly Army List'', various dates.</ref><ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28121/supplement/2155 ''London Gazette', 20 March 1908.]</ref>\n* Company Headquarters at 23 Gloucester Place, [[Brighton]]\n* No 1 Section at Brighton\n* No 2 (Surrey) Section\n* No 3 (Kent) Section\n* No 4 (Middlesex) Section\nNos 2\u20134 Sections were attached to and largely manned by the three infantry brigades of the division. The Telegraph Company was redesignated a Signal Company in 1911.<ref name = MAL/><ref name = Lord/>\n\n==World War I==\n===Mobilisation===\nThe Signal Company had been with the Home Counties Division on [[Salisbury Plain]] for its annual training when the order came to mobilise on 4 August 1914. The unit returned to Brighton and was embodied the following day. Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for overseas service. Early in September battalions of the Home Counties Division began to relieve Regular units at [[Gibraltar]], then in October the infantry and artillery of the whole division embarked for garrison service in [[British Raj|India]]. Although it did later receive a number (44th), the Home Counties Division never operated as a formation during the war: its units remained scattered in colonial garrisons or were attached to Indian divisions. The Divisional RE remained in England to support Regular formations: the Signal Company joined the [[28th Division (United Kingdom)|28th Division]], which was forming at [[Winchester]] primarily from units returned from service in India.<ref name = Becke44>Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49\u201354.</ref><ref name = Trail44>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/44th-home-counties-division/ 44 Division at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = Morling35>Morling, p. 35.</ref>\n\nOn 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later 3rd Line units were formed to supply drafts to the 1st and 2nd Lines.<ref>Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.</ref>\n[[File:28th Division sign WW1.svg|thumb|150px|Formation sign of the 28th Division, a strip of red cloth on the shoulder strap.]]\n\n===1st Home Counties Signal Company===\n1st Home Counties Signal Company joined 28th Division at Winchester on 5 January 1915 and provided its communications until beyond the end of the war.<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Becke44/><ref name = Trail44/><ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28>Becke, Pt 1, pp. 106\u201316.</ref><ref>Lord & Watson, p. 222.</ref> The division embarked at [[Southampton]] 15\u201318 January, disembarking at [[Le Havre]] 16\u201319 January, and concentrated between [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]] and [[Hazebrouck]] by 22 January. While on the Western Front it participated in the following actions:<ref name = Becke28/>\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22\u201323 April 1915)|Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge]] (22\u201323 April)\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of St. Julien (24 April \u2013 5 May)|Battle of St Julien]] (24 April\u20134 May)\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Frezenberg (8\u201313 May)|Battle of Frezenberg Ridge]] (8\u201313 May)\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Bellewaarde (24\u201325 May)|Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge]] (24\u201325 May)\n* [[Battle of Loos]] (27 September\u20135 October)\n\nAt noon on 19 October 1915 the division was ordered to leave for an unknown destination within 48 hours. The Signals Company entrained on 20 October, embarked at [[Marseille]] on 24 October and arrived at [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt#British protectorate .281882.E2.80.931952.29|Egypt]] on 29 October. The division then embarked again for the [[Macedonian front]], the Signal Company arriving at [[Salonika]] on 16 December 1915, joining the division on the [[Struma (river)|River Struma]].<ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28/>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q1396.jpg|thumb|left|An RE Signal Company at work on the Western Front.]]\n28th Division spent the rest of the war on this front, where there were few major actions, but the troops suffered steady attrition through trench warfare casualties and sickness. A year after its arrival it took part in the occupation of Mazirko and the capture of Bairakli Jum'a. In May 1917 it captured Ferdie and Essex Trenches near Bairakli Jum'a, and in October it captured Nairakli and Kumli. Finally, on 18 and 19 September 1918, 28th Division took part in the [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|Battle of Doiran]] and the subsequent pursuit of the defeated Bulgarian Army up the [[Strumica]] Valley. On 29 September Bulgaria concluded the [[Armistice of Salonica]] with the Allies. This was followed a month later by the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with the Turks. Early in November the 28th Division was sent to occupy [[Constantinople]] and the [[Dardanelles]] Forts, with Divisional HQ at Chanak ([[\u00c7anakkale]]).<ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28/>\n\n28th Division remained in these positions, though its units (including 28th Divisional Signal Company of the new [[Royal Corps of Signals]]) were progressively manned by Regulars after the remaining TF men were demobilised. In July 1922, 28th Division was moved to interpose between the Greek and Turkish armies (the [[Chanak Crisis]]). After a ceasefire was arranged, the British troops were progressively reduced. On 2 October 1923 the final evacuation took place, and 28th Division was disbanded.<ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28/>\n\n===2nd Home Counties Signal Company===\n2nd Home Counties Signal Co was formed at Brighton and the 2nd Home Counties Division began to assemble around [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in November 1914. There was a shortage of equipment with which to train \u2013 only a few old [[6.5\u00d750mmSR Arisaka|.256-in Japanese Ariska rifles]] were available. In July 1915 the units had to be reorganised as TF men who had only signed up for Home Service were transferred to Home Defence brigades (termed Provisional Brigades). A few Home Counties men probably joined [[9th Provisional Signal Section, Royal Engineers|9th Provisional Signal Section]] in [[9th Provisional Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Provisional Brigade]], formed in [[Kent]] predominantly from East Lancashire units. The 2nd HC Division was redesignated [[67th (2nd Home Counties) Division]] in August 1915 and the signal company became 67th (2nd HC) Signal Co. In November the division became part of [[Second Army (Home Forces)|Second Army]], [[Central Force]], and was quartered in Kent, the Signal Co HQ located with divisional HQ (DHQ) at [[Canterbury]]. On 19 January 1916 the sections left to join their respective brigades.<ref name = Becke67>Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75\u201382.</ref><ref name = Morling67>Morling, pp. 36\u20137.</ref>\n\n67th (2nd HC) Division had the dual role of home defence and supplying drafts to units serving overseas. It was twice warned for service in [[Ireland]] and in April 1917 for service on the Western Front, but these deployments never materialised and the division spent the whole war in England. During the winter of 1917\u201318 the division moved to [[Essex]], where it joined [[XXIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XXIII Corps]]. DHQ and Signals were at [[Colchester]]. The units maintained these dispositions until after the [[Armistice with Germany]], when demobilisation began. In March 1919 the remaining RE units began to disband, and the process was soon completed.<ref name = Becke67/><ref name = Morling67/>\n\n==Royal Signals==\nWhen the TF was reconstituted as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920\u20131, a new '''44th (Home Counties) Divisional Signals'''{{efn|Divisional signal units of the Royal Signals 1920\u201345 were battalion-sized and commanded by a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]]; they were not termed 'regiments' until 1946.<ref>Lord & Watson, p. 21.</ref>}} was formed by the newly-formed [[Royal Corps of Signals]] (RCS). It combined the former 44th (HC) Signal Company, RE, with [[10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment]]. Headquarters was at Stamford Brook Lodge, [[Ravenscourt Park (ward)|Ravenscourt Park]], West London (the former HQ of the 10th Middlesex), with 2 Company at Brighton and sections at [[New Southgate]], [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] and [[Hurstpierpoint]].<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-so/mx-10.htm |title=10th Middlesex at Regiments.org. |access-date=2005-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227043705/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-so/mx-10.htm |archive-date=2005-12-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{efn|In the 1920s the Royal Signals' journal, ''The Wire'', was published from Stamford Brook Lodge.<ref name = MAL/><ref>[https://www.royalsignalsmuseum.co.uk/wire-archive/ ''The Wire'' archive at Royal Signals Museum.]</ref>}}\n\nBy the 1930s, 44th (HC) Signals also administered:<ref name = MAL/>\n* 226th Field Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, Gloucester Road, Brighton\n* 227th Field Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, Hurstpierpoint, later at Drill Hall, [[Bognor Regis]]\n* 203rd Medium Artillery Signal Section, [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], Chatham\n\nThe 4th Cadet Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment was also attached to the unit.<ref name = MAL/>\n\n==World War II==\n===Mobilisation===\nFollowing the [[Munich Crisis]] the TA was doubled in size.

Next day the BEF fell back to the 'Canal Line', and 44th (HC) Division was withdrawn into reserve.<ref name = EllisV>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-5.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter V.]</ref><ref name = EllisVI>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-6.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter VI.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-7.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter VII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-8.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter VIII.]</ref>\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_France_1940_F3159.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Signals erecting cable poles in France, 1940.]] \nCut off, the BEF fell back towards the coast, with 44th (HC) Division given the responsibility of defending the area round [[Hazebrouck]]. On 26 May the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through [[Dunkirk]] ([[Operation Dynamo]]). 44th (HC) Division was heavily attacked by German [[Panzer]] divisions on 27 May, but fought on doggedly until ordered to withdraw, by which time the enemy's advanced columns had penetrated between its widely-spread units. With its flanks 'in the air' after neighbouring French formations retreated during the night of 28/29 May, the divisional commander decided to withdraw some {{convert|6|mi|km}} to [[Mont des Cats]], a strong position held by the divisional artillery and some of the divisional RE acting as infantry, though only DHQ and scattered elements reached the Mont by dawn to join them. This rearguard was subjected to intense mortar fire next morning, then by dive-bombing, but held its position for 30 hours while the rest of the division withdrew. The remnants of the division reached the beaches for embarkation, reaching England on 1 June.<ref name = Joslen44/><ref name = EllisIX>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-9.htm Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter IX.]</ref><ref name = EllisXI>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-11.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XI.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-12.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XII.]</ref><ref name = EllisXIII>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-13.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XIII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-14.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XIV.]</ref>\n\n====Home Defence====\nOn return to England, 44th (HC) Division was briefly in [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]], then until October in North East England with [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] before returning to invasion-threatened South East England with [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]]. In April 1942 the division came under [[War Office]] control preparatory to going overseas, and on 29 May it embarked for Egypt.<ref name = Joslen44/>\n\n====North Africa====\n44th (HC) Division arrived in Egypt on 24 July, shortly after [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] had retreated to the [[El Alamein]] position. On 15 August it was assigned to [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] before General [[Rommel]] attacked the El Alamein line (the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]]). The division held the Alam Halfa ridge  when the attack came in on 30 August. Over the next two days the Panzers made repeated attacks but 44th (HC) Division held its position and by 3 September the division was counter-attacking.<ref name = Joslen44/><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384\u201390.</ref>\n\nFor Eighth Army's counter-offensive (the [[Second Battle of Alamein]]), 44th (HC) Division was to lead one of XIII Corps' thrusts through the enemy minefields on the first night, 23/24 October ([[Operation Lightfoot]]). A route was found through the first belt of minefields ('January') on the first night and 44th (HC) Division succeeded in passing the second minefield ('February') the next night, but the armour was unable to exploit beyond.<ref>Joslen, p. 570.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 42\u20133, 46\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe second phase of the offensive, [[Operation Supercharge (1942)|Operation Supercharge]], was launched on the night of 27/28 October. Eventually, the armour broke though, and next day came signs that the enemy was withdrawing. 44th (HC) Division took some part in the pursuit to [[El Agheila]], collecting prisoners, but XIII Corps was short of transport and was left behind as Eighth Army drove westwards. Shortly afterwards 44th (HC) Division HQ was disbanded, and its units distributed.<ref name = Joslen44/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 92\u20133; 220.</ref> The personnel of 44th (HC) Divisional Signals were used to reinforce [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps Signals]], [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division Signals]] and No 4 Line of Communication (LoC) Signals.<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/>\n[[File:12th British Infantry Division WW2.svg|thumb|150px|right|12th (Eastern) Divisional sign.]]\n\n===12th (Eastern) Divisional Signals===\nIn April 1940 three of the new duplicate TA divisions under training, including 12th (E) Division, were sent to France to act as labour troops to work on airfields and LoCs.

The following day the division was covering the important traffic centres of Albert, Doullens, Amiens and Abbeville together with two equally ill-equipped brigades of [[23rd (Northumbrian) Division]], all under the commander of 12th (E) Division, Maj-Gen R.L Petre and known as 'Petreforce'.

Its casualties were so severe that it was broken up on 10 July, with the divisional signals sending reinforcements to 44th (HC) Signals and 1 Army Signal Training Regiment in the UK and to the Middle East, including No 3 LoC Signals and Sudan Signals.<ref name = Joslen12/><ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/>\n\n==Postwar==\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the unit reformed at [[Gillingham, Kent]], as '''44 (Home Counties) Divisional Signal Regiment''' with the following organisation:<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/>\n* Regimental HQ at Stamford Brook\n* 1 Squadron at Stamford Brook\n* 2 Squadron at Brighton\n* 3 Squadron at Chatham\n\nIn 1957, 2 Sqn moved to [[Bromley]], but E, F and G [[Troop]]s remained at Brighton and a new K troop was formed at [[Richmond, London|Richmond-upon-Thames]].<ref name = Lord/>\n\nWhen the TA was reorganised in 1961, the division became 44th (Home Counties) Division/District and the regiment absorbed the district signal unit, [[London District Signals#Postwar|62 (Mixed) Signal Regiment (Cinque Ports)]]. This had been formed in [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] in 1947 as 11th AA (Mixed) Signal Rgt from elements of the wartime 1 and 2 AA Group Signals. The subtitle 'Mixed' indicated that members of the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]] were integrated into the unit. After AA Command was disbanded in 1955 the regiment merged with [[259th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|259 (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports)]]. Based at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp|Shorncliffe]], the unit was numbered as 62 Signal Rgt in 1959 and adopted the '[[Cinque Ports]]' subtitle the following year.

In March 1969 it formed 858 (Corps) Trp at [[Eastbourne]] and 859 Trp at [[Ilford]], which moved to Eastbourne in 1970. The role of these Trps was to reinforce the Regular 22 Signal Rgt in [[British Army of the Rhine]].

It had its origins in a [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer]] unit of the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) formed in the 1890s. It provided the divisional signals for the [[44th (Home Counties) Division]] and its duplicates in both World Wars, also seeing active service with [[28th Division (United Kingdom)|28th Division]] in World War I. Its successor continued in the postwar TA and [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]].\n\n==Origin==\n{{main|1st Sussex Engineers}}\nWhen the [[Volunteer Force]] was subsumed into the new [[Territorial Force]] (TF) under the [[Haldane Reforms]] in 1908, the former [[1st Sussex Engineers|1st Sussex Engineer Volunteer Corps]] provided the divisional engineers for the TF's [[44th (Home Counties) Division|Home Counties Division]], including the Home Counties Divisional Telegraph Company with the following organisation:<ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 13.</ref><ref name = Lord>Lord & Watson, pp. 152\u20134.</ref><ref>Morling, pp. 19 & 249.</ref><ref name = Nalder>Nalder, p. 598.</ref><ref name = MAL>''Monthly Army List'', various dates.</ref><ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28121/supplement/2155 ''London Gazette', 20 March 1908.]</ref>\n* Company Headquarters at 23 Gloucester Place, [[Brighton]]\n* No 1 Section at Brighton\n* No 2 (Surrey) Section\n* No 3 (Kent) Section\n* No 4 (Middlesex) Section\nNos 2\u20134 Sections were attached to and largely manned by the three infantry brigades of the division. The Telegraph Company was redesignated a Signal Company in 1911.<ref name = MAL/><ref name = Lord/>\n\n==World War I==\n===Mobilisation===\nThe Signal Company had been with the Home Counties Division on [[Salisbury Plain]] for its annual training when the order came to mobilise on 4 August 1914. The unit returned to Brighton and was embodied the following day. Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for overseas service. Early in September battalions of the Home Counties Division began to relieve Regular units at [[Gibraltar]], then in October the infantry and artillery of the whole division embarked for garrison service in [[British Raj|India]]. Although it did later receive a number (44th), the Home Counties Division never operated as a formation during the war: its units remained scattered in colonial garrisons or were attached to Indian divisions. The Divisional RE remained in England to support Regular formations: the Signal Company joined the [[28th Division (United Kingdom)|28th Division]], which was forming at [[Winchester]] primarily from units returned from service in India.<ref name = Becke44>Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49\u201354.</ref><ref name = Trail44>[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/44th-home-counties-division/ 44 Division at Long, Long Trail.]</ref><ref name = Morling35>Morling, p. 35.</ref>\n\nOn 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later 3rd Line units were formed to supply drafts to the 1st and 2nd Lines.<ref>Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.</ref>\n[[File:28th Division sign WW1.svg|thumb|150px|Formation sign of the 28th Division, a strip of red cloth on the shoulder strap.]]\n\n===1st Home Counties Signal Company===\n1st Home Counties Signal Company joined 28th Division at Winchester on 5 January 1915 and provided its communications until beyond the end of the war.<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Becke44/><ref name = Trail44/><ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28>Becke, Pt 1, pp. 106\u201316.</ref><ref>Lord & Watson, p. 222.</ref> The division embarked at [[Southampton]] 15\u201318 January, disembarking at [[Le Havre]] 16\u201319 January, and concentrated between [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]] and [[Hazebrouck]] by 22 January. While on the Western Front it participated in the following actions:<ref name = Becke28/>\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22\u201323 April 1915)|Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge]] (22\u201323 April)\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of St. Julien (24 April \u2013 5 May)|Battle of St Julien]] (24 April\u20134 May)\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Frezenberg (8\u201313 May)|Battle of Frezenberg Ridge]] (8\u201313 May)\n* [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of Bellewaarde (24\u201325 May)|Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge]] (24\u201325 May)\n* [[Battle of Loos]] (27 September\u20135 October)\n\nAt noon on 19 October 1915 the division was ordered to leave for an unknown destination within 48 hours. The Signals Company entrained on 20 October, embarked at [[Marseille]] on 24 October and arrived at [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt#British protectorate .281882.E2.80.931952.29|Egypt]] on 29 October. The division then embarked again for the [[Macedonian front]], the Signal Company arriving at [[Salonika]] on 16 December 1915, joining the division on the [[Struma (river)|River Struma]].<ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28/>\n[[File:The_Battle_of_the_Somme,_July-november_1916_Q1396.jpg|thumb|left|An RE Signal Company at work on the Western Front.]]\n28th Division spent the rest of the war on this front, where there were few major actions, but the troops suffered steady attrition through trench warfare casualties and sickness. A year after its arrival it took part in the occupation of Mazirko and the capture of Bairakli Jum'a. In May 1917 it captured Ferdie and Essex Trenches near Bairakli Jum'a, and in October it captured Nairakli and Kumli. Finally, on 18 and 19 September 1918, 28th Division took part in the [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|Battle of Doiran]] and the subsequent pursuit of the defeated Bulgarian Army up the [[Strumica]] Valley. On 29 September Bulgaria concluded the [[Armistice of Salonica]] with the Allies. This was followed a month later by the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with the Turks. Early in November the 28th Division was sent to occupy [[Constantinople]] and the [[Dardanelles]] Forts, with Divisional HQ at Chanak ([[\u00c7anakkale]]).<ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28/>\n\n28th Division remained in these positions, though its units (including 28th Divisional Signal Company of the new [[Royal Corps of Signals]]) were progressively manned by Regulars after the remaining TF men were demobilised. In July 1922, 28th Division was moved to interpose between the Greek and Turkish armies (the [[Chanak Crisis]]). After a ceasefire was arranged, the British troops were progressively reduced. On 2 October 1923 the final evacuation took place, and 28th Division was disbanded.<ref name = Morling35/><ref name = Becke28/>\n\n===2nd Home Counties Signal Company===\n2nd Home Counties Signal Co was formed at Brighton and the 2nd Home Counties Division began to assemble around [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in November 1914. There was a shortage of equipment with which to train \u2013 only a few old [[6.5\u00d750mmSR Arisaka|.256-in Japanese Ariska rifles]] were available. In July 1915 the units had to be reorganised as TF men who had only signed up for Home Service were transferred to Home Defence brigades (termed Provisional Brigades). A few Home Counties men probably joined [[9th Provisional Signal Section, Royal Engineers|9th Provisional Signal Section]] in [[9th Provisional Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Provisional Brigade]], formed in [[Kent]] predominantly from East Lancashire units. The 2nd HC Division was redesignated [[67th (2nd Home Counties) Division]] in August 1915 and the signal company became 67th (2nd HC) Signal Co. In November the division became part of [[Second Army (Home Forces)|Second Army]], [[Central Force]], and was quartered in Kent, the Signal Co HQ located with divisional HQ (DHQ) at [[Canterbury]]. On 19 January 1916 the sections left to join their respective brigades.<ref name = Becke67>Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75\u201382.</ref><ref name = Morling67>Morling, pp. 36\u20137.</ref>\n\n67th (2nd HC) Division had the dual role of home defence and supplying drafts to units serving overseas. It was twice warned for service in [[Ireland]] and in April 1917 for service on the Western Front, but these deployments never materialised and the division spent the whole war in England. During the winter of 1917\u201318 the division moved to [[Essex]], where it joined [[XXIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XXIII Corps]]. DHQ and Signals were at [[Colchester]]. The units maintained these dispositions until after the [[Armistice with Germany]], when demobilisation began. In March 1919 the remaining RE units began to disband, and the process was soon completed.<ref name = Becke67/><ref name = Morling67/>\n\n==Royal Signals==\nWhen the TF was reconstituted as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920\u20131, a new '''44th (Home Counties) Divisional Signals'''{{efn|Divisional signal units of the Royal Signals 1920\u201345 were battalion-sized and commanded by a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]]; they were not termed 'regiments' until 1946.<ref>Lord & Watson, p. 21.</ref>}} was formed by the newly-formed [[Royal Corps of Signals]] (RCS). It combined the former 44th (HC) Signal Company, RE, with [[10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment]]. Headquarters was at Stamford Brook Lodge, [[Ravenscourt Park (ward)|Ravenscourt Park]], West London (the former HQ of the 10th Middlesex), with 2 Company at Brighton and sections at [[New Southgate]], [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] and [[Hurstpierpoint]].<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-so/mx-10.htm |title=10th Middlesex at Regiments.org. |access-date=2005-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227043705/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-so/mx-10.htm |archive-date=2005-12-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{efn|In the 1920s the Royal Signals' journal, ''The Wire'', was published from Stamford Brook Lodge.<ref name = MAL/><ref>[https://www.royalsignalsmuseum.co.uk/wire-archive/ ''The Wire'' archive at Royal Signals Museum.]</ref>}}\n\nBy the 1930s, 44th (HC) Signals also administered:<ref name = MAL/>\n* 226th Field Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, Gloucester Road, Brighton\n* 227th Field Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, Hurstpierpoint, later at Drill Hall, [[Bognor Regis]]\n* 203rd Medium Artillery Signal Section, [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], Chatham\n\nThe 4th Cadet Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment was also attached to the unit.<ref name = MAL/>\n\n==World War II==\n===Mobilisation===\nFollowing the [[Munich Crisis]] the TA was doubled in size.

Next day the BEF fell back to the 'Canal Line', and 44th (HC) Division was withdrawn into reserve.<ref name = EllisV>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-5.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter V.]</ref><ref name = EllisVI>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-6.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter VI.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-7.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter VII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-8.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter VIII.]</ref>\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_France_1940_F3159.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Signals erecting cable poles in France, 1940.]] \nCut off, the BEF fell back towards the coast, with 44th (HC) Division given the responsibility of defending the area round [[Hazebrouck]]. On 26 May the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through [[Dunkirk]] ([[Operation Dynamo]]). 44th (HC) Division was heavily attacked by German [[Panzer]] divisions on 27 May, but fought on doggedly until ordered to withdraw, by which time the enemy's advanced columns had penetrated between its widely-spread units. With its flanks 'in the air' after neighbouring French formations retreated during the night of 28/29 May, the divisional commander decided to withdraw some {{convert|6|mi|km}} to [[Mont des Cats]], a strong position held by the divisional artillery and some of the divisional RE acting as infantry, though only DHQ and scattered elements reached the Mont by dawn to join them. This rearguard was subjected to intense mortar fire next morning, then by dive-bombing, but held its position for 30 hours while the rest of the division withdrew. The remnants of the division reached the beaches for embarkation, reaching England on 1 June.<ref name = Joslen44/><ref name = EllisIX>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-9.htm Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter IX.]</ref><ref name = EllisXI>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-11.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XI.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-12.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XII.]</ref><ref name = EllisXIII>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-13.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XIII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-14.html Ellis, ''France & Flanders'', Chapter XIV.]</ref>\n\n====Home Defence====\nOn return to England, 44th (HC) Division was briefly in [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]], then until October in North East England with [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] before returning to invasion-threatened South East England with [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]].

On 15 August it was assigned to [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] before General [[Rommel]] attacked the El Alamein line (the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]]). The division held the Alam Halfa ridge  when the attack came in on 30 August. Over the next two days the Panzers made repeated attacks but 44th (HC) Division held its position and by 3 September the division was counter-attacking.<ref name = Joslen44/><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384\u201390.</ref>\n\nFor Eighth Army's counter-offensive (the [[Second Battle of Alamein]]), 44th (HC) Division was to lead one of XIII Corps' thrusts through the enemy minefields on the first night, 23/24 October ([[Operation Lightfoot]]). A route was found through the first belt of minefields ('January') on the first night and 44th (HC) Division succeeded in passing the second minefield ('February') the next night, but the armour was unable to exploit beyond.<ref>Joslen, p. 570.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 42\u20133, 46\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe second phase of the offensive, [[Operation Supercharge (1942)|Operation Supercharge]], was launched on the night of 27/28 October. Eventually, the armour broke though, and next day came signs that the enemy was withdrawing. 44th (HC) Division took some part in the pursuit to [[El Agheila]], collecting prisoners, but XIII Corps was short of transport and was left behind as Eighth Army drove westwards. Shortly afterwards 44th (HC) Division HQ was disbanded, and its units distributed.<ref name = Joslen44/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 92\u20133; 220.</ref> The personnel of 44th (HC) Divisional Signals were used to reinforce [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps Signals]], [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division Signals]] and No 4 Line of Communication (LoC) Signals.<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/>\n[[File:12th British Infantry Division WW2.svg|thumb|150px|right|12th (Eastern) Divisional sign.]]\n\n===12th (Eastern) Divisional Signals===\nIn April 1940 three of the new duplicate TA divisions under training, including 12th (E) Division, were sent to France to act as labour troops to work on airfields and LoCs.

The following day the division was covering the important traffic centres of Albert, Doullens, Amiens and Abbeville together with two equally ill-equipped brigades of [[23rd (Northumbrian) Division]], all under the commander of 12th (E) Division, Maj-Gen R.L Petre and known as 'Petreforce'.

Its casualties were so severe that it was broken up on 10 July, with the divisional signals sending reinforcements to 44th (HC) Signals and 1 Army Signal Training Regiment in the UK and to the Middle East, including No 3 LoC Signals and Sudan Signals.<ref name = Joslen12/><ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/>\n\n==Postwar==\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the unit reformed at [[Gillingham, Kent]], as '''44 (Home Counties) Divisional Signal Regiment''' with the following organisation:<ref name = Lord/><ref name = Nalder/>\n* Regimental HQ at Stamford Brook\n* 1 Squadron at Stamford Brook\n* 2 Squadron at Brighton\n* 3 Squadron at Chatham\n\nIn 1957, 2 Sqn moved to [[Bromley]], but E, F and G [[Troop]]s remained at Brighton and a new K troop was formed at [[Richmond, London|Richmond-upon-Thames]].<ref name = Lord/>\n\nWhen the TA was reorganised in 1961, the division became 44th (Home Counties) Division/District and the regiment absorbed the district signal unit, [[London District Signals#Postwar|62 (Mixed) Signal Regiment (Cinque Ports)]]. This had been formed in [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] in 1947 as 11th AA (Mixed) Signal Rgt from elements of the wartime 1 and 2 AA Group Signals. The subtitle 'Mixed' indicated that members of the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]] were integrated into the unit. After AA Command was disbanded in 1955 the regiment merged with [[259th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|259 (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports)]]. Based at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp|Shorncliffe]], the unit was numbered as 62 Signal Rgt in 1959 and adopted the '[[Cinque Ports]]' subtitle the following year. The merged regiment also took this historic title, as '''44 (Home Counties) Signal Regiment (Cinque Ports)'''<ref name = Lord/><ref>Nalder, pp. 617\u20138.</ref> The merged regiment also took on administrative responsibility for two brigade signal sqns in 44 (HC) Division:<ref name = Lord/><ref>Lord & Watson, p. 205.</ref>\n* 329 Sqn formed in 1959 at Bromley from [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131 (Surrey) Infantry Bde]] Signals\n* 330 Sqn formed in 1959 at [[Tunbridge Wells]] from [[133rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|133 (Kent & Sussex) Infantry Bde]] Signals\n\nWhen the TA was reduced into the [[Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve]] (TAVR) in 1967 the regiment became a single squadron ('''44 (Cinque Ports) Sqn''') at Gillingham in [[36 (Eastern) Signal Regiment]]. In March 1969 it formed 858 (Corps) Trp at [[Eastbourne]] and 859 Trp at [[Ilford]], which moved to Eastbourne in 1970. The role of these Trps was to reinforce the Regular 22 Signal Rgt in [[British Army of the Rhine]]. These two Trps combined on 30 November 1977 to reform the disbanded [[City_of_London_Signals#Postwar|56 Signal Sqn]].<ref name = Lord/><ref>Lord & Watson, pp 168\u201370.</ref><ref name = 36Regts>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/sig36.htm |title=36 Signal Rgt at Regiments.org. |access-date=2006-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104211310/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/sig36.htm |archive-date=2006-01-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 44 Sqn's HQ moved to [[Grays, Essex]], and a sub-unit was formed at [[Prittlewell]], [[Southend-on-Sea]], from a troop from [[Essex Yeomanry#Postwar|70 (Essex Yeomanry) Signal Sqn]], a platoon of [[10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment]], and part of 215 Transport Sqn, [[Royal Corps of Transport]], giving the following organisation:<ref name = Lord/><ref name = 36Regts/>\n* SHQ at Grays\n* 747 and 748 Trps at Grays\n* 746 and 749 Trps at Prittlewell\n\nUnder the Strategic Review of Reserves in 2009, 36 (Eastern) Signal Rgt was reduced to [[Essex Yeomanry#Postwar|36 (Essex Yeomanry) Signal Sqn]] at Colchester, including '''844 (Cinque Ports) Signal Troop'''.\n\n==Commanding Officers==\nUnit commanders included the following:<ref name = MAL/><ref name = Nalder/>\n\nHome Counties Divisional Signal Co, RE:\n* Capt H.C.

FAS.org, 14 April 2000.</ref> Conceived for modern [[Armoured warfare|armored ground warfare]] and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 [[short ton]]s (almost 62 [[metric ton]]s), it introduced several innovative features, including a [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine|turbine engine]], sophisticated [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] [[composite armor]], a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun, while later variants feature a licensed [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44]].\n\nThe M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the [[MBT-70]] project to replace the obsolescent [[M60 Patton]]. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009.<ref name=\"Armylooking2009\" />{{update after|2019|6|17}} Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D (formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively) versions such as improved [[composite armor]], better optics, digital systems and ammunition.<ref>{{citation |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Inside the US Army's Lethal New M1A2 SEP v.3 Abrams Main Battle Tank |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190927/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Abrams was due to be replaced by the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Future Combat Systems XM1202]] but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\n\nThe M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The export version is used by the armies of [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]], [[Kuwaiti Army|Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabian Army|Saudi Arabia]], [[Australian Army|Australia]], and [[Iraqi Army|Iraq]]. The Abrams was first used in combat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and has seen combat in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in [[International military intervention against ISIL|the war against ISIL]] and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the M1 Abrams}}\n\n===Previous developments===\n{{main|MBT-70}}\n\nThrough the 1960s the US Army and German Army had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the [[M60 Patton]] and the [[Leopard 1]]. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the [[T-62]], while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] gun and especially [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |title=Licht vom Mond |accessdate=2010-11-08 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112816/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} \n\nThe resulting design, the [[MBT-70]], incorporated new technologies across the board. A [[hydropneumatic suspension]] provided excellent cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver, with the lowest position placing the top of the tank only {{convert|6|feet}} off the ground. New 1,500&nbsp;hp-class engines powered the designs which could both reach {{convert|43|mph}}, 50% faster than the T-62. Finally, two new guns were introduced, a US 152&nbsp;mm design whose primary long-range weapon was the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missile]], while the Germans introduced a new [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|120 mm smoothbore]] design.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/>\n\nWhile the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget.

This succeeded only in producing an expensive system with capabilities similar to the M60.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title=MBT-70 / XM803 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823045247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010 }}</ref> Congress canceled the MBT-70 in November and XM803 December 1971, and redistributed the funds to the XM1 Abrams named after General [[Creighton Abrams]].\n\nThe [[Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] (TACOM) began examining specific goals. After several rounds of input, the decision was made to offer maximum armor to defeat the \"heavy threat\". Heavy in this context considered the 115&nbsp;mm gun of the T-62 using projected improvements of their [[APFSDS]] ammunition through the 1980s, or the new 125&nbsp;mm gun of the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]] firing [[high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nTo this end, a new design basis emerged in February 1973, LK 10372. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 meters and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the [[Royal Ordnance L7]], along with a coaxial 20&nbsp;mm version of the [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nExamining the experiences of the [[Yom Kippur War]] that year, a number of design changes were made. The newly-created [[Chobham armour|\"Burlington\" armor]] from the [[British Army]]'s labs was incorporated to improve protection, especially against HEAT, and to incorporate the new armor package, the original goal of keeping weight under {{convert|50|ST}} was abandoned. The Bushmaster was seen as superfluous and was replaced with a [[M240 machine gun]], the US version of the [[FN MAG]]. As TACOM continued to improve the detailed design, initial samples of the armor system were sent to the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] for testing.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nAt the time, the US military's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best possible design. This often resulted in the programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars ({{inflation|US|507000|1972|fmt=eq}}) and gave the contract out to the industry. Chrysler and GM entered bids.<ref name=bail>{{cite newspaper |newspaper= Washington Monthly |date=1987  |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+first+Chrysler+bail-out%3b+the+M-1+tank.-a04696991 |title= The First Chrysler Bail-Out: The M-1 Tank}}</ref>\n\n===More changes===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2019}}\nThrough the period while the initial prototypes were being  built, a debate broke out between Germany and US about the use of the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Army was planning on introducing several new types of ammunition for the 105 that would greatly improve its performance, notably, the XM-774 using [[depleted uranium]]. These rounds would give it the performance needed to defeat any Soviet tank with ease. There was some concern that depleted uranium would not be allowed in Germany, perhaps just in peacetime, so improvements to the tungsten cored M735 were also considered.\n\nThrough this same period, there was an ongoing effort to improve [[NATO]] logistics by standardizing ammunition to the maximum possible degree. The Germans were moving ahead with their 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Leopard 2K, and noted that the British had also introduced a 120&nbsp;mm gun of their own in keeping with their long-range combat doctrine. Although initially skeptical of the need for a 120&nbsp;mm gun, at some point the issue was raised that the Soviets might introduce a tank with composite armor. In this case, the 120 would give them the performance needed to defeat such a development even without depleted uranium.\n\nBy 1977 the decision had been made to eventually move the new tank to a 120&nbsp;mm gun. After head-to-head testing between the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5]] and the [[Rheinmetall Rh-120]], the latter was chosen. The turret designs of the two prototypes were modified to allow either gun to be fitted.\n\n===Prototypes===\nPrototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and [[General Motors]] (GM) armed with the license-built version of the 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]]. They entered head-to-head testing at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], along with a [[Leopard 2]] \"2K\" prototype for comparison. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems.<ref name=bail/>\n\nDuring testing, the power packs of both designs proved to have issues. The Chrysler design used a [[gas turbine]] engine from [[Lycoming Engines]], the [[Honeywell AGT1500|AGT1500]], which had extensive heat recovery systems in an attempt to improve its [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] to something similar to a traditional [[internal combustion engine]]. This proved not to be the case; the engine consumed much more fuel than expected. The GM design used a new variable-compression Diesel design which proved to be problematic.<ref name=bail/> There is no evidence that GM considered using the [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine of the MBT-70, which outperformed both and had been chosen for the Leopard 2K.\n\nBy the spring of 1977, the decision to choose the GM design was largely complete. In addition to offering better overall performance, there were concerns about Chrysler's engine both from a reliability and fuel consumption standpoint. The GM program was also slightly cheaper overall at $208 million compared to $221 million for Chrysler. In July 1977, Lt. Colonel George Mohrmann prepared a stack of letters informing Congress of the decision to move ahead with the GM design. All that was required was the final sign-off by the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]].<ref name=bail/>\n\n=== Chrysler is chosen ===\nOn 20 July, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] Martin Hoffman and a group of generals visited [[Deputy Defense Secretary]] [[Bill Clements]] and [[Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard arguments from both in the afternoon and asked for twenty-four hours to review the issues. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.<ref name=bail/>\n\nWithin days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, \"It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.\"<ref name=bail/> However, the Chrysler design had the advantage that the entire power pack had room to be replaced by any number of engine designs, including a Diesel if needed.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nThe turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision. Chrysler was the only company that appeared to be seriously interested in tank development; the M60 had been lucrative for the company and relied on that program for much of its profit. In contrast, GM made only about 1% of its income from military sales, compared to 5% for Chrysler, and only submitted their bid after a \"special plea\" from the Pentagon.<ref name=bail/>\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the Defense Department awarded a $20 billion development contract to Chrysler.<ref name=bail/>\n\n===Production starts===\nLow initial rate production (LIRP) of the vehicle was approved on 7 May 1979.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book |title=Abrams: A History of the American Main Battle Tank |last=Hunnicutt |first=R.P. |publisher=Presidio |year=1990 |isbn=9780891413882 |pages=202}}</ref> In February 1982, [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] Division (GDLS) purchased Chrysler Defense, after Chrysler built over 1,000 M1s.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Dynamics buys Chrysler tank division|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html|publisher=New York Times, 20 February 1982 |accessdate=3 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403195514/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html |archivedate=3 April 2017 }}</ref> The M1 Abrams was the first vehicle to adopt [[Chobham armor]].\n\n[[File:105mm cannon on an M1 Abrams tank, 1986.png|thumb|left|105 mm M1 Abrams tank of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Grafenw\u00f6hr Training Area in Germany, 1986]]\nA total of 3,273 M1 Abrams tanks were produced during 1979\u20131985 and first entered U.S. Army service in 1980.

Some units painted their M1s with the older Mobility Equipment Research and Design Command (MERDC) 4-color paint scheme but the turn-in requirements for these tanks required repainting them to overall forest green. Therefore, even though a large number of the base model M1s were camouflaged in the field, few or none exist today.\n\nM1A1s came from the factory with the NATO three color camouflage Black/Med-Green/Dark-Brown [[Chemical Agent Resistant Coating]] (CARC) paint jobs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Today M1A1s are given the NATO three color paint job during rebuilds. M1s and M1A1s deployed to [[Operation Desert Storm]] were hastily painted [[desert tan]]. Some, but not all, of these tanks were re-painted to their \"authorized\" paint scheme. M1A2s built for Middle Eastern countries were painted in desert tan. Replacement parts (roadwheels, armor skirt panels, drive sprockets, etc.) are painted olive green, which can sometimes lead to vehicles with a patchwork of green and desert tan parts.\n\nAustralian M1A1s were desert tan when delivered but have undergone a transition to the Australian Army vehicle standard 'Disruptive Pattern Camouflage'; a scheme that consists of black, olive drab, and brown.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Miller |url=http://www.mheaust.com.au/Aust/Research/Abrams.htm |title=Australian Military Vehicles Research -Disruptive Pattern Camouflage for the Australian Abrams M1A1 AIM SA (as at 2010) |publisher=Mheaust.com.au |accessdate=28 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110249/http://www.mheaust.com.au/Aust/Research/Abrams.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}{{self-published source|date=July 2011}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Australian Government, Department of Defence |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/may/20100513/index.htm |title=Exercise Chong Ju \u2013 Desert tan vs Auscam Abrams |publisher=Defence.gov.au |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729121247/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/may/20100513/index.htm |archivedate=29 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army can equip its Abrams tanks with the Saab Barracuda [[Multi-spectral camouflage|camouflage system]], which provides concealment against visual, infrared, thermal infrared, and broad-band radar detection.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/june_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/u.s._army_orders_saab_barracuda_camouflage_solutions_31206152.html U.S. Army Orders Saab Barracuda Camouflage Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615013237/http://www.armyrecognition.com/june_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/u.s._army_orders_saab_barracuda_camouflage_solutions_31206152.html |date=15 June 2015}} \u2013 Armyrecognition.com, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n====Concealment====\nThe turret is fitted with two six-barreled [[M250 grenade launcher|M250]] [[smoke grenade]] launchers (USMC M1A1s use an eight-barreled version), with one on each side.

HEAT and sabot rounds will make it through the beginning layers of armor but won't make it to the crew compartment. Ceramics have an ability to absorb a lot of heat, and take physical blows. The remaining hot gasses and metal shrapnel spread out or settle in empty air pockets. Both contractors reevaluated their proposed armor configurations based upon the newly obtained data. This led to major changes in the General Motors XM1. The most prominent of which is the turret front changing from vertical to sloped armor. The Chrysler XM1 on the other hand retained its basic shape although a number of changes were made. The Ballistic Research Laboratory had to develop new armor combinations in order to accommodate the changes made by the contractors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=R.P.|title=Abrams: A History of the American MBT|date=1990|publisher=Presidio|page=178}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to most other main battle tanks, the M1 Abrams feature composite armor only on the frontal aspect of the hull. However, the Abrams' turret features composite armoring across both the front and the sides. In addition, the side skirts of the frontal half of the hull are also made of composite, providing superior ballistic protection against chemical energy munitions such as HEAT rounds. The composition of the Abrams' composite armor consists of sandwiched plates of non-explosive [[reactive armor]] (NERA) between conventional steel plates. The NERA plates feature elasticity, allowing them to flex and distort upon perforation, disrupting the penetrating jets of shaped charges and providing more material and space for a kinetic round to pass through, thus providing increased protection compared to conventional steel armor of similar weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|title=Below The Turret Ring: Early M1 Abrams composite armor|last=M.m|date=18 January 2017|website=Below The Turret Ring|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409002252/https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|archive-date=9 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor the base model M1 Abrams, [[Steven Zaloga|Steven J.

A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.\n\nArmor upgrades include [[reactive armor]] on the sides of the tank and [[Cage armor|slat armor]] (similar to that on the [[Stryker]]) on the rear to protect against [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and other shaped charge warheads. A [[Transparent Armor Gun Shield]] and a thermal sight system are added to the loader's top-mounted M240B 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun, and a [[Kongsberg Gruppen]] Remote Weapon Turret carrying a 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun (again similar to that used on the Stryker) is in place of the tank commander's original 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun mount, wherein the commander had to expose himself to fire the weapon manually. An exterior [[telephone]] allows supporting infantry to communicate with the tank commander.\n\nThe TUSK system is a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be upgraded without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in [[maneuver warfare]], items like the rear slat armor, loader's gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the 12.7 mm (.50&nbsp;in) caliber machine gun will be added to the entire M1A2 fleet over time.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, General Dynamics Land Systems received a U.S. Army order for 505 Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK) for Abrams main battle tanks supporting operations in Iraq, under a US$45&nbsp;million contract.

The later M1A2 variant had a 'flex' mount that required the tank commander to expose his or her upper torso in order to fire the weapon. In urban environments in Iraq, this was found to be unsafe. With the Common Remote Operated Weapons System ([[CROWS]]) add-on kit, an M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine gun, M240, or M249 SAW can be mounted on a CROWS remote weapons platform (similar to the [[Protector (RWS)|Protector M151]] remote weapon station used on the [[Stryker]] family of vehicles). Current variants of the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) on the M1A2 have forgone this, instead adding transparent gun shields to the commander's weapon station.

These three components are determined using a [[laser rangefinder]], crosswind sensor, a [[pendulum]] static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by tracking rate tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:DA-SD-06-06814.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment soldier, assisting in the critical job of \"boresighting\" the alignment of all the tank's sights to the center of the axis of the bore of the main gun on an M1A1 Abrams in [[Mosul, Iraq]] in January 2005.

The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95&nbsp;percent at nominal ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 can be used to locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]] to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable [[crosshair|reticles]]; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks in the event of a Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB .50&nbsp;caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3\u00d7 magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own [[iron sights]], or a remote aiming system such as the [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] system when used as part of the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit|TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit)]]. The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn late 2017, the 400 USMC M1A1 Abrams will be upgraded with better and longer-range sights on the Abrams integrated display and targeting system (AIDATS) replacing the black-and-white camera view with a color one and adding day/night thermal sights, simplified handling with a single set of controls, and a slew to cue button that repositions the turret with a single command. Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target engagement time from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ Abrams Tank Upgrades Will Give Marines \u2018Killer Edge\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824062936/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ |date=24 August 2016}} \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 23 August 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome Marines' M1A1 tanks: How an upgrade will help make them more lethal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827201232/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome |date=27 August 2016}} \u2013 MarineCorpstimes.com, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n\n====Tactical====\n[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into the tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003.]]\n\nThe M1 Abrams's [[powertrain]] consists of a [[Honeywell]] [[AGT-1500|AGT 1500]] (originally made by [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]]) [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine]] capable of {{convert|1500|shp|kW|sp=us}} at 3,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|3950|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 1,000 rpm, and a six-speed (four forward, two reverse) [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic [[automatic transmission]], giving it a governed top speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on paved roads, and {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cross-country.

The improved engine and tracks are not part of an Army upgrade program, but may be included in a near-term engineering change proposal (ECP) phase.<ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-a-modest-proposal/ Abrams Dieselization Project: A Modest Proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185057/http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-a-modest-proposal/ |date=10 November 2013}} \u2013 Defensemedianetwork.com, 5 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-doing-the-math/ Abrams Dieselization Project: Doing the Math] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185059/http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-doing-the-math/ |date=10 November 2013}} \u2013 Defensemedianetwork.com, 7 November 2013</ref>\n\nUsing a high power density {{convert|330|cc|in3|abbr=on}} [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]] modified to use diesel and military grade jet fuel, the Army's [[United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center|TARDEC]] developed a {{convert|220|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] designed to fit into the M1 Abrams, replacing an existing battery pack that weighs about {{convert|500|lb|kg}}.

The Abrams can be carried by a [[C-5 Galaxy]] or a [[C-17 Globemaster III]]. The limited capacity (two combat-ready tanks in a C-5, one combat-ready tank in a C-17) caused serious logistical problems when deploying the tanks for the first Persian Gulf War, though there was enough time for 1,848 tanks to be transported by ship.\n\nMarines transport their [[Marine Air Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF)-attached Abrams tanks by combat ship. A ''[[Wasp class amphibious assault ship|Wasp]]''-class [[Landing Helicopter Dock]] (LHD) typically carries a platoon of 4 to 5 tanks attached to the deployed [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]], which are then amphibiously transported to shore by [[Landing Craft Air Cushion]] (LCAC) at 1 combat-ready tank per landing craft.\n\nThe Abrams is also transportable by truck, namely the [[Oshkosh M1070 heavy equipment transporter|M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter]] (HET). The HET can operate on highways, secondary roads, and cross-country. The HET accommodates the four tank crew members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/m1070.html |title=M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) Fact File United States Army |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020118/http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/m1070.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first instance of the Abrams being airlifted directly into a battlefield occurred in October 1993.

FAS.org, 14 April 2000.</ref> Conceived for modern [[Armoured warfare|armored ground warfare]] and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 [[short ton]]s (almost 62 [[metric ton]]s), it introduced several innovative features, including a [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine|turbine engine]], sophisticated [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] [[composite armor]], a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun, while later variants feature a licensed [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44]].\n\nThe M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the [[MBT-70]] project to replace the obsolescent [[M60 Patton]]. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009.<ref name=\"Armylooking2009\" />{{update after|2019|6|17}} Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D (formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively) versions such as improved [[composite armor]], better optics, digital systems and ammunition.<ref>{{citation |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Inside the US Army's Lethal New M1A2 SEP v.3 Abrams Main Battle Tank |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190927/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Abrams was due to be replaced by the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Future Combat Systems XM1202]] but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\n\nThe M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The export version is used by the armies of [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]], [[Kuwaiti Army|Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabian Army|Saudi Arabia]], [[Australian Army|Australia]], and [[Iraqi Army|Iraq]]. The Abrams was first used in combat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and has seen combat in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in [[International military intervention against ISIL|the war against ISIL]] and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the M1 Abrams}}\n\n===Previous developments===\n{{main|MBT-70}}\n\nThrough the 1960s the US Army and German Army had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the [[M60 Patton]] and the [[Leopard 1]]. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the [[T-62]], while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] gun and especially [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |title=Licht vom Mond |accessdate=2010-11-08 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112816/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} \n\nThe resulting design, the [[MBT-70]], incorporated new technologies across the board. A [[hydropneumatic suspension]] provided excellent cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver, with the lowest position placing the top of the tank only {{convert|6|feet}} off the ground. New 1,500&nbsp;hp-class engines powered the designs which could both reach {{convert|43|mph}}, 50% faster than the T-62. Finally, two new guns were introduced, a US 152&nbsp;mm design whose primary long-range weapon was the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missile]], while the Germans introduced a new [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|120 mm smoothbore]] design.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/>\n\nWhile the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget. By 1969, the unit cost stood at five times the original estimates.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/> In August 1969 the Senate halted funding of the program until the [[Government Accounting Office]] could undertake an audit of the program.<ref name=\"GAO Audit\">{{cite news |last1=Weaver Jr. |first1=Warren |title=Tank Fund Halted for a Cost Study |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/09/archives/tank-fund-halted-for-a-cost-study-senate-balks-the-pentagon-pending.html |accessdate=26 August 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=9 August 1969 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826113509/https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/09/archives/tank-fund-halted-for-a-cost-study-senate-balks-the-pentagon-pending.html |archive-date=26 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Starting afresh===\nAs a result of the problems with the MBT-70, the U.S. Army introduced the XM803, using some technologies from the MBT-70 but removing some of the more troublesome features. This succeeded only in producing an expensive system with capabilities similar to the M60.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title=MBT-70 / XM803 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823045247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010 }}</ref> Congress canceled the MBT-70 in November and XM803 December 1971, and redistributed the funds to the XM1 Abrams named after General [[Creighton Abrams]].\n\nThe [[Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] (TACOM) began examining specific goals. After several rounds of input, the decision was made to offer maximum armor to defeat the \"heavy threat\". Heavy in this context considered the 115&nbsp;mm gun of the T-62 using projected improvements of their [[APFSDS]] ammunition through the 1980s, or the new 125&nbsp;mm gun of the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]] firing [[high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nTo this end, a new design basis emerged in February 1973, LK 10372. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 meters and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the [[Royal Ordnance L7]], along with a coaxial 20&nbsp;mm version of the [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nExamining the experiences of the [[Yom Kippur War]] that year, a number of design changes were made. The newly-created [[Chobham armour|\"Burlington\" armor]] from the [[British Army]]'s labs was incorporated to improve protection, especially against HEAT, and to incorporate the new armor package, the original goal of keeping weight under {{convert|50|ST}} was abandoned. The Bushmaster was seen as superfluous and was replaced with a [[M240 machine gun]], the US version of the [[FN MAG]]. As TACOM continued to improve the detailed design, initial samples of the armor system were sent to the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] for testing.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nAt the time, the US military's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best possible design. This often resulted in the programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars ({{inflation|US|507000|1972|fmt=eq}}) and gave the contract out to the industry. Chrysler and GM entered bids.<ref name=bail>{{cite newspaper |newspaper= Washington Monthly |date=1987  |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+first+Chrysler+bail-out%3b+the+M-1+tank.-a04696991 |title= The First Chrysler Bail-Out: The M-1 Tank}}</ref>\n\n===More changes===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2019}}\nThrough the period while the initial prototypes were being  built, a debate broke out between Germany and US about the use of the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Army was planning on introducing several new types of ammunition for the 105 that would greatly improve its performance, notably, the XM-774 using [[depleted uranium]]. These rounds would give it the performance needed to defeat any Soviet tank with ease. There was some concern that depleted uranium would not be allowed in Germany, perhaps just in peacetime, so improvements to the tungsten cored M735 were also considered.\n\nThrough this same period, there was an ongoing effort to improve [[NATO]] logistics by standardizing ammunition to the maximum possible degree. The Germans were moving ahead with their 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Leopard 2K, and noted that the British had also introduced a 120&nbsp;mm gun of their own in keeping with their long-range combat doctrine. Although initially skeptical of the need for a 120&nbsp;mm gun, at some point the issue was raised that the Soviets might introduce a tank with composite armor. In this case, the 120 would give them the performance needed to defeat such a development even without depleted uranium.\n\nBy 1977 the decision had been made to eventually move the new tank to a 120&nbsp;mm gun. After head-to-head testing between the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5]] and the [[Rheinmetall Rh-120]], the latter was chosen. The turret designs of the two prototypes were modified to allow either gun to be fitted.\n\n===Prototypes===\nPrototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and [[General Motors]] (GM) armed with the license-built version of the 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]]. They entered head-to-head testing at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], along with a [[Leopard 2]] \"2K\" prototype for comparison. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems.<ref name=bail/>\n\nDuring testing, the power packs of both designs proved to have issues. The Chrysler design used a [[gas turbine]] engine from [[Lycoming Engines]], the [[Honeywell AGT1500|AGT1500]], which had extensive heat recovery systems in an attempt to improve its [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] to something similar to a traditional [[internal combustion engine]]. This proved not to be the case; the engine consumed much more fuel than expected. The GM design used a new variable-compression Diesel design which proved to be problematic.<ref name=bail/> There is no evidence that GM considered using the [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine of the MBT-70, which outperformed both and had been chosen for the Leopard 2K.\n\nBy the spring of 1977, the decision to choose the GM design was largely complete. In addition to offering better overall performance, there were concerns about Chrysler's engine both from a reliability and fuel consumption standpoint. The GM program was also slightly cheaper overall at $208 million compared to $221 million for Chrysler. In July 1977, Lt. Colonel George Mohrmann prepared a stack of letters informing Congress of the decision to move ahead with the GM design. All that was required was the final sign-off by the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]].<ref name=bail/>\n\n=== Chrysler is chosen ===\nOn 20 July, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] Martin Hoffman and a group of generals visited [[Deputy Defense Secretary]] [[Bill Clements]] and [[Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard arguments from both in the afternoon and asked for twenty-four hours to review the issues. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.<ref name=bail/>\n\nWithin days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, \"It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.\"<ref name=bail/> However, the Chrysler design had the advantage that the entire power pack had room to be replaced by any number of engine designs, including a Diesel if needed.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nThe turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision.

This led to major changes in the General Motors XM1. The most prominent of which is the turret front changing from vertical to sloped armor. The Chrysler XM1 on the other hand retained its basic shape although a number of changes were made. The Ballistic Research Laboratory had to develop new armor combinations in order to accommodate the changes made by the contractors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=R.P.|title=Abrams: A History of the American MBT|date=1990|publisher=Presidio|page=178}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to most other main battle tanks, the M1 Abrams feature composite armor only on the frontal aspect of the hull.

The NERA plates feature elasticity, allowing them to flex and distort upon perforation, disrupting the penetrating jets of shaped charges and providing more material and space for a kinetic round to pass through, thus providing increased protection compared to conventional steel armor of similar weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|title=Below The Turret Ring: Early M1 Abrams composite armor|last=M.m|date=18 January 2017|website=Below The Turret Ring|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409002252/https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|archive-date=9 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor the base model M1 Abrams, [[Steven Zaloga|Steven J.

A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.\n\nArmor upgrades include [[reactive armor]] on the sides of the tank and [[Cage armor|slat armor]] (similar to that on the [[Stryker]]) on the rear to protect against [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and other shaped charge warheads. A [[Transparent Armor Gun Shield]] and a thermal sight system are added to the loader's top-mounted M240B 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun, and a [[Kongsberg Gruppen]] Remote Weapon Turret carrying a 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun (again similar to that used on the Stryker) is in place of the tank commander's original 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun mount, wherein the commander had to expose himself to fire the weapon manually. An exterior [[telephone]] allows supporting infantry to communicate with the tank commander.\n\nThe TUSK system is a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be upgraded without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in [[maneuver warfare]], items like the rear slat armor, loader's gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the 12.7 mm (.50&nbsp;in) caliber machine gun will be added to the entire M1A2 fleet over time.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, General Dynamics Land Systems received a U.S. Army order for 505 Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK) for Abrams main battle tanks supporting operations in Iraq, under a US$45&nbsp;million contract.

These three components are determined using a [[laser rangefinder]], crosswind sensor, a [[pendulum]] static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by tracking rate tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:DA-SD-06-06814.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment soldier, assisting in the critical job of \"boresighting\" the alignment of all the tank's sights to the center of the axis of the bore of the main gun on an M1A1 Abrams in [[Mosul, Iraq]] in January 2005.

The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95&nbsp;percent at nominal ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 can be used to locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]] to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable [[crosshair|reticles]]; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks in the event of a Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB .50&nbsp;caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3\u00d7 magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own [[iron sights]], or a remote aiming system such as the [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] system when used as part of the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit|TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit)]]. The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn late 2017, the 400 USMC M1A1 Abrams will be upgraded with better and longer-range sights on the Abrams integrated display and targeting system (AIDATS) replacing the black-and-white camera view with a color one and adding day/night thermal sights, simplified handling with a single set of controls, and a slew to cue button that repositions the turret with a single command. Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target engagement time from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ Abrams Tank Upgrades Will Give Marines \u2018Killer Edge\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824062936/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ |date=24 August 2016}} \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 23 August 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome Marines' M1A1 tanks: How an upgrade will help make them more lethal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827201232/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome |date=27 August 2016}} \u2013 MarineCorpstimes.com, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n\n====Tactical====\n[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into the tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003.]]\n\nThe M1 Abrams's [[powertrain]] consists of a [[Honeywell]] [[AGT-1500|AGT 1500]] (originally made by [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]]) [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine]] capable of {{convert|1500|shp|kW|sp=us}} at 3,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|3950|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 1,000 rpm, and a six-speed (four forward, two reverse) [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic [[automatic transmission]], giving it a governed top speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on paved roads, and {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cross-country.

It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name \"chimpanzee\" is first recorded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref> or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of \"[[ape]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}</ref> The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.<ref name=\"Corbey\"/><ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and genetics==\nThe first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the \"[[orangutan|orang-outang]]\" (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]].

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa.

Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees.

Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name \"chimpanzee\" is first recorded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref> or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of \"[[ape]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}</ref> The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.<ref name=\"Corbey\"/><ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and genetics==\nThe first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the \"[[orangutan|orang-outang]]\" (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]].

This allows them to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team, so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy. During an [[arboreal]] hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. \"Drivers\" serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. \"Blockers\" are stationed at the bottom of the trees and climb up to block prey that takes off in a different direction. \"Chasers\" move quickly and try to make a catch.

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa.

Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees.

The influence of both European and African traditions served to further diversify the musical roots of contemporary Sri Lankan music.\n\n== Folk music ==\n<span lang=\"Si\" dir=\"ltr\">Caste</span>-based folk poems, ''Jana Kavi'', originated as communal song shared within individual groups as they engaged in daily work. Today, they remain a popular form of cultural expression. Folk poems were sung by ancient people of Sri Lanka to minimise their loneliness, sadness, tiredness etc. There isn't a known author for the folk poems. \nKavi was also sung to accompany annual rituals. These ancient rites are rarely performed in contemporary Sri Lanka, but the preserved songs are still performed by folk musicians.\n\nAnother traditional Sri Lankan folk style is called the ''Virindu''. It involves an improvised poem sung to the beaten melody of a [[raban]]a. Traditional song contests were held in which two virindu singers would compete through spontaneous verse. The Portuguese influenced [[Baila]] has been a popular folk tradition along the coastal districts in the past five hundred years and is now part of the mainstream music culture.\n\n== Sri Lankan country music ==\nThe art, music and dances of Sri Lanka were derived from ritualistic responses to natural phenomenon. Sri Lanka's earliest folk music was later influenced by the influx of Buddhist traditions. These songs were performed by commoners, and not merely recited by the priestly castes.<ref>[http://serendib.btoptions.lk/article.php?issue=29&id=734 The Percussive Force<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=== Pageantry ===\nSri Lanka has a highly evolved pageantry tradition, which has a unique array of music.\n\n=== Kolam & Puppetry ===\nKolam music is a low country folk tradition of the south-west coast and its use was both in exorcism rituals as a form of healing and in masked comedy and drama.\n\n=== Nurthi Music ===\nNurthi is a stage drama that influenced by Parasi theater as a consequence of arriving the drama troupe in the latter part of the 19th century, which belonged to the Elphinstone Dramatic Company of India. Nurthi is the colloquial Sinhala form of the Sanskrit term \"Nritya\". The music of Nurthi was based on North Indian Music. Don Bastian of Dehiwala introduced Nurti firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then John De Silva developed it and performed Ramayanaya in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|title=Music of Sri Lanka can be divided into seven categories as seen today.|url=http://www.mysrilanka.com/travel/lanka/art/music.htm|website=Sri Lanka music|accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Sinhala light music ===\nSome artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. Ananda Samarakone was the pioneer of this attempt also composing the Sri Lankan National Anthem. Then Sunil Santha who also did not stick to Hindustani music introduced light music of his own, influenced by the Geethika ([[hymn|Christian hymns]]) tradition of Sri Lanka. [[Pandit]] [[Amaradeva]] is credited as the major contributor to the development of this genre into a truly Sri Lankan style.\n\nIt is enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, Nadagam music, Noorthy music and others too. Most of the musician in Sri Lanka have come out with their own creations\nThe temple paintings and carvings used birds, elephants, wild animals, flowers and trees. The colors were made of nature.\nThe Traditional 18 Dances display the dancing of Birds and Animals.\n\nMayura Wannama - The dance of the Peacock\nHanuma Wannama - The dance of the Monkey\nGajaga Wannama - The dance of the elephant\nThuraga Wannama - The dance of the horse\n\nThe Music is several kinds. The folk music is created with few instruments only and the frequency range is narrowly. The folk songs and poems were used in social gatherings to work together. The Indian influenced Classical Music has grown to be unique.<ref>http://www.naadro.com/#home</ref><ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2009/11/29/mon05.asp Sri Lanka News | Sundayobserver.lk<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090145/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=%2F2009%2F11%2F29%2Fmon05.asp |date=3 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/11/15/mon50.asp Montage - Cultural paradigm | Sundayobserver.lk - Sri Lanka<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426060454/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/11/15/mon50.asp |date=26 April 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/2010/09/11/fea50.asp Features | Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse Newspapers<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004051/http://www.dailynews.lk/2010/09/11/fea50.asp |date=11 February 2013 }}</ref>\nThe traditional drama, music and songs are typically Sri Lankan.\n\n=== Sri Lanka's traditional musical instruments ===\nThe classical Sinhalese Orchestra consists of five categories of instruments.

Among these, seven remain in use:\n\n* '''G\u00e1ta B\u00e9ra''' - Also referred to as the ''Kandyan Drum''; it is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum, that is played by hand).\n* '''Thamm\u00e1tama''' - A twin-drum (similar to the [[bongo drum|bongo]]) that is played with two sticks instead of by hand.\n* '''Yak B\u00e9ra''' - Also referred to as the ''Low Country Drum''; it is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum, that is played by both hands (one in one side).\n* '''Ud\u00e1kkiya''' - A small, hour-glass shaped drum, that is played with one hand while the other hand modifies the tension of a cloth wrapped around its centre (thereby changing the pitch of the drum-head).\n* '''Hand R\u0103b\u0101na''' - A drum similar to the [[tambourine]] (except in that it does not possess metal jingles)\n* '''Da\u016dla''' - A double-headed, barrel-shaped drum played by hand (on one side), and by a stick (on the opposite side).\n* '''Bench R\u0103b\u0101na''' - Similar to the ''hand rabana'', except larger (it is often played by three to eight individuals simultaneously).\n\nIn addition to these drums, a new drum was recently created (in 2000) by Sri Lankan musician [[Kalasoori Piyas\u0101ra Shilpadhipathi]], referred to as the '''Ga\u016dla''' - it is a barrel-shaped instrument containing one head from the ''G\u00e1ta B\u00e9ra'', and one from the Da\u016dla. A set of rudiments (practice rhythms) were also created by him to accommodate the instrument's unique tone.\n\nAlso in addition to these drums, the '''dh\u014dlki''' is also used by many musicians - though this drum is believed to have descended from those brought to Sri Lanka from India - unlike the aforementioned instruments; which are believed to have existed in Sri Lanka prior to the arrival of the first Indian explorers (though this is difficult to verify due to the proximity of the two nations to one another - it is impossible to say, with any degree of certainty, that no cultural exchange occurred between the peoples of southern India and Sri Lanka prior to any particular date in history).\n\nIn 2011, an eBook and a small print book were published with basic playing technique for the Thammattama drum, using Western Notation as a basis. The title is \"[https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Lankan-Drumming-Michael-Balonek/dp/1466300337/ Sri Lankan Drumming: The Thammattama]\" published by BookBrewer (eBook) and CreateSpace (Print Book).\n\n=== Ravanahatha ===\n{{See also|Ravanahatha}}\nThe [[Ravanahatha]] is a crude violin made of coconut shell, bamboo and goat skin, with a natural fibre serving as the string. Goat and sheep gut and coconut wood are also used. It is believed to be the first stringed instrument to be played with a bow and is recognized as the world's first violin.\n\nThe Ravanahatha or Ravana's hand is mentioned in the ancient Indian epic '[[Ramayana]]'. The Ravanahatha sounds like the north Indian instruments Sarangi and Esraj.\n[[Dinesh Subasinghe]] has re-introduced this instrument to Sri Lankan media in 2007 and launched the first CD using the instrument, ''Rawana Nada''.\n<ref>(8 March 2015)[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150308/magazine/dinesh-records-highest-sale-for-an-instrumental-139029.html 'highest sale for an instrumental'].''[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]]''. Retrieved 8 February 2015</ref>\n\n== Western music ==\n[[European classical music|Western classical music]] has been studied and performed in Sri Lanka since its introduction during the [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese colonial period]] of the 15th century. The upper middle-class and upper-class citizens of the country traditionally formed the pedagogues, students, and audience of the Western classical tradition in the country, although western music is also offered as a subject at secondary schools and at tertiary level. The [[Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka]] is one of the oldest western orchestras in South Asia. The foundation of the National Youth Orchestra has helped increase interest and participation more widely in society and among young people outside Colombo. Many Sri Lankans have continued to reach the upper echelons of classical performance, including world-renowned cellist [[Rohan de Saram]], pianist Rohan de Silva,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accnct.org/biodesilva.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010093314/http://www.accnct.org/biodesilva.html |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and many other composers, organists, and orchestral performers.\n\n==Recorded music==\nThe earliest stars of Sri Lankan recorded music came from the [[theater]] at a time when the traditional open-air drama (referred to in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as {{transl|si|kolam}}, {{transl|si|sokari}} or {{transl|si|nadagam}}) remained the most popular form of entertainment. A 1903 album, entitled '''Nurthi''', is the first recorded album to come out of Sri Lanka via [[Radio Ceylon]]. The station, which had long held a monopoly over Sri Lanka's airwaves, had been established in 1925, and one of Sri Lanka's pioneering broadcasters, [[Vernon Corea]], almost immediately grasped the opportunity to introduce Sri Lankan Music on the English Services of Radio Ceylon.\n\nIn the wake of western and Indian proliferation in music, composer and singer Ananda Samarakoon emerged from training at Rabindranath Tagore's school at Shanthiketalan to develop a uniquely Sinhalese music tradition in 1939. His work such as \"Punchi Suda\", \"Ennada Manike\" and notably \"Namo Namo Maata\" (adapted as Sri Lanka's national anthem later) was a landmark of the Sinhalese song, which was known as Sarala Gee later. Another artist Devar Surya Sena with his Western education was pivotal in popularising folk songs of Sri Lanka to the English elite that bore higher status in the country at the time.\n\n''[[Kadawunu Poronduwa]]'' in 1947 brought about a film industry in Sri Lanka. In the late 1940s and 1950s Sinhalese film music became the most popular with audiences; it was drawn heavily upon melodies found in [[Bollywood|Hindi]] and [[Kollywood|Tamil]] films - adapted to a Sri Lankan audience by substituting their original lyrics with Sinhala lyrics. Meanwhile, musicians like [[W. D. Amaradeva]], [[Sunil Santha]], [[W.B. Makuloluwa]] etc. began experimenting with developing a Sinhalese music style.\n\nSunil Santha took a Western approach in his work inspired from Church music. He opposed of getting elements from Hindustani \"Raaga\" music to develop Sinhalese music. This was evident when he was later banned from Radio Ceylon after refusing to audition for Indian musician Ratanjankar, whom the corporation had brought from South India to oversee the direction of music on their stations.\n\n[[Pandit]] [[Amaradeva]], trained at [[Bhatkhande Vidyapith, Lucknow, India]], took up the \"Sarala Gee\" tradition along with experimentation of raaga forms and folk music. This became popular in the country especially through sarala gee programs broadcast in Radio Ceylon. Musicians such as [[Victor Ratnayake]], [[Sanath Nandasiri]], T. Shelton Perera, [[Gunadasa Kapuge]], [[Rohana Weerasinghe]] Stanley Peiris, Austin Munasinghe, [[Sunil Edirisinghe]], [[Edward Jayakody]], [[Amarasiri Peiris]] and Rookantha Gunathilaka brought the system forward the.Shelton Premaratne and Lional Algama are two musicians, who added new dimensions to Sinhalese music.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nW. B. Makulolouwa and C de S Kulatilake, believed Sinhalese music should follow the traditions of its folk music called \"Jana Gee\". Makuloluwa gathered a great many of Sinhalese folk poems traveling around the country and tried to develop a unique style. Late musicians like [[Lionel Ranwala]], [[Rohana Beddage]] contributed in developing Makuloluwa's \"Jana Gee\" style.\n\n[[Premasiri Khemadasa]] also known as \"Khemadasa Master\" was one of the most influential composers in Sri Lankan music. Inspiring from Western Classical music, Hindustani music and also Sinhalese folk music he composed in his own style which has been popular since late 1960s. He was one of the most highly regarded film, stage and TV drama composers and his music is still used by the best directors in the country.\n\nPivotal to the works of these musicians were songwriters like [[Mahagama Sekara]] and [[Chandraratne Manawasinghe]] who in their lyrics presented deeply poetic, and honestly expressed, ideas - many of which also promoted a sense of [[nationalism]] in a nation that had received independence less than a generation before in 1948.\n\nWith the dawn of the 1960s and government restrictions on travel to India original compositions became in vogue in film music though a few popular films continued to tout stolen melodies under the hands of music arrangers like P. L. A. Somapala and Mohomed Sally.\n\nThe mid-1960s, saw the introduction of ''pop'' groups such as Los cabelleros led by Neville Fernando, La Ceylonians led by Noel Ranasinghe (widely known as \"King of Sri Lankan Calypso\"), [[La Bambas|The La Bambas]], [[Humming Birds (band)|The Humming Birds]] and [[Los Muchachos]]; all of whom played [[calypso-style baila]] borrowing their style from Caribbean folk-singer [[Harry Belafonte]]. This mixture of [[Caribbean]] [[calypso music|calypso]] with native baila was dominated by two groups: [[The Moonstones]], and [[Golden Chimes|The Golden Chimes]] led by musicians [[Annesley Malewana]] and [[Clarence Wijewardene]].\n\nSri Lankan pop/film music managed to hold a large portion of Sri Lanka's market during the late 1960s and early 1970s, but by 1980, Indian film music had again displaced local musicians as the highest-selling sector of the Sri Lankan music industry. In the 1980s the disco-pop musician [[Rookantha Gunathilake]] emerged to become one of the most popular artists of the time. Many young musicians followed Rookantha and his style in 1980s and 1990s.\nAfter 2000, young musicians like [[Bathiya and Santhush]], Kasun Kalhara, Shihan Mihiranga, continued the pop song stream introducing new features into it. After 2008 Darshana Ruwan Disanayaka, [[Nadeeka Guruge]], [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] has done some inspiring works & become the most influential composers in Sri Lankan cinema after achieving many awards in Movie festivals.\n\nMIDI/Computer based music performances and recording were introduced to Sri Lanka in the 1980s by Keyboardist/composer Diliup Gabadamudalige. He was the first to use a complete MIDI based performing keyboard setup and also use MIDI/Sequencers and Music software/Computer based music recording and performances in Sri Lanka. Diliups contribution has been recognized by the Government of Sri Lanka and he has been awarded the Kalashuri title and was also awarded the first Lyle Godrich Memorial Award for Contribution to the western Music Industry in Sri Lanka in 2011.\n\n[[The Gypsies (Sri Lankan band)|The Gypsies]] has remained a popular band for over four decades and the [[Sunflowers (band)]] is the most widely recorded group for nearly three decades.\n\nSince 1998, Many Pop/R&B groups have emerged in Sri Lanka - the most prominent of which is known as [[Bathiya and Santhush]]\u2014who draw inspiration from the Euro pop groups that visited the island. Among their accomplishments; they are the first Sri Lankan group to be signed to an international record label (Sony BMG), and were an integral component in the label's entrance into the nation's music industry in 2002/2003. They have received international awards for their compositions, and have performed in several countries - including on BBC radio in the UK.\n\n[[Dinesh Subasinghe]]'s Movie score for [[Ho Gana Pokuna]] became a popular & a memorable score in Sri Lankan cinema in 2016, he has won awards in all the cinema festivals held in Sri Lanka in 2016<ref>''[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]''(21 February 2017).[http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/02/21/entertainment/108175/%E2%80%98immortal%E2%80%99-mission \"Immortal mission\"].Retrieved 21 February 2017</ref>\n\n==Sinhala Music Archives==\n[[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (Former [[Radio Ceylon]]) is considered as the largest [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] Music archive. Some other private archives also are there that promote Sinhala country music commercially or non-commercially.<ref>{{cite web|title=When Ceylon ruled the airwaves|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/when-ceylon-ruled-the-airwaves/article3219259.ece}}</ref>\n\n== Rock & Heavy Metal Music ==\nRock Music in Sri Lanka dates back to the early 1970s when Kumar Navaratnam and friends staged the first Rock Festival at the Havelock Park in Colombo Sri Lanka. Kumara Navaratnam could be hailed as the Main strength behind the evolving rock music scene then along with others like Prins Jayaratnam and the Unwanted Generation, Prasanna Abeysekara's Coffin Nail, Neville of Acid, Gobbledegook and Sweetie Pie, which was led by pianist Nimal Goonawardane, Mary was the only Rock band to play all original music at that time and was led by Ravi Balasooriya of \"Bugs\" fame. Other members being Aruna Siriwardane, Benjy Ranabahu, Dilup Gabadamudalige and Dwight Van Gramberg. Ramesh Weeratunga, who was a composer/solo performer of this period, went on to become a professional musician/songwriter in Germany, releasing several solo albums.\n\nWith the exception of a handful of senior college students who obviously had recourse to vinyl LP's and music trade papers, the rest of Sri Lanka's music enthusiasts had to rely on the occasional radio program such as \"Progressive 30\" presented by Mahes Perera to vaguely ascertain the evolving soundscape of the 70's or listening to the vinyl records at the British Council and the American Center.\n\nWhat was later to become \"Rock Company\" had its start around this time. The self same college students acquired guitars, drum kits, keyboards, hired rudimentary sound systems and started to hang out together and attempted to recreate the records of their heroes with differing levels of success.\n\nAll this without the aid of decent guitars, effects pedals, drum kits, synthesizers, sophisticated PA systems or recording studios! The first ever Rock events in Sri Lanka revolved around bands such as \"The Unwanted Generation\", \"Graveyard\" and \"Coffin Nail\" featuring such musicians as Prins Jayaratnam, Chris Dhasan, Nimal Gunawardena, Ramesh Weeratunga, Imtiaz Hameed and Kumar Navaratnam responsible for organizing extravagant rock concerts featuring multiple Sri Lankan bands who introduced Colombo's wide eyed and newly hatched youth culture to the underground sounds streaming in from the UK and the US. The \"Wall Band and Gun Chorus\" that centered on a well known neighbourhood hangout in Colombo 6 spawned a lot of the aforesaid musicians.\n\nA few years later, another important milestone was attained with the formation of \"Cancer,\" the first ever Sri Lankan band that took the initial step of composing and playing its own material. Led by Prasanna Abeysekera and his brother Ranil, together with a cast of musicians that included Brian Knower, Leo Pasquale, Sumedha Kulatunga and sundry other enthusiasts, \"Cancer\" defiantly rocked to a different beat.\n\nOne that they could truly call their own. However, the lack of recording facilities and a proper medium to spread the band's original output ensured that only a tiny handful would appreciate their attempts at creating a Sri Lankan rock identity.\n\n\"Cancer\" and their ilk, did find a regular hangout where they and like minded bands could rehearse and showcase their abilities to the true believers, within the suitably run down walls of \"Koko's, - the closest local equivalent to a rock venue located in Thimbirigasyaya.\n\nHard on the heels of \"Cancer\" came such luminaries as \"Rattlesnake\" and \"Venom\" who for the most part, played hard rock covers and helped to keep the music alive through the gigs that took place at \"Koko's and other venues. The late 70's saw a notable change in the rock scene with the emergence of a whole new generation of bands with a different agenda- Punk Rock and new wave bands and songwriters reintroduced high energy and a DIY work ethic that flew in the face of established mainstream acts throughout Europe and the US.\n\nLargely unaffected by these changes, Sri Lanka's Rock bands soldiered on until many of the pioneering musicians emigrated or found themselves with little or no time to pursue music as family and economic demands focused their attention away from power chords and heavy riffs. Rock Company itself wound to a close in the late 80's and the decade that followed saw the music being just about kept alive by a handful of devotees along with Rattlesnake, Venom, Cancer and Brass Face.\n\nSri Lanka now has a significant underground metal and hard rock community, which is growing in popularity among upper-middle-class teenagers and young adults. Some internationally known Sri Lankan metal bands include [[Stigmata (band)|Stigmata]], [[Paranoid Earthling]], [[Plecto aliquem capite|Plecto Aliquem Capite]]. Many other bands too have emerged ever since the 1990s making the heavy metal underground much bigger. While Colombo is a breeding ground for many hard rock bands like [[Stigmata (band)|Stigmata]], Kandy gave birth to the pioneer [[Grunge]] outfit [[Paranoid Earthling]], which was the first rock band to emerge from the Hill Capital. Kandy is also the stronghold for [[black metal]] bands like \"Forlorn Hope\" \"Pariah Demise\" \"Necro Horde\" \"Goatmunition\" and some doom metal bands as well.\n\nHistory was made again in Sri Lanka when Shehara released her debut album Fountain of Memory, the country\u2019s first Metal album by a Female in September of 2019.\n\n==References==\n{{portal|Sri Lanka|Music}}\n{{reflist}}\n[https://jayasrilanka.net/albums/artist-by-letters.php Old Sinhala Songs]\n\n==External links==\n{{Prone to spam|date=May 2015}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nDMOZ (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n* [http://www.mysrilanka.com/travel/lanka/art/music.htm Sri Lankan Music]\n\n{{Music of Asia}}\n{{Sinhala songs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Music Of Sri Lanka}}\n[[Category:Sri Lankan music| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=February 2017}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2015}}\nThe '''music of [[Sri Lanka]]''' has its roots in four primary influences: ancient folk rituals, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious traditions, the legacy of [[Europe]]an [[colonisation]], and the commercial and historical influence of nearby [[India]]n culture\u2014specifically, [[Bollywood]] cinema.<ref name=\"Ranashina 2010\">{{cite web|last1=Ranasinha|first1=Ravindra|title=Traditional Drums in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/traditional-drums-in-sri-lanka-10866/|website=Entertainment Scene 360|accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Sri Lanka, landing in the mid-15th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Portuguese in Sri Lanka (1505-1658)|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/portu2.htm|website=Virtual Library - Sri Lanka|accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref> They brought with them traditional [[cantiga]] [[ballad]]s, [[ukulele]]s and [[guitar]]s, as well as conscripted Africans (referred to, historically, as ''kaffrinhas''), who spread their own style of music known as [[baila]]. The influence of both European and African traditions served to further diversify the musical roots of contemporary Sri Lankan music.\n\n== Folk music ==\n<span lang=\"Si\" dir=\"ltr\">Caste</span>-based folk poems, ''Jana Kavi'', originated as communal song shared within individual groups as they engaged in daily work. Today, they remain a popular form of cultural expression. Folk poems were sung by ancient people of Sri Lanka to minimise their loneliness, sadness, tiredness etc. There isn't a known author for the folk poems. \nKavi was also sung to accompany annual rituals. These ancient rites are rarely performed in contemporary Sri Lanka, but the preserved songs are still performed by folk musicians.\n\nAnother traditional Sri Lankan folk style is called the ''Virindu''. It involves an improvised poem sung to the beaten melody of a [[raban]]a. Traditional song contests were held in which two virindu singers would compete through spontaneous verse. The Portuguese influenced [[Baila]] has been a popular folk tradition along the coastal districts in the past five hundred years and is now part of the mainstream music culture.\n\n== Sri Lankan country music ==\nThe art, music and dances of Sri Lanka were derived from ritualistic responses to natural phenomenon. Sri Lanka's earliest folk music was later influenced by the influx of Buddhist traditions. These songs were performed by commoners, and not merely recited by the priestly castes.<ref>[http://serendib.btoptions.lk/article.php?issue=29&id=734 The Percussive Force<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=== Pageantry ===\nSri Lanka has a highly evolved pageantry tradition, which has a unique array of music.\n\n=== Kolam & Puppetry ===\nKolam music is a low country folk tradition of the south-west coast and its use was both in exorcism rituals as a form of healing and in masked comedy and drama.\n\n=== Nurthi Music ===\nNurthi is a stage drama that influenced by Parasi theater as a consequence of arriving the drama troupe in the latter part of the 19th century, which belonged to the Elphinstone Dramatic Company of India. Nurthi is the colloquial Sinhala form of the Sanskrit term \"Nritya\". The music of Nurthi was based on North Indian Music. Don Bastian of Dehiwala introduced Nurti firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then John De Silva developed it and performed Ramayanaya in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|title=Music of Sri Lanka can be divided into seven categories as seen today.|url=http://www.mysrilanka.com/travel/lanka/art/music.htm|website=Sri Lanka music|accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Sinhala light music ===\nSome artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. Ananda Samarakone was the pioneer of this attempt also composing the Sri Lankan National Anthem. Then Sunil Santha who also did not stick to Hindustani music introduced light music of his own, influenced by the Geethika ([[hymn|Christian hymns]]) tradition of Sri Lanka. [[Pandit]] [[Amaradeva]] is credited as the major contributor to the development of this genre into a truly Sri Lankan style.\n\nIt is enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, Nadagam music, Noorthy music and others too. Most of the musician in Sri Lanka have come out with their own creations\nThe temple paintings and carvings used birds, elephants, wild animals, flowers and trees. The colors were made of nature.\nThe Traditional 18 Dances display the dancing of Birds and Animals.\n\nMayura Wannama - The dance of the Peacock\nHanuma Wannama - The dance of the Monkey\nGajaga Wannama - The dance of the elephant\nThuraga Wannama - The dance of the horse\n\nThe Music is several kinds. The folk music is created with few instruments only and the frequency range is narrowly. The folk songs and poems were used in social gatherings to work together.

The dances feet bounce off the floor and they leap and swirl in patterns that reflex the complex rhythms of the drum beat.\n\nThis drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a crescendo of intensity.\n\n==== Gatabera ====\nThe typical Sinhalese Dance is identified as the Kandyan dance and the Gatabera is indispensable to this dance.

Among these, seven remain in use:\n\n* '''G\u00e1ta B\u00e9ra''' - Also referred to as the ''Kandyan Drum''; it is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum, that is played by hand).\n* '''Thamm\u00e1tama''' - A twin-drum (similar to the [[bongo drum|bongo]]) that is played with two sticks instead of by hand.\n* '''Yak B\u00e9ra''' - Also referred to as the ''Low Country Drum''; it is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum, that is played by both hands (one in one side).\n* '''Ud\u00e1kkiya''' - A small, hour-glass shaped drum, that is played with one hand while the other hand modifies the tension of a cloth wrapped around its centre (thereby changing the pitch of the drum-head).\n* '''Hand R\u0103b\u0101na''' - A drum similar to the [[tambourine]] (except in that it does not possess metal jingles)\n* '''Da\u016dla''' - A double-headed, barrel-shaped drum played by hand (on one side), and by a stick (on the opposite side).\n* '''Bench R\u0103b\u0101na''' - Similar to the ''hand rabana'', except larger (it is often played by three to eight individuals simultaneously).\n\nIn addition to these drums, a new drum was recently created (in 2000) by Sri Lankan musician [[Kalasoori Piyas\u0101ra Shilpadhipathi]], referred to as the '''Ga\u016dla''' - it is a barrel-shaped instrument containing one head from the ''G\u00e1ta B\u00e9ra'', and one from the Da\u016dla. A set of rudiments (practice rhythms) were also created by him to accommodate the instrument's unique tone.\n\nAlso in addition to these drums, the '''dh\u014dlki''' is also used by many musicians - though this drum is believed to have descended from those brought to Sri Lanka from India - unlike the aforementioned instruments; which are believed to have existed in Sri Lanka prior to the arrival of the first Indian explorers (though this is difficult to verify due to the proximity of the two nations to one another - it is impossible to say, with any degree of certainty, that no cultural exchange occurred between the peoples of southern India and Sri Lanka prior to any particular date in history).\n\nIn 2011, an eBook and a small print book were published with basic playing technique for the Thammattama drum, using Western Notation as a basis. The title is \"[https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Lankan-Drumming-Michael-Balonek/dp/1466300337/ Sri Lankan Drumming: The Thammattama]\" published by BookBrewer (eBook) and CreateSpace (Print Book).\n\n=== Ravanahatha ===\n{{See also|Ravanahatha}}\nThe [[Ravanahatha]] is a crude violin made of coconut shell, bamboo and goat skin, with a natural fibre serving as the string. Goat and sheep gut and coconut wood are also used. It is believed to be the first stringed instrument to be played with a bow and is recognized as the world's first violin.\n\nThe Ravanahatha or Ravana's hand is mentioned in the ancient Indian epic '[[Ramayana]]'. The Ravanahatha sounds like the north Indian instruments Sarangi and Esraj.\n[[Dinesh Subasinghe]] has re-introduced this instrument to Sri Lankan media in 2007 and launched the first CD using the instrument, ''Rawana Nada''.\n<ref>(8 March 2015)[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150308/magazine/dinesh-records-highest-sale-for-an-instrumental-139029.html 'highest sale for an instrumental'].''[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]]''. Retrieved 8 February 2015</ref>\n\n== Western music ==\n[[European classical music|Western classical music]] has been studied and performed in Sri Lanka since its introduction during the [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese colonial period]] of the 15th century. The upper middle-class and upper-class citizens of the country traditionally formed the pedagogues, students, and audience of the Western classical tradition in the country, although western music is also offered as a subject at secondary schools and at tertiary level. The [[Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka]] is one of the oldest western orchestras in South Asia. The foundation of the National Youth Orchestra has helped increase interest and participation more widely in society and among young people outside Colombo. Many Sri Lankans have continued to reach the upper echelons of classical performance, including world-renowned cellist [[Rohan de Saram]], pianist Rohan de Silva,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accnct.org/biodesilva.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010093314/http://www.accnct.org/biodesilva.html |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and many other composers, organists, and orchestral performers.\n\n==Recorded music==\nThe earliest stars of Sri Lankan recorded music came from the [[theater]] at a time when the traditional open-air drama (referred to in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as {{transl|si|kolam}}, {{transl|si|sokari}} or {{transl|si|nadagam}}) remained the most popular form of entertainment. A 1903 album, entitled '''Nurthi''', is the first recorded album to come out of Sri Lanka via [[Radio Ceylon]]. The station, which had long held a monopoly over Sri Lanka's airwaves, had been established in 1925, and one of Sri Lanka's pioneering broadcasters, [[Vernon Corea]], almost immediately grasped the opportunity to introduce Sri Lankan Music on the English Services of Radio Ceylon.\n\nIn the wake of western and Indian proliferation in music, composer and singer Ananda Samarakoon emerged from training at Rabindranath Tagore's school at Shanthiketalan to develop a uniquely Sinhalese music tradition in 1939. His work such as \"Punchi Suda\", \"Ennada Manike\" and notably \"Namo Namo Maata\" (adapted as Sri Lanka's national anthem later) was a landmark of the Sinhalese song, which was known as Sarala Gee later. Another artist Devar Surya Sena with his Western education was pivotal in popularising folk songs of Sri Lanka to the English elite that bore higher status in the country at the time.\n\n''[[Kadawunu Poronduwa]]'' in 1947 brought about a film industry in Sri Lanka. In the late 1940s and 1950s Sinhalese film music became the most popular with audiences; it was drawn heavily upon melodies found in [[Bollywood|Hindi]] and [[Kollywood|Tamil]] films - adapted to a Sri Lankan audience by substituting their original lyrics with Sinhala lyrics. Meanwhile, musicians like [[W. D. Amaradeva]], [[Sunil Santha]], [[W.B. Makuloluwa]] etc. began experimenting with developing a Sinhalese music style.\n\nSunil Santha took a Western approach in his work inspired from Church music. He opposed of getting elements from Hindustani \"Raaga\" music to develop Sinhalese music. This was evident when he was later banned from Radio Ceylon after refusing to audition for Indian musician Ratanjankar, whom the corporation had brought from South India to oversee the direction of music on their stations.\n\n[[Pandit]] [[Amaradeva]], trained at [[Bhatkhande Vidyapith, Lucknow, India]], took up the \"Sarala Gee\" tradition along with experimentation of raaga forms and folk music. This became popular in the country especially through sarala gee programs broadcast in Radio Ceylon. Musicians such as [[Victor Ratnayake]], [[Sanath Nandasiri]], T. Shelton Perera, [[Gunadasa Kapuge]], [[Rohana Weerasinghe]] Stanley Peiris, Austin Munasinghe, [[Sunil Edirisinghe]], [[Edward Jayakody]], [[Amarasiri Peiris]] and Rookantha Gunathilaka brought the system forward the.Shelton Premaratne and Lional Algama are two musicians, who added new dimensions to Sinhalese music.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nW. B. Makulolouwa and C de S Kulatilake, believed Sinhalese music should follow the traditions of its folk music called \"Jana Gee\". Makuloluwa gathered a great many of Sinhalese folk poems traveling around the country and tried to develop a unique style. Late musicians like [[Lionel Ranwala]], [[Rohana Beddage]] contributed in developing Makuloluwa's \"Jana Gee\" style.\n\n[[Premasiri Khemadasa]] also known as \"Khemadasa Master\" was one of the most influential composers in Sri Lankan music. Inspiring from Western Classical music, Hindustani music and also Sinhalese folk music he composed in his own style which has been popular since late 1960s. He was one of the most highly regarded film, stage and TV drama composers and his music is still used by the best directors in the country.\n\nPivotal to the works of these musicians were songwriters like [[Mahagama Sekara]] and [[Chandraratne Manawasinghe]] who in their lyrics presented deeply poetic, and honestly expressed, ideas - many of which also promoted a sense of [[nationalism]] in a nation that had received independence less than a generation before in 1948.\n\nWith the dawn of the 1960s and government restrictions on travel to India original compositions became in vogue in film music though a few popular films continued to tout stolen melodies under the hands of music arrangers like P. L. A. Somapala and Mohomed Sally.\n\nThe mid-1960s, saw the introduction of ''pop'' groups such as Los cabelleros led by Neville Fernando, La Ceylonians led by Noel Ranasinghe (widely known as \"King of Sri Lankan Calypso\"), [[La Bambas|The La Bambas]], [[Humming Birds (band)|The Humming Birds]] and [[Los Muchachos]]; all of whom played [[calypso-style baila]] borrowing their style from Caribbean folk-singer [[Harry Belafonte]]. This mixture of [[Caribbean]] [[calypso music|calypso]] with native baila was dominated by two groups: [[The Moonstones]], and [[Golden Chimes|The Golden Chimes]] led by musicians [[Annesley Malewana]] and [[Clarence Wijewardene]].\n\nSri Lankan pop/film music managed to hold a large portion of Sri Lanka's market during the late 1960s and early 1970s, but by 1980, Indian film music had again displaced local musicians as the highest-selling sector of the Sri Lankan music industry. In the 1980s the disco-pop musician [[Rookantha Gunathilake]] emerged to become one of the most popular artists of the time. Many young musicians followed Rookantha and his style in 1980s and 1990s.\nAfter 2000, young musicians like [[Bathiya and Santhush]], Kasun Kalhara, Shihan Mihiranga, continued the pop song stream introducing new features into it. After 2008 Darshana Ruwan Disanayaka, [[Nadeeka Guruge]], [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] has done some inspiring works & become the most influential composers in Sri Lankan cinema after achieving many awards in Movie festivals.\n\nMIDI/Computer based music performances and recording were introduced to Sri Lanka in the 1980s by Keyboardist/composer Diliup Gabadamudalige. He was the first to use a complete MIDI based performing keyboard setup and also use MIDI/Sequencers and Music software/Computer based music recording and performances in Sri Lanka. Diliups contribution has been recognized by the Government of Sri Lanka and he has been awarded the Kalashuri title and was also awarded the first Lyle Godrich Memorial Award for Contribution to the western Music Industry in Sri Lanka in 2011.\n\n[[The Gypsies (Sri Lankan band)|The Gypsies]] has remained a popular band for over four decades and the [[Sunflowers (band)]] is the most widely recorded group for nearly three decades.\n\nSince 1998, Many Pop/R&B groups have emerged in Sri Lanka - the most prominent of which is known as [[Bathiya and Santhush]]\u2014who draw inspiration from the Euro pop groups that visited the island. Among their accomplishments; they are the first Sri Lankan group to be signed to an international record label (Sony BMG), and were an integral component in the label's entrance into the nation's music industry in 2002/2003. They have received international awards for their compositions, and have performed in several countries - including on BBC radio in the UK.\n\n[[Dinesh Subasinghe]]'s Movie score for [[Ho Gana Pokuna]] became a popular & a memorable score in Sri Lankan cinema in 2016, he has won awards in all the cinema festivals held in Sri Lanka in 2016<ref>''[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]''(21 February 2017).[http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/02/21/entertainment/108175/%E2%80%98immortal%E2%80%99-mission \"Immortal mission\"].Retrieved 21 February 2017</ref>\n\n==Sinhala Music Archives==\n[[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (Former [[Radio Ceylon]]) is considered as the largest [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] Music archive. Some other private archives also are there that promote Sinhala country music commercially or non-commercially.<ref>{{cite web|title=When Ceylon ruled the airwaves|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/when-ceylon-ruled-the-airwaves/article3219259.ece}}</ref>\n\n== Rock & Heavy Metal Music ==\nRock Music in Sri Lanka dates back to the early 1970s when Kumar Navaratnam and friends staged the first Rock Festival at the Havelock Park in Colombo Sri Lanka. Kumara Navaratnam could be hailed as the Main strength behind the evolving rock music scene then along with others like Prins Jayaratnam and the Unwanted Generation, Prasanna Abeysekara's Coffin Nail, Neville of Acid, Gobbledegook and Sweetie Pie, which was led by pianist Nimal Goonawardane, Mary was the only Rock band to play all original music at that time and was led by Ravi Balasooriya of \"Bugs\" fame. Other members being Aruna Siriwardane, Benjy Ranabahu, Dilup Gabadamudalige and Dwight Van Gramberg. Ramesh Weeratunga, who was a composer/solo performer of this period, went on to become a professional musician/songwriter in Germany, releasing several solo albums.\n\nWith the exception of a handful of senior college students who obviously had recourse to vinyl LP's and music trade papers, the rest of Sri Lanka's music enthusiasts had to rely on the occasional radio program such as \"Progressive 30\" presented by Mahes Perera to vaguely ascertain the evolving soundscape of the 70's or listening to the vinyl records at the British Council and the American Center.\n\nWhat was later to become \"Rock Company\" had its start around this time. The self same college students acquired guitars, drum kits, keyboards, hired rudimentary sound systems and started to hang out together and attempted to recreate the records of their heroes with differing levels of success.\n\nAll this without the aid of decent guitars, effects pedals, drum kits, synthesizers, sophisticated PA systems or recording studios! The first ever Rock events in Sri Lanka revolved around bands such as \"The Unwanted Generation\", \"Graveyard\" and \"Coffin Nail\" featuring such musicians as Prins Jayaratnam, Chris Dhasan, Nimal Gunawardena, Ramesh Weeratunga, Imtiaz Hameed and Kumar Navaratnam responsible for organizing extravagant rock concerts featuring multiple Sri Lankan bands who introduced Colombo's wide eyed and newly hatched youth culture to the underground sounds streaming in from the UK and the US. The \"Wall Band and Gun Chorus\" that centered on a well known neighbourhood hangout in Colombo 6 spawned a lot of the aforesaid musicians.\n\nA few years later, another important milestone was attained with the formation of \"Cancer,\" the first ever Sri Lankan band that took the initial step of composing and playing its own material. Led by Prasanna Abeysekera and his brother Ranil, together with a cast of musicians that included Brian Knower, Leo Pasquale, Sumedha Kulatunga and sundry other enthusiasts, \"Cancer\" defiantly rocked to a different beat.\n\nOne that they could truly call their own. However, the lack of recording facilities and a proper medium to spread the band's original output ensured that only a tiny handful would appreciate their attempts at creating a Sri Lankan rock identity.\n\n\"Cancer\" and their ilk, did find a regular hangout where they and like minded bands could rehearse and showcase their abilities to the true believers, within the suitably run down walls of \"Koko's, - the closest local equivalent to a rock venue located in Thimbirigasyaya.\n\nHard on the heels of \"Cancer\" came such luminaries as \"Rattlesnake\" and \"Venom\" who for the most part, played hard rock covers and helped to keep the music alive through the gigs that took place at \"Koko's and other venues. The late 70's saw a notable change in the rock scene with the emergence of a whole new generation of bands with a different agenda- Punk Rock and new wave bands and songwriters reintroduced high energy and a DIY work ethic that flew in the face of established mainstream acts throughout Europe and the US.\n\nLargely unaffected by these changes, Sri Lanka's Rock bands soldiered on until many of the pioneering musicians emigrated or found themselves with little or no time to pursue music as family and economic demands focused their attention away from power chords and heavy riffs. Rock Company itself wound to a close in the late 80's and the decade that followed saw the music being just about kept alive by a handful of devotees along with Rattlesnake, Venom, Cancer and Brass Face.\n\nSri Lanka now has a significant underground metal and hard rock community, which is growing in popularity among upper-middle-class teenagers and young adults. Some internationally known Sri Lankan metal bands include [[Stigmata (band)|Stigmata]], [[Paranoid Earthling]], [[Plecto aliquem capite|Plecto Aliquem Capite]]. Many other bands too have emerged ever since the 1990s making the heavy metal underground much bigger. While Colombo is a breeding ground for many hard rock bands like [[Stigmata (band)|Stigmata]], Kandy gave birth to the pioneer [[Grunge]] outfit [[Paranoid Earthling]], which was the first rock band to emerge from the Hill Capital. Kandy is also the stronghold for [[black metal]] bands like \"Forlorn Hope\" \"Pariah Demise\" \"Necro Horde\" \"Goatmunition\" and some doom metal bands as well.\n\n==References==\n{{portal|Sri Lanka|Music}}\n{{reflist}}\n[https://jayasrilanka.net/albums/artist-by-letters.php Old Sinhala Songs]\n\n==External links==\n{{Prone to spam|date=May 2015}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nDMOZ (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n* [http://www.mysrilanka.com/travel/lanka/art/music.htm Sri Lankan Music]\n\n{{Music of Asia}}\n{{Sinhala songs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Music Of Sri Lanka}}\n[[Category:Sri Lankan music| ]]\n", "name_user": "175.157.95.173", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Sri_Lanka"}

However, people born in Russia who weren't on the Russian territory when the law came into force, as well as some people born in the Soviet Union who lived in Russia but weren't formally domiciled there weren't granted Russian citizenship. When at December 31, 2003 former Soviet passports became invalid, those people overnight become foreigners, although many of them considered Russia their home. The majority were deprived their de facto status of Russian Federation nationals, they lost their right to remain in Russian Federation, they were even deprived of retirement benefits and medical assistance.

However, people born in Russia who weren't on the Russian territory when the law came into force, as well as some people born in the Soviet Union who lived in Russia but weren't formally domiciled there weren't granted Russian citizenship. When at December 31, 2003 former Soviet passports became invalid, those people overnight become foreigners, although many of them considered Russia their home. The majority were deprived their de facto status of Russian Federation nationals, they lost their right to remain in Russian Federation, they were even deprived of retirement benefits and medical assistance.
