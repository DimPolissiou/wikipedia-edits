It is possible she was [[insanity|insane]]. After the king died on 6&nbsp;November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the [[putrefaction]]. Eventually, the embarrassed chancellor, [[Axel Oxenstierna]], saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes.<ref>Peter Englund: ''S\u00f8lvmasken'' (s. 159), edited by Spartacus, Oslo 2009, {{ISBN|978-82-430-0466-5}}</ref> As a result, he was not buried until 22&nbsp;June 1634, more than eighteen months later.\n\nIn 1634, the [[Instrument of Government (1634)|Instrument of Government]], a new constitution, was introduced by Oxenstierna.

In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, [[Ebba Leijonhufvud]] and [[Christina Natt och Dag]] were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title ''Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska'' ('Castigation Mistress'), while [[Beata Oxenstierna]] and [[Ebba Ryning]] were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of ''Hovm\u00e4starinna''.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\">Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[File:Queenchristine.jpg|thumb|The 14-year-old Christina as queen, painting by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]]]]\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed any attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, such as [[Ebba Sparre]], [[Lady Jane Ruthven]] and [[Louise van der Nooth]], Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\"/>\n\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been. The theologian [[Johannes Matthiae Gothus]] became her tutor; he gave her lessons in [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed [[Tacitus]] with her. Oxenstierna wrote proudly of the 14-year-old girl that, \"She is not at all like a female\" and that she had \"a bright intelligence\". Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day.

He won several battles, and in 1631, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] decided France would support Sweden with money and soldiers. But Gustavus was killed in 1632.\n\nCount Oxenstierna became regent and continued Sweden's part in the war. Defeated in the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)]], the Swedish army retreated from southern Germany to [[Pomerania]]. Though Sweden won some later battles, the war effort was exhausting.\n\nChristina reached her majority in 1644, and Chancellor Oxenstierna soon discovered that her political views differed from his own. In 1645 he sent his son, [[Johan Oxenstierna]], to the Peace Congress in the [[Westphalia]]n cities of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], to argue against peace. Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, [[Johan Adler Salvius]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Westphalia]] was signed between May and October 1648, effectively ending the [[European wars of religion]]. Sweden received an indemnity of five million [[thaler]]s, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received [[Western Pomerania]] (henceforth [[Swedish Pomerania]]), [[Wismar]], the [[Archbishopric of Bremen]], and the [[Bishopric of Verden]] as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] and in the respective diets (''[[Kreistag]]'') of three [[Imperial Circles]]: the [[Upper Saxon Circle]], [[Lower Saxon Circle]], and [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]; the city of Bremen was disputed.<ref>B\u00f6hme, Klaus-R (2001).

Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called [[Academy of Arcadia]], where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet [[Reyer Anslo]] was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also [[Francesco Negri (travel writer)|Francesco Negri]], a Franciscan from [[Ravenna]] who is regarded as the first tourist to visit [[North Cape, Norway]].{{refn|group=note|Negri wrote eight letters about his walk through Scandinavia all the way up to \"Capo Nord\" in 1664.}} Another [[Franciscan]] was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina's confessor for eight years.{{refn|group=note|He too had been a pupil of Johannes Matthiae, and his uncle had been Gustav Adolf's teacher. As a diplomat in Portugal he had converted, and asked for a transfer to Rome when he learnt of Christina's arrival.}}\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One of them was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Decio Azzolino]], who had been a secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican's correspondence with European courts.<ref name=bargrave>''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals'' by [[John Bargrave]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] (reprint; 2009)</ref> He was also the leader of the ''[[Squadrone Volante]]'', the free thinking \"Flying Squad\" movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 157.</ref> to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this \"does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.\" As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved.{{refn|group=note|Christina wrote him many letters during her travels. After her death, Azzolino burnt most of their correspondence; about 80 have survived.

On one occasion the couple had arranged to meet at the [[Villa Medici]] near [[Monte Pincio]], but the cardinal did not show up. Christina hurried over to [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], firing one of the [[cannon]]s. The mark in the bronze gate in front of Villa Medici is still visible.<ref>Ola \u00c5modt: ''Roma \u2013 legender og merkverdigheter''</ref>--><!--Perhaps the most illustrious of the eminent figures befriended and patronized by Christina was the sculptor-architect-painter, [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], the greatest artistic genius of the century, to whom the queen showed the highest of personal honors by visiting his home-studio on more than one occasion. \"Whoever does not esteem Bernini is not worthy of esteem himself,\" she is quoted as saying by [[Domenico Bernini]] in his biography, ''The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.''<ref>Ed. and trans. by Franco Mormando, Penn State University Press, 2011, p. 175.

The French politician [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)|Neapolitan Republic]] was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] gave up. <!--Supported by the [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Duke of Modena]], Mazarin was now considering Christina as a possible queen for Naples.--> Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Gu\u00eames.<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 150.</ref> On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from [[Civitavecchia]] for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\n\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature\".<ref>''Memoirs of Mademoiselle de Montpensier''. H. Colburn, 1848. Page 48.</ref>\n\nChristina was treated with respect by the young [[Louis XIV]] and his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] \u2013 the wedding took place in 1660. But this was unknown to Christina, who sent different messengers to Mazarin to remind him of their plan.}}\n\nOn her way back Christina visited the beautiful and atheistic [[Ninon de l'Enclos]] in the convent at [[Lagny-sur-Marne]]. In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome. (The plague infested several regions including Naples, where 250,000 people died within two years.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3310102 | pmid=22260781 | doi=10.3201/eid1801.110597 | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Plague epidemic in the Kingdom of Naples, 1656-1658 | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | pages=186\u20138 | last1 = Scasciamacchia | first1 = S | last2 = Serrecchia | first2 = L | last3 = Giangrossi | first3 = L | last4 = Garofolo | first4 = G | last5 = Balestrucci | first5 = A | last6 = Sammartino | first6 = G | last7 = Fasanella | first7 = A| year=2012 }}</ref>) In July 1657 she returned to France, likely being impatient. It is not known where she stayed that summer. In Fontainebleau she was ordered by the court to halt. <!--In Madrid and Naples they seem to have had an idea about her plans; 3,000 soldiers are sent to the Kingdom of Naples and new fortifications appear along the coast?

He insisted that betrayal should be punished with death. She was convinced that he had pronounced his own death sentence. After an hour or so Le Bel was to receive his confession. Both Le Bel and Monaldeschi entreated for mercy, but he was stabbed by her domestics \u2013 notably Ludovico Santinelli \u2013 in his stomach and in his neck. Wearing his [[coat of mail]], which protected him, he was chased around in an adjacent room before they finally succeeded in dealing him a fatal wound in his throat. \"In the end, he died, confessing his infamy and admitting [Santinelli's] innocence, protesting that he had invented the whole fantastic story in order to ruin [him].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|title=Gribble, Francis (2013) The Court of Christina of Sweden, and the Later Adventures of the Queen in Exile, pp. 196\u20137.|accessdate=10 July 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428064942/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|archivedate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace of Fontainebleau 030.jpg|thumb|Galerie des Cerfs]]\n\nFather Le Bel was told to have him buried inside the church, and Christina, seemingly unfazed, paid an abbey to say a number of Masses for his soul.

In Rome, people felt differently; Monaldeschi had been an Italian nobleman, murdered by a foreign barbarian with Santinelli as one of her executioners. The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed. Christina never revealed what was in the letters, but according to Le Bel, it is supposed to have dealt about her \"amours\", either with Monaldeschi or another person.

His nephew, Pompeo Azzolino, was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina's art collections.\n\n==Art collector==\n\n[[File:Drottning Kristina av Sverige.jpg|thumb|left|Christina by [[David Beck]]]]\nUntil 1649, when Christina was twenty-three, the Swedish royal art collection was unimpressive, with good [[tapestries]] but for paintings, little more than \"about a hundred works by minor German, Flemish, and Swedish painters\".<ref>Watson, 97</ref>  But in May 1649 the fabulous loot from the [[Battle of Prague (1648)|occupation of Prague Castle]] the previous year arrived, with the pick of the collection amassed by the obsessive collector [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1552\u20131612), one of the most important in Europe.  Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517\u201386), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists\",<ref>Trevor-Roper, 112.</ref>\n\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.<ref>Watson, 97\u201398</ref>\n\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.<ref>Watson, 127\u20139</ref>\n\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.<ref>Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].</ref>  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,<ref>Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.</ref> and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.<ref>Grate</ref>\n\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.<ref>Watson, 160\u2013161; not all these attributions would hold today.</ref> [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.  ''Venus mourns Adonis'' by Veronese was from Prague, and is now back in Sweden ([[Nationalmuseum]]).\n\n[[File:Busto-ritratto di Cristina di Svezia - Cartari.jpg|thumb|Bust of Christina by [[Giulio Cartari]] in [[Palacio Real de La Granja de San Ildefonso]]]]\nChristina liked to commission portraits of herself, friends, and also notable people she had not met, from 1647 sending [[David Beck]], her Dutch court painter, to several countries to paint notabilities.<ref>Watson, 120\u2013121</ref>  She encouraged artists to study her collection, including the drawings, and exhibited some of her paintings, but apart from portraits she commissioned or bought few works by living painters, except for drawings.  Sculptors did rather better, and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] was a friend, while others were commissioned to restore the large collection of classical sculpture which she had begun to assemble while still in Sweden.<ref>Grate; Watson, 110, 142, 152\u2013162</ref>\n\nOn her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio [[Odescalchi]], commander of the Papal army,<ref>Watson,168\u20139; Odescalchi was the nephew of [[Pope Innocent XI]], though in fact his money was inherited and his career greatly improved after his uncle's death.</ref> at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian.<ref>Watson, 170; Penny 463 has different numbers, saying Crozat initially saw over 400 paintings.</ref>  The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector [[Pierre Crozat]], acting as intermediary for [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], from 1715 the Regent of France.  The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale delivered in 1721, forming the core of the [[Orleans Collection]], the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the [[French Revolution]], many still remaining in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Penny, 462\u20133, and [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_agony_in_the_garden/objectview.aspx?page=1&sort=0&sortdir=asc&keyword=Orleans&fp=1&dd1=11&dd2=0&vw=1&collID=11&OID=110001821&vT=1 Metropolitan]</ref>  The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings,<ref name=\"Penny, 462\">Penny, 462</ref> and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the [[Correggio]]s, implicating [[Carlo Maratti]].<ref>Watson, 196\u20137</ref>\n\nAt first, removing her collections  from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697 Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there.

In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, [[Ebba Leijonhufvud]] and [[Christina Natt och Dag]] were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title ''Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska'' ('Castigation Mistress'), while [[Beata Oxenstierna]] and [[Ebba Ryning]] were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of ''Hovm\u00e4starinna''.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\">Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[File:Queenchristine.jpg|thumb|The 14-year-old Christina as queen, painting by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]]]]\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed any attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, such as [[Ebba Sparre]], [[Lady Jane Ruthven]] and [[Louise van der Nooth]], Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\"/>\n\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been.

Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, [[Johan Adler Salvius]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Westphalia]] was signed between May and October 1648, effectively ending the [[European wars of religion]]. Sweden received an indemnity of five million [[thaler]]s, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received [[Western Pomerania]] (henceforth [[Swedish Pomerania]]), [[Wismar]], the [[Archbishopric of Bremen]], and the [[Bishopric of Verden]] as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] and in the respective diets (''[[Kreistag]]'') of three [[Imperial Circles]]: the [[Upper Saxon Circle]], [[Lower Saxon Circle]], and [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]; the city of Bremen was disputed.<ref>B\u00f6hme, Klaus-R (2001).

Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called [[Academy of Arcadia]], where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet [[Reyer Anslo]] was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also [[Francesco Negri (travel writer)|Francesco Negri]], a Franciscan from [[Ravenna]] who is regarded as the first tourist to visit [[North Cape, Norway]].{{refn|group=note|Negri wrote eight letters about his walk through Scandinavia all the way up to \"Capo Nord\" in 1664.}} Another [[Franciscan]] was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina's confessor for eight years.{{refn|group=note|He too had been a pupil of Johannes Matthiae, and his uncle had been Gustav Adolf's teacher. As a diplomat in Portugal he had converted, and asked for a transfer to Rome when he learnt of Christina's arrival.}}\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One of them was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Decio Azzolino]], who had been a secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican's correspondence with European courts.<ref name=bargrave>''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals'' by [[John Bargrave]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] (reprint; 2009)</ref> He was also the leader of the ''[[Squadrone Volante]]'', the free thinking \"Flying Squad\" movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 157.</ref> to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this \"does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.\" As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved.{{refn|group=note|Christina wrote him many letters during her travels.

On one occasion the couple had arranged to meet at the [[Villa Medici]] near [[Monte Pincio]], but the cardinal did not show up. Christina hurried over to [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], firing one of the [[cannon]]s.

The French politician [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)|Neapolitan Republic]] was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] gave up. <!--Supported by the [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Duke of Modena]], Mazarin was now considering Christina as a possible queen for Naples.--> Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Gu\u00eames.<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 150.</ref> On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from [[Civitavecchia]] for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\n\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature\".<ref>''Memoirs of Mademoiselle de Montpensier''. H. Colburn, 1848. Page 48.</ref>\n\nChristina was treated with respect by the young [[Louis XIV]] and his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] \u2013 the wedding took place in 1660. But this was unknown to Christina, who sent different messengers to Mazarin to remind him of their plan.}}\n\nOn her way back Christina visited the beautiful and atheistic [[Ninon de l'Enclos]] in the convent at [[Lagny-sur-Marne]]. In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome. (The plague infested several regions including Naples, where 250,000 people died within two years.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3310102 | pmid=22260781 | doi=10.3201/eid1801.110597 | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Plague epidemic in the Kingdom of Naples, 1656-1658 | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | pages=186\u20138 | last1 = Scasciamacchia | first1 = S | last2 = Serrecchia | first2 = L | last3 = Giangrossi | first3 = L | last4 = Garofolo | first4 = G | last5 = Balestrucci | first5 = A | last6 = Sammartino | first6 = G | last7 = Fasanella | first7 = A| year=2012 }}</ref>) In July 1657 she returned to France, likely being impatient. It is not known where she stayed that summer. In Fontainebleau she was ordered by the court to halt. <!--In Madrid and Naples they seem to have had an idea about her plans; 3,000 soldiers are sent to the Kingdom of Naples and new fortifications appear along the coast?

He insisted that betrayal should be punished with death. She was convinced that he had pronounced his own death sentence. After an hour or so Le Bel was to receive his confession. Both Le Bel and Monaldeschi entreated for mercy, but he was stabbed by her domestics \u2013 notably Ludovico Santinelli \u2013 in his stomach and in his neck. Wearing his [[coat of mail]], which protected him, he was chased around in an adjacent room before they finally succeeded in dealing him a fatal wound in his throat. \"In the end, he died, confessing his infamy and admitting [Santinelli's] innocence, protesting that he had invented the whole fantastic story in order to ruin [him].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|title=Gribble, Francis (2013) The Court of Christina of Sweden, and the Later Adventures of the Queen in Exile, pp. 196\u20137.|accessdate=10 July 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428064942/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|archivedate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace of Fontainebleau 030.jpg|thumb|Galerie des Cerfs]]\n\nFather Le Bel was told to have him buried inside the church, and Christina, seemingly unfazed, paid an abbey to say a number of Masses for his soul.

In Rome, people felt differently; Monaldeschi had been an Italian nobleman, murdered by a foreign barbarian with Santinelli as one of her executioners. The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed. Christina never revealed what was in the letters, but according to Le Bel, it is supposed to have dealt about her \"amours\", either with Monaldeschi or another person.

He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decollet\u00e9 dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace.

His nephew, Pompeo Azzolino, was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina's art collections.\n\n==Art collector==\n\n[[File:Drottning Kristina av Sverige.jpg|thumb|left|Christina by [[David Beck]]]]\nUntil 1649, when Christina was twenty-three, the Swedish royal art collection was unimpressive, with good [[tapestries]] but for paintings, little more than \"about a hundred works by minor German, Flemish, and Swedish painters\".<ref>Watson, 97</ref>  But in May 1649 the fabulous loot from the [[Battle of Prague (1648)|occupation of Prague Castle]] the previous year arrived, with the pick of the collection amassed by the obsessive collector [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1552\u20131612), one of the most important in Europe.  Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517\u201386), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists\",<ref>Trevor-Roper, 112.</ref>\n\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.<ref>Watson, 97\u201398</ref>\n\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.<ref>Watson, 127\u20139</ref>\n\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.<ref>Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].</ref>  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,<ref>Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.</ref> and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.<ref>Grate</ref>\n\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.<ref>Watson, 160\u2013161; not all these attributions would hold today.</ref> [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.  ''Venus mourns Adonis'' by Veronese was from Prague, and is now back in Sweden ([[Nationalmuseum]]).\n\n[[File:Busto-ritratto di Cristina di Svezia - Cartari.jpg|thumb|Bust of Christina by [[Giulio Cartari]] in [[Palacio Real de La Granja de San Ildefonso]]]]\nChristina liked to commission portraits of herself, friends, and also notable people she had not met, from 1647 sending [[David Beck]], her Dutch court painter, to several countries to paint notabilities.<ref>Watson, 120\u2013121</ref>  She encouraged artists to study her collection, including the drawings, and exhibited some of her paintings, but apart from portraits she commissioned or bought few works by living painters, except for drawings.  Sculptors did rather better, and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] was a friend, while others were commissioned to restore the large collection of classical sculpture which she had begun to assemble while still in Sweden.<ref>Grate; Watson, 110, 142, 152\u2013162</ref>\n\nOn her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio [[Odescalchi]], commander of the Papal army,<ref>Watson,168\u20139; Odescalchi was the nephew of [[Pope Innocent XI]], though in fact his money was inherited and his career greatly improved after his uncle's death.</ref> at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian.<ref>Watson, 170; Penny 463 has different numbers, saying Crozat initially saw over 400 paintings.</ref>  The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector [[Pierre Crozat]], acting as intermediary for [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], from 1715 the Regent of France.  The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale delivered in 1721, forming the core of the [[Orleans Collection]], the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the [[French Revolution]], many still remaining in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Penny, 462\u20133, and [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_agony_in_the_garden/objectview.aspx?page=1&sort=0&sortdir=asc&keyword=Orleans&fp=1&dd1=11&dd2=0&vw=1&collID=11&OID=110001821&vT=1 Metropolitan]</ref>  The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings,<ref name=\"Penny, 462\">Penny, 462</ref> and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the [[Correggio]]s, implicating [[Carlo Maratti]].<ref>Watson, 196\u20137</ref>\n\nAt first, removing her collections  from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697 Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there.

Stated differently, you may open carry an assault weapon/shotgun with more than 7 rounds with a permit in the aforementioned locations, but do not need a permit to do so in any other locality in Virginia.\n\n\nIn a vehicle, a firearm may be considered \"openly carried\" if the firearm is openly visible, though this is not as well established as the \"secured in a container/compartment\" rule mentioned above.\n|-\n| State preemption of local restrictions? || Yes || Yes || [https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter9/section15.2-915/ \u00a7 15.2-915]  \n| Virginia has state preemption for most but not all firearm laws.\n|-\n| Assault weapon law? || Yes  || Yes ||  [https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-308.2:2/ \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2]<br>\n[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-308.2:01/ \u00a7 18.2-308.2:01]\n[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-308.7/ \u00a7 18.2-308.7]\n|| Proof of age (18+ for long arms, 21+ for pistols) and proof of citizenship (or permanent residence license) are required for the purchase of \"assault weapons\". \"Assault weapons\" are defined as a semi-automatic, centerfire, firearm equipped with a folding stock, or equipped at the time with a magazine capable of holding more than 20 rounds, or capable of accommodating a silencer/suppressor.\n|-\n| Magazine restriction? || No || No ||  [https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-287.4/ \u00a7 18.2-287.4]<br>\n[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-282/ \u00a7 18.2-282.]\n|| Magazines capable of holding more than 20 rounds are legal but, they make the firearm an \"assault weapon\", subject to law accordingly.\n|-\n| [[National Firearms Act|NFA]] weapons restricted? || No || No ||  [https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-308.8/ \u00a7 18.2-308.8]<br>[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-308.5/ \u00a7 18.2-308.5]<br>[https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-295/ \u00a7 18.2-295]\n|| Fully automatic firearms (machine guns) must be registered with the state police.

The bills included the following provisions:\n* Criminal background checks are now required for all gun sales, excluding sales between family members and under certain other circumstances. Private party transfers between individuals who do not have a pre-existing relationship now require a background check conducted at a gun store.\n* Handgun purchases are now capped at 1 every 30 days. However, people with licenses to carry concealed pistols are excluded from this limit. \n* Virginia now has a \"Red Flag Law.\" This means that judges can temporarily order the seizure of firearms from persons who are deemed a threat to themselves or others. \n* Local governments have expanded power to ban firearms in certain sensitive areas, such as government buildings and public events. \n* The penalty for allowing a child under 14 years of age to possess a firearms by leaving is unsecured in a reckless fashion was increased from a Class 3 misdemeanor to a Class 1 misdemeanor. \n* People subject to \"permanent protective orders\" (domestic violence restraining orders with a maximum duration of 2 years) are required to surrender their firearms to local law enforcement, sell them to a licensed dealer, or give them to a person who is not prohibited from possessing firearms within 24 hours of being served notice of the protective order. \n* Gun owners must report lost or stolen firearms to police within 48 hours. \nMost notably, an \"assault weapons\" ban that was pushed by Virginia Governor Northam did not pass after significant protest by gun-rights advocates. \n<ref>https://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/history-making-batch-of-gun-control-bills-moves-from-legislature/article_e420dde0-ca59-59ca-b4cb-9cc40f222bb7.html</ref> <ref>https://wset.com/news/at-the-capitol/seven-gun-bills-pass-virginia-house-including-red-flag-law</ref>\n\n==Concealed carry reciprocity==\nVA code [https://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2014/title-18.2/section-18.2-308.014/ 18.2-308.014 (reciprocity)] states:\n\n{{quote|A valid concealed handgun or concealed weapon permit or license issued by another state shall authorize the holder of such permit or license who is at least 21 years of age to carry a concealed handgun in the Commonwealth, provided\n\n(i) the issuing authority provides the means for instantaneous verification of the validity of all such permits or licenses issued within that state, accessible 24 hours a day if available;\n\n(ii) the permit or license holder carries a photo identification issued by a government agency of any state or by the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. Department of State and displays the permit or license and such identification upon demand by a law-enforcement officer; and\n\n(iii) the permit or license holder has not previously had a Virginia concealed handgun permit revoked.}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Law of Virginia]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/ \"Crimes Involving Health and Safety\"].

It was built in competition to another bridge, the Babu Khar bridge, only three miles (4.8&nbsp;km) away, and was clearly built to raise taxes from travellers. The castle is said to have been the first castle built in the country. The ruins of the castle and also the remains of extensive fields and watercourses are still visible. Lha chen Naglug also built the palace at Wanla.<ref>Francke (1977), pp. 80, 92.</ref>\n\nThere are a number of ancient Dardic rock carvings nearby, including one of a Dard woman carrying a basket on her back, one of a man hunting antelopes, and some showing men with what appear to be flat hats, all costumes similar to the Dards of [[Dah Hanu|Da]]. In front of the ancient Dard castle at Khalatse is an inscription in an Indian language which probably dates from the period of Dard occupation.<ref>Francke (1977), pp. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\nThe German [[Moravian Church]] Mission, which opened in Leh in 1885 had a sub-station in Khalatse which remained open for the half a century prior to India's independence in 1947 and played a prominent role there with their medical and educational activities, but only made a few converts.<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 212.</ref>\n\nEntering Khaltse by the road from Srinigar, it is clear one is entering the heartland of Buddhism with its ''chortens'' or small [[stupas]], [[mani stone]]s and [[prayer flag]]s. Upstream from Khalatse, and downstream on the right bank of the Indus, the people are almost all Buddhist. The ones downstream are mostly Brokpa or Dards.<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 203.</ref>  Khalatse is also famous for its [[apricots]].<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 23.</ref>\n\nBecause Khalatse is about 400 metres lower than Leh, two crops can be grown each year rather than only one. By the time crops are being sown at Leh in late May, they are already half-grown at Khalatse. The first crop&nbsp;\u2013 usually of ''grim'' (naked [[barley]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Hordeum vulgare'' L. var. ''nudum'' Hook. f., which is an ancient form of domesticated barley with an easier to remove hull)&nbsp;\u2013 from which [[tsampa]], the staple food in Ladakh, is made) is usually harvested by mid-July and then other crops such as [[buckwheat]], [[turnips]] and other vegetables are planted.<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 38.</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India]], Khaltse has 156 households.

It was built in competition to another bridge, the Babu Khar bridge, only three miles (4.8&nbsp;km) away, and was clearly built to raise taxes from travellers. The castle is said to have been the first castle built in the country. The ruins of the castle and also the remains of extensive fields and watercourses are still visible. Lha chen Naglug also built the palace at Wanla.<ref>Francke (1977), pp. 80, 92.</ref>\n\nThere are a number of ancient Dardic rock carvings nearby, including one of a Dard woman carrying a basket on her back, one of a man hunting antelopes, and some showing men with what appear to be flat hats, all costumes similar to the Dards of [[Dah Hanu|Da]]. In front of the ancient Dard castle at Khalatse is an inscription in an Indian language which probably dates from the period of Dard occupation.<ref>Francke (1977), pp. 71\u201372.</ref>\n\nThe German [[Moravian Church]] Mission, which opened in Leh in 1885 had a sub-station in Khalatse which remained open for the half a century prior to India's independence in 1947 and played a prominent role there with their medical and educational activities, but only made a few converts.<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 212.</ref>\n\nEntering Khaltse by the road from Srinigar, it is clear one is entering the heartland of Buddhism with its ''chortens'' or small [[stupas]], [[mani stone]]s and [[prayer flag]]s. Upstream from Khalatse, and downstream on the right bank of the Indus, the people are almost all Buddhist. The ones downstream are mostly Brokpa or Dards.<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 203.</ref>  Khalatse is also famous for its [[apricots]].<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 23.</ref>\n\nBecause Khalatse is about 400 metres lower than Leh, two crops can be grown each year rather than only one. By the time crops are being sown at Leh in late May, they are already half-grown at Khalatse. The first crop&nbsp;\u2013 usually of ''grim'' (naked [[barley]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Hordeum vulgare'' L. var. ''nudum'' Hook. f., which is an ancient form of domesticated barley with an easier to remove hull)&nbsp;\u2013 from which [[tsampa]], the staple food in Ladakh, is made) is usually harvested by mid-July and then other crops such as [[buckwheat]], [[turnips]] and other vegetables are planted.<ref>Rizvi (1996), p. 38.</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India]], Khaltse has 156 households.
