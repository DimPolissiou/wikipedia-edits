At the present time, the Black Russian Terrier is a breed recognized by the FCI ([[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale|FCI's]] from September 1983), AKC ([[American Kennel Club|AKC's]] from July 2004), CKC, KC, ANKC, NZKC and other [[Cynology|cynological]] organizations. The contemporary Black Russian Terrier is a working dog, guarding dog, sporting and companion dog.\n\nDespite its name, the Black Russian Terrier is not a true [[terrier]]: it is believed that about seventeen breeds were used in its development, including the [[Airedale Terrier|Airedale]], the [[Giant Schnauzer]], the [[Rottweiler]], the [[Newfoundland dog|Newfoundland]], the [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]] and other breeds.\n\n==History==\nThe Black Russian Terrier was developed in the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel by the state for use as a military/working dogs. The breeding stock was largely imported from countries where the Red Army was active during the [[Second World War]], especially [[East Germany]]. Breeds used in the development include the [[Giant Schnauzer]], [[Airedale Terrier]], [[Rottweiler]], [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]] and other breeds. BRT were bred for working ability, rather than appearance, and early examples only resembled today's Black Russian Terrier in their build and coat type. The BRT was bred solely by the state owned [[Red Star Kennel]] in Moscow until 1957, when some puppies were sold to civilian breeders. These breeders began to breed for looks (as the original was rather plain) while retaining working ability. In time, the breed spread to the other parts of [[Soviet Union|USSR]] like [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Siberia]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] and later to the first European country [[Finland]] and next to the other European countries: [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]] and finally to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and others.\n\nIn 1955 the first working examples of the breed were put on show at an exhibition in Moscow and the first Breed Standard was published in 1958,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedogscene.co.uk/dog-breeds/russian-black-terrier/|title=The Dog Scene: Russian Black Terrier|website=www.thedogscene.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-26}}</ref> which was then adopted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=5181|title=The Kennel Club|access-date=2016-11-26}}</ref> In 1996 The Russian Federation Working Dog-breeders & Russian Kynological Federation (RKF) adopted a second Standard for the breed more in line to the modern day Russian Black Terrier. And it was also in 1996 that the breed was first introduced into the UK. In 1998 [[The Kennel Club]] added the Russian Black Terrier to the Import Register.\n\n== Description ==\n\n===Coat===\nThe coat is a double coat with a coarse outer guard hair over a softer undercoat. The coat is hard and dense, never soft, woolly, silky or frizzy. It should be trimmed to between 5 and 15&nbsp;cm (2-6&nbsp;inches)<ref name=\"FCI\">{{cite web|title=FCI-Standard N\u00b0 327 |url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/327g02-en.pdf| date=10 January 2011 |website=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale| |format=PDF| accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref> in length. It should form a beard and eyebrows on the face, and a slight mane around the withers and neck that is more pronounced in males. The coat is low-shedding and the colour is black or black with some scattered gray hairs.\n\n===Size===\nAccording to the FCI standard<ref name=\"FCI\"/> the male stands 72 to 76&nbsp;cm and not more than 78&nbsp;cm at the withers compared to the female's 68\u201372&nbsp;cm and not more than 74&nbsp;cm. The male weighs between 50 and 60&nbsp;kg (110-132&nbsp;lbs), and the females weigh between 45 and 50&nbsp;kg (99-110&nbsp;lbs). Nowadays, even larger individuals are tolerated if the dog is well proportioned and retains correct movements.\n\nAt maturity (over 18 months of age), the AKC standard<ref name=\"AKC\">{{cite web|title=Black Russian Terrier standard|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/black_russian_terrier/|publisher=AKC}}</ref> recommends 27-30&nbsp;inches for males with the desired height between 27 and 29&nbsp;inches and 26 and 29&nbsp;inches for females with the desired height between 26 and 28&nbsp;inches. A mature male less than 27&nbsp;inches or more than 30&nbsp;inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. A mature female less than 26&nbsp;inches or more than 29&nbsp;inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. Although the standard also states \"Height consideration should not outweigh that of type, proportion, movement and other functional attributes.\" In proportions, a Black Russian Terrier should be slightly longer than tall, a ratio of 9 \u00bd to 10 being ideal.<ref name=\"AKC\"/>\n\n===Temperament===\nThe character and temperament of the Black Russian Terrier is of utmost importance. The Black Russian Terrier is a calm, confident, courageous and self-assured dog, although they can also be stubborn and lazy. He is highly intelligent and adapts well to training. The Black Russian Terrier was initially bred to guard and protect. He is alert and responsive, instinctively protective, determined, fearless, deeply loyal to family, is aloof and therefore does not relish intrusion by strangers into his personal space. Shyness or excessive excitability is a serious fault.\nIf you have a family with children, the Black Russian Terrier is a great fit for it. They are great companions for children since they have a strong guarding instinct towards children. Female Black Russian Terriers have more patience and will to play with children, but both sexes get incredibly well kids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worlddogfinder.com/blog/dog-breeds/meet-the-black-pearl-of-russia-black-russian-terrier|title=Meet the Black Pearl of Russia - Black Russian Terrier|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n[[Image:Black Russian Terrier carting.jpg|thumb|BRTs have traditionally been used for a wide variety of tasks, such as [[carting]]]]\n\n==Care==\nThe Black Russian Terrier, because of its breeding as a working dog, has a very strong \"work ethic\", and needs a job to do in order to be happy. Early training is a must and they are very responsive to firm, consistent training, excelling at [[Obedience trial|Obedience]] competitions. They also perform well in other dog sports, such as [[Dog agility|Agility]], and [[Schutzhund]] training. \nThey have a low-shedding coat, and need grooming several times a week. Dogs who compete in conformation need to be groomed a minimum of every three weeks to keep the coat in show condition. This breed forms a strong bond with a single person and will not thrive if sent to boarding facilities. The young Black Russian Terrier needs lots of exercise, and may become [[hyperactive]] and destructive if it does not have a chance to burn off its energy. Once the dog has reached maturity their energy level decreases dramatically and they are most content laying near their owner.\n\n==Health==\nThe Black Russian Terrier is a generally healthy and somewhat long-lived dog (lifespan of 9\u201314 years), however it is prone to certain [[Genetic disorder|hereditary diseases]]:\n\nMajor concerns:<ref name=CHIC>{{cite web |title=Black Russian Terrier |url=http://www.caninehealthinfo.org/brdreqs.html?breed=BRU |publisher=Canine Health Information Centre |accessdate=19 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034711/http://www.caninehealthinfo.org/brdreqs.html?breed=BRU |archivedate=29 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n* [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]]\n* [[Elbow dysplasia]]\n* [[Hyperuricosuria]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Canine Hyperuricurosia|url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/Hyperuricosuria.php|publisher=Veterinary Genetics Laboratory}}</ref>\n* Juvenile [[laryngeal paralysis]] and [[Polyneuropathy in dogs and cats|polyneuropathy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Juvenile Laryngeal Paralysis & Polyneuropathy (JLPP) in Black Russian Terriers|url=http://www.caninegeneticdiseases.net/JLPP/|website=Canine Genetic Diseases Network |accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nMinor concerns\n\n* [[Hypertrophic osteodystrophy|Hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD)]] - a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies;\n* [[Panosteitis|Panosteitis (Pano or Wandering Lameness)]] - a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies;\n* Heart Disease - the most common heart problems are aortic stenosis, mitral valve dysplasia, cardiomyopathy;\n* Eyes Disease - the most common eyes problems are [[ectropion]], [[entropion]], [[conjunctivitis]];\n* Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Black Russian Terrier is no exception.

Unlike prokaryotic genomes, eukaryotic genomes were largely complex and inconsistent. It was soon accepted that 94% of human genes are interrupted, and 50% of hereditary diseases are involved in splicing intron errors out of interrupted genes.<ref name=\":1\" /> The best known example of a disease caused by a splicing error is [[Beta-thalassemia]], in which extra intronic material is erroneously spliced into the gene for making [[hemoglobin]].\n\n== Prokaryotes ==\nUnlike eukaryotes, [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] have a less complex genome. The structure of prokaryotic genomes contain fewer to none regions of introns and have longer continuous lines of exons, or uninterrupted regions.<ref name=\":0\" /> In other words, they contain more regions of DNA that are expressed. The idea that genome density decreases as the complexity of the organism increases hold true. This is due to the fact that eukaryotes have a much stronger presence of introns than prokaryotes. For example, prokaryotes contain about 1000 genes/Mb while humans contain about 6 genes/Mb.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson, James D., 1928-|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/839779760|title=Molecular biology of the gene|date=cop. 2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-85149-8|oclc=839779760}}</ref> Another example are lower [[Eukaryote|eukaryotes]], such as [[yeast]], that have many uninterrupted regions. However, this does not mean that these sections are fully uninterrupted, as [[tRNA]] synthesis requires excision of a nucleotide sequence, followed by [[RNA ligase (ATP)|ligation]].\n\nMost bacteria have some interruption of some genes.  Interrupted genes are universal in eukaryotes; yeasts may display single interruptions of a minority of genes, while in higher organisms most genes are interrupted.  Some eukaryotes may contain multiple interruptions with introns that can be longer than exons.

Roberts]] and [[Phillip Allen Sharp|Phillip A.

Unlike prokaryotic genomes, eukaryotic genomes were largely complex and inconsistent. It was soon accepted that 94% of human genes are interrupted, and 50% of hereditary diseases are involved in splicing intron errors out of interrupted genes.<ref name=\":1\" /> The best known example of a disease caused by a splicing error is [[Beta-thalassemia]], in which extra intronic material is erroneously spliced into the gene for making [[hemoglobin]].\n\n== Prokaryotes ==\nUnlike eukaryotes, [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] have a less complex genome. The structure of prokaryotic genomes contain fewer to none regions of introns and have longer continuous lines of exons, or uninterrupted regions.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Sharp|first=Phillip A.|date=2005-06-01|title=The discovery of split genes and RNA splicing|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/biochemical-sciences/abstract/S0968-0004(05)00092-7|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|language=English|volume=30|issue=6|pages=279\u2013281|doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2005.04.002|issn=0968-0004|pmid=15950867}}</ref> In other words, they contain more regions of DNA that are expressed. The idea that genome density decreases as the complexity of the organism increases hold true. This is due to the fact that eukaryotes have a much stronger presence of introns than prokaryotes. For example, prokaryotes contain about 1000 genes/Mb while humans contain about 6 genes/Mb.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson, James D., 1928-|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/839779760|title=Molecular biology of the gene|date=cop. 2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-85149-8|oclc=839779760}}</ref> Another example are lower [[Eukaryote|eukaryotes]], such as [[yeast]], that have many uninterrupted regions. However, this does not mean that these sections are fully uninterrupted, as [[tRNA]] synthesis requires excision of a nucleotide sequence, followed by [[RNA ligase (ATP)|ligation]].\n\nMost bacteria have some interruption of some genes.  Interrupted genes are universal in eukaryotes; yeasts may display single interruptions of a minority of genes, while in higher organisms most genes are interrupted.  Some eukaryotes may contain multiple interruptions with introns that can be longer than exons.  Introns are well-conserved across evolutionary history, suggesting their structure has some importance for the organism. They are longer in advanced organisms (higher plants and animals).

The seat of the institution remained undecided over years; while the prince initially favored [[Koblenz]], the cities of [[Aachen]], [[Bonn]], [[Cologne]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] also applied, with Aachen and Cologne being the main competitors. Aachen finally won with a financing concept backed by the insurance company and by local banks.<ref>[http://www.archiv.rwth-aachen.de/rea/Seite/geschichte_18.htm \"Geschichte der RWTH Aachen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403075440/http://www.archiv.rwth-aachen.de/rea/Seite/geschichte_18.htm |date=2009-04-03 }}, archives of RWTH Aachen university ''(German; retrieved 2009-04-11)''</ref> [[Groundbreaking]] for the new ''Polytechnikum'' took place on 15 May 1865 and [[lectures]] started during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] on 10 October 1870 with 223 [[students]] and 32 teachers. The new institution had as its primary purpose the education of engineers, especially for the mining industry in the [[Ruhr area]]; there were schools of [[chemistry]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[mechanical engineering]] as well as an introductory ''general school'' that taught [[mathematics]] and [[natural sciences]] and some [[social sciences]].\n\n[[File:RWTH Aachen Hauptgeb\u00e4ude.jpg|thumbnail|Main Building of the RWTH Aachen. It was built in 1870.]]\nThe unclear position of the new Prussian ''polytechnika'' (which officially were not [[universities]]) affected the first years. Polytechnics lacked prestige in society and the number of students decreased. This began to change in 1880 when the early RWTH, amongst others, was reorganized as a ''Royal Technical University'', gained a seat in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] and finally won the right to bestow [[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]] (1899) degrees and [[Diplom|Dipl.-Ing.]] titles (introduced in 1902). In the same year, over 800 male students enrolled. In 1909 the first women were admitted and the artist [[August von Brandis]] succeeded Alexander Frenz at the Faculty of Architecture as a \"professor of figure and landscape painting\", Brandis became dean in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spurensuche-ausstellung.de/brandis.php|title=Spurensuche Ausstellung > Brandis|work=spurensuche-ausstellung.de}}</ref>\n\n[[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], however, proved a serious setback for the university. Many students voluntarily joined up and died in the war, and parts of the university were shortly occupied or confiscated.\n\nWhile the (then no more royal) ''TH Aachen'' (Technische Hochschule Aachen) flourished in the 1920s with the introduction of more independent [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], of several new institutes and of the [[AStA|general students' committee]], the first signs of [[nationalist]] radicalization also became visible within the university. The [[Third Reich]]'s [[Gleichschaltung]] of the TH in 1933 met with relatively low resistance from both students and faculty. Beginning in September 1933, [[Jewish]] and (alleged) [[Communist]] professors (and from 1937 on also students) were systematically [[Antisemitism in Germany|persecuted]] and excluded from the university. Vacant [[Professor|Chairs]] were increasingly given to [[NSDAP]] party-members or sympathizers.<ref>[http://www.archiv.rwth-aachen.de/rea/Seite/geschichte_45.htm \"Geschichte der RWTH Aachen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521125116/http://www.archiv.rwth-aachen.de/rea/Seite/geschichte_45.htm |date=2009-05-21 }}, archives of RWTH Aachen university ''(German; retrieved 2009-04-11)''</ref> The freedom of research and teaching became severely limited, and institutes important for the regime's plans were systematically established,{{by whom|date=October 2015}} and existing chairs promoted. Briefly closed in 1939, the TH continued courses in 1940, although with a low number of students. On 21 October 1944, when Aachen [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulated]], more than 70% of all buildings of the university were destroyed or heavily damaged.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] ended in 1945 the university recovered and expanded quickly. In the 1950s, many professors who had been removed because of their alleged affiliation with the [[Nazi party]] were allowed to return and a multitude of new institutes were founded. By the late 1960s, the TH had 10,000 students, making it the foremost of all German technical universities. With the foundation of [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[medicine|medical]] faculties in 1965 and 1966, respectively, the university became more \"universal\". The newly founded faculties in particular began attracting new students, and the number of students almost doubled twice from 1970 (10,000) to 1980 (more than 25,000) and from 1980 to 1990 (more than 37,000).<ref name=\"RWTH &ndash; Facts &amp; Figures, p. 13\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/Die-RWTH/Profil/~enw/Daten-Fakten/?lidx=1|title=Facts and Figures \u2013 RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY \u2013 English|first=RWTH Aachen|last=University|website=www.rwth-aachen.de}}</ref> Now, the average number of students is around 42,000, with about one third of all students being women.

The new institution had as its primary purpose the education of engineers, especially for the mining industry in the [[Ruhr area]]; there were schools of [[chemistry]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[mechanical engineering]] as well as an introductory ''general school'' that taught [[mathematics]] and [[natural sciences]] and some [[social sciences]].\n\n[[File:RWTH Aachen Hauptgeb\u00e4ude.jpg|thumbnail|Main Building of the RWTH Aachen. It was built in 1870.]]\nThe unclear position of the new Prussian ''polytechnika'' (which officially were not [[universities]]) affected the first years. Polytechnics lacked prestige in society and the number of students decreased. This began to change in 1880 when the early RWTH, amongst others, was reorganized as a ''Royal Technical University'', gained a seat in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] and finally won the right to bestow [[Doktoringenieur|Dr.-Ing.]] (1899) degrees and [[Diplom|Dipl.-Ing.]] titles (introduced in 1902). In the same year, over 800 male students enrolled. In 1909 the first women were admitted and the artist [[August von Brandis]] succeeded Alexander Frenz at the Faculty of Architecture as a \"professor of figure and landscape painting\", Brandis became dean in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spurensuche-ausstellung.de/brandis.php|title=Spurensuche Ausstellung > Brandis|work=spurensuche-ausstellung.de}}</ref>\n\n[[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], however, proved a serious setback for the university. Many students voluntarily joined up and died in the war, and parts of the university were shortly occupied or confiscated.\n\nWhile the (then no more royal) ''TH Aachen'' (Technische Hochschule Aachen) flourished in the 1920s with the introduction of more independent [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], of several new institutes and of the [[AStA|general students' committee]], the first signs of [[nationalist]] radicalization also became visible within the university. The [[Third Reich]]'s [[Gleichschaltung]] of the TH in 1933 met with relatively low resistance from both students and faculty. Beginning in September 1933, [[Jewish]] and (alleged) [[Communist]] professors (and from 1937 on also students) were systematically [[Antisemitism in Germany|persecuted]] and excluded from the university. Vacant [[Professor|Chairs]] were increasingly given to [[NSDAP]] party-members or sympathizers.<ref>[http://www.archiv.rwth-aachen.de/rea/Seite/geschichte_45.htm \"Geschichte der RWTH Aachen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521125116/http://www.archiv.rwth-aachen.de/rea/Seite/geschichte_45.htm |date=2009-05-21 }}, archives of RWTH Aachen university ''(German; retrieved 2009-04-11)''</ref> The freedom of research and teaching became severely limited, and institutes important for the regime's plans were systematically established,{{by whom|date=October 2015}} and existing chairs promoted.

In the 1950s, many professors who had been removed because of their alleged affiliation with the [[Nazi party]] were allowed to return and a multitude of new institutes were founded. By the late 1960s, the TH had 10,000 students, making it the foremost of all German technical universities. With the foundation of [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[medicine|medical]] faculties in 1965 and 1966, respectively, the university became more \"universal\".

The following year saw the birth of the International Confederation of Students (ICS), which held a congress in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. Several delegations took part and the movement was launched. From 1925 to 1939, many great sporting events were organized by the students and the ICS: in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1925, [[Rome]], [[Italy]] in 1927, then again in Paris, [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] (1930), [[Turin]], [[Italy]] (1933), [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (1935), Paris (1937) and [[Monaco]] (1939). The [[World War II|Second World War]] interrupted these meetings, but when peace was restored, France re-launched the World University Games.\n\nThe peace was relative, and the shadow of the [[Cold War]] soon divided university sport. In 1946, the International Students Union (ISU) was created in Prague to pursue the works of the International Confederation of Students, and it organised the 9th World University Games in 1947. After those games, the increasing politicisation of the ISU led to a division within the university sports movement. In 1948, the International University Sports Federation (FISU) was created under the impetus of Paul Schleimer of [[Luxembourg]], and it launched the International University Sport Weeks in 1949 in [[Meran]], Italy. Other editions followed: in Luxembourg (1951), [[Dortmund]] (1953) and [[Donostia|San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (1955). In 1957, the French federation organised a World University Sports Championship which brought together students from the Eastern and Western blocks. From this meet arose the desire to organise a universal event in which students from all over the world could participate.\n\nIn 1959, FISU and the ISU agreed to participate in the games organised in Turin, Italy, by CUSI, the Italian Student Sports Association. That year was undoubtedly the one that left the biggest impression on our federation. In fact, the Italian organisers baptised these 1959 games 'Universiade'. They created the flag with a 'U' surrounded by stars, which was to begin its journey around the world, and replaced the national anthems at the medal-awarding ceremonies with [[Gaudeamus Igitur]]. The Universiade in Turin was a success for the local Executive Committee, as well as for the man who was to change the future of the university sports movement: Dr. [[Primo Nebiolo]]. During this Universiade, which brought together 43 countries and 1,400 participants, many non-member federations applied to become members of FISU.\n\nHowever, even though university sport was developing in a peaceful environment, the [[modus vivendi]] still needed to be established. In addition to the agreement that had been made concerning national symbols (neither flags nor anthems) and the programme, FISU defined its philosophy in article 2 of its statutes by stipulating: 'FISU pursues its objects without consideration or discrimination of a political, denominational or racial nature'. From then on, FISU was to organise the games at worldwide level.<ref>[http://www.fisu.net/medias/fichiers/FISU_Statutes_2009_English_Version.pdf FISU Statutes] Retrieved 2016-01-19.</ref>\n\nEver since this important period, the Universiades have continued to attract more and more participants. Starting with a total of 1,407 participants in Turin, Italy, in 1959, FISU reached a total of 6,757 participants from more than 165 countries in Beijing, China, in 2001, and 6,643 participants from 174 countries in Daegu, Korea, in 2003. The highest number of participants was registered at the 2013 Summer Universiade in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]], i.e. 11,759 representing 159 countries.\n\nThe Winter Universiades have experienced the same success. In fact, statistics show that 98 athletes participated in the games in [[Zell am See]], [[Austria]], in 1958, while a record of 2,668 participants from 52 countries came to the Winter Universiade in [[Trentino]], Italy, in 2013. The expansion of university sport around the world created a new need for meets and competitions to complete the Universiade programme. As a consequence, FISU launched the World University Championships (WUC) in the early sixties.\n\nOver 50 years, more than 300 championships have been organised, covering a large range of events (almost always different from the Universiade sports) and gathering participants from all over the world. Meant to guarantee continuity in the competition programme, these championships take place on even-numbered years and experience an increasing success over the years. They allow a large number of students and university sports leaders to get together on occasions other than Universiades. In 2000, 20 World University Championships were held in different places for different sports, attracting 3,623 participants. In 2002, 24 World University Championships were held, attracting 4,228 participants from 83 countries. In 2010, 27 championships were staged, bringing together 4,431 participants. For 2014, 29 WUC were attributed.\n\nIn 2011, the International University Sports Federation moved its headquarters from [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].\n\nFollowing a breathtaking 27th Summer Universiade in Kazan (RUS) where no more than eleven (11) Championship sports where present, as well as a successful year of World University Championships in 2012, where 27 events took place in 17 countries over 4 continents, the 2014 edition of WUCs was amazing. Starting early March and running until mid-December, the 2014 World University Championships included 28 events in a single year, this time in 23 countries and over the 5 continents (17 Europe, 7 Asia, 2 America, 1 Africa and 1 Oceania). The Championships took place for the first time in Belarus, India, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nThe most recent edition of the Summer Universiade was held in Naples, Italy, in the Summer 2019. Meanwhile, the most recent Winter Universiade was held in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The 2021 edition of the Summer Universiade will be organised in [[Chengdu]], [[China]], while the 2021 Winter Universiade's host will be [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Mission===\nThe FISU (International University Sports Federation) was formed within university institutions in order to promote sports values and encourage sports practice in harmony with and complementary to the university spirit. Promoting sports values means encouraging friendship, fraternity, fair-play, perseverance, integrity, cooperation and application amongst students, who one day will have responsibilities and even key positions in politics, the economy, culture and industry. As allies or competitors, perhaps even as antagonists, these men and women will have learned how to collaborate and deal with every eventuality, whilst respecting the ethical code enshrined in these values. Promoting sports values and sports practice also implies giving a new dimension to the university spirit in study, research, and discipline, through the strong affirmation of the full humanist development of the individual and of society at large. This development is not just intellectual, but also moral and physical.\n\nUniversity students should be able to practice sport at the level of their choice within their university. Even if they reach a high level of competition in their sport, students should not consider these competitions as an end in itself, but as an element enabling them to develop their own potential, in the same way as they prepare for their professional life. Seeing its international dimension, FISU brings together the university community in a broader sense, necessarily transcending the conflicts which divide countries and people, to achieve harmony between academic excellence and top-level sport, or competition and leisure sport. The world university sports movement also aims to become a powerful channel of communication for bringing together the various communities, the rich diversity of which is all too often a source of conflict today. This philosophy necessarily implies that FISU not only has an international dimension, but is also independent and free, regardless of the source of financial and technical support from its institutional, academic, financial or media partners.<ref>[http://www.fisu.net/en/FISU-today-3417.html FISU Today].

Over the years the image of the International University Sports Federation (FISU) had become confused, being sometimes mistaken for the image of the events FISU was organising. To remedy this situation, it was important to provide each of the endorsed events with a clearly identifiable symbol. The solution was to concentrate the International University Sports Federation's image on the stars, and use the letter 'U' to identify the Universiades and World Championships. This creates a clear hierarchy between the identity of the individual event and its endorsement by the International University Sports Federation.<ref>[http://www.fisu.net/en/Brand-3466.html FISU Brand].

It is only second to the Olympic Games. The Summer Universiade consists of 11 compulsory sports with 14 compulsory disciplines and up to three optional sports chosen by the host country. The record figures are 10,622 participants in Shenzhen, China, in 2011 and 174 countries in Daegu, Korea, in 2003.\n\nThe Summer Universiade is the only summer multi-sport event in the world that connects students at both academic and athletic levels. During 12 days of sports competitions more than 9,000 student-athletes and officials from over 170 countries participate in the different events. Both volunteers and participants are students, generally of the same age, which creates a unique and loosened atmosphere throughout the competitions. The Summer Universiade is broadcast by more than 100 TV channels from all over the world.\n\nEmbracing FISU\u2019s motto of 'Excellence in Mind and Body', the Summer Universiade incorporates educational and cultural aspects into 12 days of sports competitions, allowing university student-athletes from all over the world to celebrate with the host city in a true spirit of friendship and sportsmanship.<ref name=\"Summer Universiade\">[http://www.fisu.net/en/Summer-Universiades-3490.html Summer Universiade].

Optional sports vary from one Summer Universiade to another. Depending on their own interests, Organising Committees may choose from the list of the World University Championships (WUC) up to 3 optional sports to be included in their specific sports programme. For the most recent Universiades in Shenzhen (CHN), Kazan (RUS) and Gwangju (KOR) the total number of sports has reached a peak with 24, 27 and 21 sports featured respectively. In [[Taipei]] were  21 again.

This major academic conference is one of FISU\u2019s traditional events as the first edition was organised way back in 1960. The FISU Summer Universiade Conference is always organised in cooperation with the highest local academic authorities ensuring the academic level and scientific credibility.\n\nThe objective of the FISU Summer Universiade Conference is to create a platform to present scientific papers on university sport and to stimulate research on this topic. The themes discussed in the conference focus on the study of university sport further elaborated with keynote addresses, poster presentations, paper-presentation sessions and discussion groups.\n\nThe FISU Summer Universiade Conference is a key FISU event as it allows many of the student-athletes who compete in the Universiade to take part in an international academic conference. It fosters the academic spirit in the sports arena. The FISU Summer Universiade Conference is open to all accredited participants of the Universiade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-A-conference-4060.html|title=Educational Services The FISU Summer Universiade Conference|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Winter Universiade Conference'''\nAlong with the Winter Universiade, FISU provides the organising committee with the opportunity to host a scientific conference. The objective of the FISU Winter Universiade Conference is to create a networking platform for scientists who will present and promote the research on scientific innovations and enhance the sustainable development of winter sports. It is an opportunity for the young generation of sport scientists to discuss new ideas or to arrange projects/cooperative efforts in the area of sports science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-B-conference-WU-4062.html|title=Educational Services The FISU Winter Universiade Conference|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Forum'''\nLike the Universiade, the Conference is biennial. This is why FISU decided to give students and university sports officials the opportunity to meet more often to discuss subjects involving education, culture and sport, through the FISU Forum. The Forum takes place every two years, alternating with the Universiade years, each time in a different location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-C-Forum-4064.html|title=The FISU Forum|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Sport Education Summit'''\nThe FISU Sport Education Summit gathers university rectors from around the world during two days to discuss the place of sport within higher education systems. The main aims of this event are to exchange ideas regarding the development of university sport and to understand the way university sport is organised in the different parts of the world. Every edition of the FISU Sport Education Summit brings together University Rectors, Presidents, Vice-Chancellors, Vice- Presidents and other high-ranking university leaders from the five continents. For FISU, it is of great importance to come to an understanding with such key actors as Rectors or Chancellors on the significance and values of sport for the students\u2019 communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-D-Educ-summit-4066.html|title=Educational Services The FISU Sport Education Summit|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Seminars'''\nThe FISU Seminar gives committee and staff members along with organisers of FISU events the opportunity to fully understand the FISU environment and to achieve better cooperation in their activities within FISU.

The following year saw the birth of the International Confederation of Students (ICS), which held a congress in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. Several delegations took part and the movement was launched. From 1925 to 1939, many great sporting events were organized by the students and the ICS: in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1925, [[Rome]], [[Italy]] in 1927, then again in Paris, [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] (1930), [[Turin]], [[Italy]] (1933), [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (1935), Paris (1937) and [[Monaco]] (1939). The [[World War II|Second World War]] interrupted these meetings, but when peace was restored, France re-launched the World University Games.\n\nThe peace was relative, and the shadow of the [[Cold War]] soon divided university sport. In 1946, the International Students Union (ISU) was created in Prague to pursue the works of the International Confederation of Students, and it organised the 9th World University Games in 1947. After those games, the increasing politicisation of the ISU led to a division within the university sports movement. In 1948, the International University Sports Federation (FISU) was created under the impetus of Paul Schleimer of [[Luxembourg]], and it launched the International University Sport Weeks in 1949 in [[Meran]], Italy. Other editions followed: in Luxembourg (1951), [[Dortmund]] (1953) and [[Donostia|San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (1955). In 1957, the French federation organised a World University Sports Championship which brought together students from the Eastern and Western blocks. From this meet arose the desire to organise a universal event in which students from all over the world could participate.\n\nIn 1959, FISU and the ISU agreed to participate in the games organised in Turin, Italy, by CUSI, the Italian Student Sports Association. That year was undoubtedly the one that left the biggest impression on our federation. In fact, the Italian organisers baptised these 1959 games 'Universiade'. They created the flag with a 'U' surrounded by stars, which was to begin its journey around the world, and replaced the national anthems at the medal-awarding ceremonies with [[Gaudeamus Igitur]]. The Universiade in Turin was a success for the local Executive Committee, as well as for the man who was to change the future of the university sports movement: Dr. [[Primo Nebiolo]]. During this Universiade, which brought together 43 countries and 1,400 participants, many non-member federations applied to become members of FISU.\n\nHowever, even though university sport was developing in a peaceful environment, the [[modus vivendi]] still needed to be established. In addition to the agreement that had been made concerning national symbols (neither flags nor anthems) and the programme, FISU defined its philosophy in article 2 of its statutes by stipulating: 'FISU pursues its objects without consideration or discrimination of a political, denominational or racial nature'. From then on, FISU was to organise the games at worldwide level.<ref>[http://www.fisu.net/medias/fichiers/FISU_Statutes_2009_English_Version.pdf FISU Statutes] Retrieved 2016-01-19.</ref>\n\nEver since this important period, the Universiades have continued to attract more and more participants. Starting with a total of 1,407 participants in Turin, Italy, in 1959, FISU reached a total of 6,757 participants from more than 165 countries in Beijing, China, in 2001, and 6,643 participants from 174 countries in Daegu, Korea, in 2003. The highest number of participants was registered at the 2013 Summer Universiade in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]], i.e. 11,759 representing 159 countries.\n\nThe Winter Universiades have experienced the same success. In fact, statistics show that 98 athletes participated in the games in [[Zell am See]], [[Austria]], in 1958, while a record of 2,668 participants from 52 countries came to the Winter Universiade in [[Trentino]], Italy, in 2013. The expansion of university sport around the world created a new need for meets and competitions to complete the Universiade programme. As a consequence, FISU launched the World University Championships (WUC) in the early sixties.\n\nOver 50 years, more than 300 championships have been organised, covering a large range of events (almost always different from the Universiade sports) and gathering participants from all over the world. Meant to guarantee continuity in the competition programme, these championships take place on even-numbered years and experience an increasing success over the years. They allow a large number of students and university sports leaders to get together on occasions other than Universiades. In 2000, 20 World University Championships were held in different places for different sports, attracting 3,623 participants. In 2002, 24 World University Championships were held, attracting 4,228 participants from 83 countries. In 2010, 27 championships were staged, bringing together 4,431 participants. For 2014, 29 WUC were attributed.\n\nIn 2011, the International University Sports Federation moved its headquarters from [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].\n\nFollowing a breathtaking 27th Summer Universiade in Kazan (RUS) where no more than eleven (11) Championship sports where present, as well as a successful year of World University Championships in 2012, where 27 events took place in 17 countries over 4 continents, the 2014 edition of WUCs was amazing. Starting early March and running until mid-December, the 2014 World University Championships included 28 events in a single year, this time in 23 countries and over the 5 continents (17 Europe, 7 Asia, 2 America, 1 Africa and 1 Oceania). The Championships took place for the first time in Belarus, India, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nThe most recent edition of the Summer Universiade was held in Naples, Italy, in the Summer 2019. Meanwhile, the most recent Winter Universiade was held in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The 2021 edition of the Summer Universiade will be organised in [[Chengdu]], [[China]], while the 2021 Winter Universiade's host will be [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Mission===\nThe FISU (International University Sports Federation) was formed within university institutions in order to promote sports values and encourage sports practice in harmony with and complementary to the university spirit. Promoting sports values means encouraging friendship, fraternity, fair-play, perseverance, integrity, cooperation and application amongst students, who one day will have responsibilities and even key positions in politics, the economy, culture and industry. As allies or competitors, perhaps even as antagonists, these men and women will have learned how to collaborate and deal with every eventuality, whilst respecting the ethical code enshrined in these values. Promoting sports values and sports practice also implies giving a new dimension to the university spirit in study, research, and discipline, through the strong affirmation of the full humanist development of the individual and of society at large. This development is not just intellectual, but also moral and physical.\n\nUniversity students should be able to practice sport at the level of their choice within their university. Even if they reach a high level of competition in their sport, students should not consider these competitions as an end in itself, but as an element enabling them to develop their own potential, in the same way as they prepare for their professional life. Seeing its international dimension, FISU brings together the university community in a broader sense, necessarily transcending the conflicts which divide countries and people, to achieve harmony between academic excellence and top-level sport, or competition and leisure sport. The world university sports movement also aims to become a powerful channel of communication for bringing together the various communities, the rich diversity of which is all too often a source of conflict today. This philosophy necessarily implies that FISU not only has an international dimension, but is also independent and free, regardless of the source of financial and technical support from its institutional, academic, financial or media partners.<ref>[http://www.fisu.net/en/FISU-today-3417.html FISU Today].

It adopts the budget and the programme of FISU activities.\n\n'''The Executive Committee''''\nThe Executive Committee is composed of 23 members. It meets twice a year to take the decisions necessary for the proper functioning of FISU. The Steering Committee consists of the President, the first Vice-President, the four Vice-Presidents, the Secretary General, the Treasurer and the first Assessor. It meets periodically when convened by the President, to carry out the business of FISU between meetings of the Executive Committee.\n\n'''FISU Office'''\nThe General Secretariat is in charge of FISU's administrative work and it is based at the \u2018Maison du Sport International\u2019 in Lausanne, Switzerland, a unique complex that brings together under one roof several of the leading players in international sports administration. This new infrastructure constitutes a remarkable opportunity for FISU, allowing to work together, cultivate contacts, share experience and exploit synergies.\n\n'''The Committees'''\nThe committees assist and advise the Executive Committee in the overall administration of FISU. There are 16 permanent committees:\n# International Technical Committees \u2013 CTI: one for the Summer Universiade, one for the Winter Universiade and one for the World University Championships; monitors the preparation of competitions from a technical point of view, drawing up the competition programme and ensuring the good running of the event.\n# Committee for Sports Regulations \u2013 CRS: ensures that the sports regulations are updated and proposes new rules to the EC.\n# Medical Committee \u2013 CM: supervises the organisation of medical care, as well as the norms of security and hygiene; supervises the anti-doping control procedures.\n# International Control Committee \u2013 CIC: verifies that the participants fulfill the conditions of participation.\n# Education Committee \u2013 EduC: promotes the study of university sport by organising the Conference during the Universiade, as well as the FISU Forum.\n# Media and Communication Committee \u2013 CMC: inspects and controls all the infrastructures and technical means provided to the press; cooperates with international media to ensure media coverage of FISU events.\n# Universiade Supervision Committee (Summer) \u2013 CSU: responsible for supervising the progress made in the preparation of the Summer Universiades, by making inspection visits and meeting regularly with the leaders of the Organising Committees.\n# Universiade Supervision Committee (Winter) \u2013 CSU: responsible for supervising the progress made in the preparation of the Winter Universiades, by making inspection visits and meeting regularly with the leaders of the Organising Committees.\n# Finance Committee \u2013 CF: studies the budget plan with the Treasurer.\n# Committee for the Development of University Sport \u2013 CDSU: responsible for studying all the projects aiming at developing the structures of FISU and its member associations.\n# Committee for Gender Equality \u2013 CEG: responsible for studying all the projects aiming at developing women's sport within FISU and its member associations.\n# Legal Committee \u2013 CJ: advises the EC on all legal matters related to FISU activities.\n# Intercontinental Council \u2013 CI: assesses the specific needs to encourage, support and enhance university sport in each continent.\n# Student Committee \u2013 CdE: represents the student athletes and student managers involved in university sports organisations.\n# Committee for Marketing and Strategic Partnership \u2013 CMPS: assists FISU in developing a better understanding of modern technology and the huge potential for university sport stakeholders to forge global and national partnerships from within the sports movement and beyond.\n# Disciplinary Committee \u2013 CD: preserves the integrity and reputation of FISU and FISU events, and contributes to ensure the security of the FISU student athletes.\n\n'''The Internal Auditor'''\nThe Auditor verifies FISU accountancy.<ref>[http://fisu.net/en/Current-structure-3427.html Current structure].

Over the years the image of the International University Sports Federation (FISU) had become confused, being sometimes mistaken for the image of the events FISU was organising. To remedy this situation, it was important to provide each of the endorsed events with a clearly identifiable symbol. The solution was to concentrate the International University Sports Federation's image on the stars, and use the letter 'U' to identify the Universiades and World Championships. This creates a clear hierarchy between the identity of the individual event and its endorsement by the International University Sports Federation.<ref>[http://www.fisu.net/en/Brand-3466.html FISU Brand].

The record figures are 10,622 participants in Shenzhen, China, in 2011 and 174 countries in Daegu, Korea, in 2003.\n\nThe Summer Universiade is the only summer multi-sport event in the world that connects students at both academic and athletic levels. During 12 days of sports competitions more than 9,000 student-athletes and officials from over 170 countries participate in the different events. Both volunteers and participants are students, generally of the same age, which creates a unique and loosened atmosphere throughout the competitions. The Summer Universiade is broadcast by more than 100 TV channels from all over the world.\n\nEmbracing FISU\u2019s motto of 'Excellence in Mind and Body', the Summer Universiade incorporates educational and cultural aspects into 12 days of sports competitions, allowing university student-athletes from all over the world to celebrate with the host city in a true spirit of friendship and sportsmanship.<ref name=\"Summer Universiade\">[http://www.fisu.net/en/Summer-Universiades-3490.html Summer Universiade].

Depending on their own interests, Organising Committees may choose from the list of the World University Championships (WUC) up to 3 optional sports to be included in their specific sports programme. For the most recent Universiades in Shenzhen (CHN), Kazan (RUS) and Gwangju (KOR) the total number of sports has reached a peak with 24, 27 and 21 sports featured respectively.

This major academic conference is one of FISU\u2019s traditional events as the first edition was organised way back in 1960. The FISU Summer Universiade Conference is always organised in cooperation with the highest local academic authorities ensuring the academic level and scientific credibility.\n\nThe objective of the FISU Summer Universiade Conference is to create a platform to present scientific papers on university sport and to stimulate research on this topic. The themes discussed in the conference focus on the study of university sport further elaborated with keynote addresses, poster presentations, paper-presentation sessions and discussion groups.\n\nThe FISU Summer Universiade Conference is a key FISU event as it allows many of the student-athletes who compete in the Universiade to take part in an international academic conference. It fosters the academic spirit in the sports arena. The FISU Summer Universiade Conference is open to all accredited participants of the Universiade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-A-conference-4060.html|title=Educational Services The FISU Summer Universiade Conference|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Winter Universiade Conference'''\nAlong with the Winter Universiade, FISU provides the organising committee with the opportunity to host a scientific conference.

The Forum takes place every two years, alternating with the Universiade years, each time in a different location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-C-Forum-4064.html|title=The FISU Forum|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Sport Education Summit'''\nThe FISU Sport Education Summit gathers university rectors from around the world during two days to discuss the place of sport within higher education systems. The main aims of this event are to exchange ideas regarding the development of university sport and to understand the way university sport is organised in the different parts of the world. Every edition of the FISU Sport Education Summit brings together University Rectors, Presidents, Vice-Chancellors, Vice- Presidents and other high-ranking university leaders from the five continents. For FISU, it is of great importance to come to an understanding with such key actors as Rectors or Chancellors on the significance and values of sport for the students\u2019 communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/en/Educ-D-Educ-summit-4066.html|title=Educational Services The FISU Sport Education Summit|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''The FISU Seminars'''\nThe FISU Seminar gives committee and staff members along with organisers of FISU events the opportunity to fully understand the FISU environment and to achieve better cooperation in their activities within FISU.

None include any higher names in the googol family (googolduplex, etc.). The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' comments that ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' are \"not in formal mathematical use\".\n\n==Usage of names of large numbers==\nSome names of large numbers, such as ''million'', ''billion'', and ''trillion'', have real referents in human experience, and are encountered in many contexts. At times, the names of large numbers have been forced into common usage as a result of [[hyperinflation]]. The highest numerical value banknote ever printed was a note for 1 sextillion [[peng\u0151]] (10<sup>21</sup> or 1 milliard bilpeng\u0151 as printed) printed in [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 2009, [[Zimbabwe]] printed a 100&nbsp;trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) [[Zimbabwean dollar]] note, which at the time of printing was worth about US$30.<ref name=zimbabwe>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7832601.stm|title=Zimbabwe rolls out Z$100tr note|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>\n\nNames of larger numbers, however, have a tenuous, artificial existence, rarely found outside definitions, lists, and discussions of the ways in which large numbers are named. Even well-established names like ''sextillion'' are rarely used, since in the context of science, including astronomy, where such large numbers often occur, they are nearly always written using [[scientific notation]]. In this notation, powers of ten are expressed as ''10'' with a numeric superscript, e.g. \"The X-ray emission of the radio galaxy is {{val|1.3|e=45|u=joules}}.\" When a number such as 10<sup>45</sup> needs to be referred to in words, it is simply read out as \"ten to the forty-fifth\". This is easier to say and less ambiguous than \"quattuordecillion\", which means something different in the long scale and the short scale.\n\nWhen a number represents a quantity rather than a count, [[SI prefix]]es can be used\u2014thus \"femtosecond\", not \"one quadrillionth of a second\"\u2014although often powers of ten are used instead of some of the very high and very low prefixes. In some cases, specialized units are used, such as the astronomer's [[parsec]] and [[light year]] or the particle physicist's [[barn (unit)|barn]].\n\nNevertheless, large numbers have an intellectual fascination and are of mathematical interest, and giving them names is one of the ways in which people try to conceptualize and understand them.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of this is ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', in which [[Archimedes]] gave a system for naming large numbers. To do this, he called the numbers up to a [[myriad]] myriad (10<sup>8</sup>) \"first numbers\" and called 10<sup>8</sup> itself the \"unit of the second numbers\". Multiples of this unit then became the second numbers, up to this unit taken a myriad myriad times, 10<sup>8</sup>\u00b710<sup>8</sup>=10<sup>16</sup>. This became the \"unit of the third numbers\", whose multiples were the third numbers, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad myriad times the unit of the 10<sup>8</sup>-th numbers, i.e. <math>(10^8)^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^8},</math> and embedded this construction within another copy of itself to produce names for numbers up to <math>((10^8)^{(10^8)})^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^{16}}.</math> Archimedes then estimated the number of grains of sand that would be required to fill the known universe, and found that it was no more than \"one thousand myriad of the eighth numbers\" (10<sup>63</sup>).\n\nSince then, many others have engaged in the pursuit of conceptualizing and naming numbers that really have no existence outside the imagination. One motivation for such a pursuit is that attributed to the inventor of the word ''[[googol]]'', who was certain that any finite number \"had to have a name\". Another possible motivation is competition between students in computer programming courses, where a common exercise is that of writing a program to output numbers in the form of English words.\n\nMost names proposed for large numbers belong to systematic schemes which are extensible. Thus, many names for large numbers are simply the result of following a naming system to its logical conclusion\u2014or extending it further.\n\n==Origins of the \"standard dictionary numbers\"==\n[[File:Chuquet.gif|right|500px]]\n\nThe&nbsp;words ''bymillion'' and ''trimillion'' were first recorded in 1475 in a manuscript of [[Jehan Adam]]. Subsequently, [[Nicolas Chuquet]] wrote a book ''Triparty en la science des nombres'' which was not published during Chuquet's lifetime. However, most of it was copied by [[Estienne de La Roche]] for a portion of his 1520 book, ''[[L'arismetique]]''. Chuquet's book contains a passage in which he shows a large number marked off into groups of six digits, with the comment:\n\n<blockquote>\nOu qui veult le premier point peult signiffier million Le second point byllion Le tiers point tryllion Le quart quadrillion Le cinq<sup>e</sup> quyllion Le six<sup>e</sup> sixlion Le sept.<sup>e</sup> septyllion Le huyt<sup>e</sup> ottyllion Le neuf<sup>e</sup> nonyllion et ainsi des ault'<sup>s</sup> se plus oultre on vouloit preceder\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(Or if you prefer the first mark can signify million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go).\n</blockquote>\n\nAdam and Chuquet used the [[long and short scales|long scale]] of powers of a million; that is, Adam's ''bymillion'' (Chuquet's ''byllion'') denoted 10<sup>12</sup>, and Adam's ''trimillion'' (Chuquet's ''tryllion'') denoted 10<sup>18</sup>.\n\n==The googol family==\nThe names ''[[googol]]'' and ''[[googolplex]]'' were invented by [[Edward Kasner]]'s nephew Milton Sirotta and introduced in Kasner and Newman's 1940 book ''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]''<ref>Kasner, Edward, and James Newman, ''Mathematics and the Imagination,'' 1940, Simon and Schuster, New York.</ref>\nin the following passage:\n{{quote|The name \"googol\" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely 1 with one hundred zeroes after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At the same time that he suggested \"googol\" he gave a name for a still larger number: \"Googolplex\". A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would actually happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have [[Primo Carnera|Carnera]] a better mathematician than [[Albert Einstein|Dr. Einstein]], simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex is, then, a specific finite number, equal to 1 with a googol zeros after it.}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=200 | Value\n! Name\n!

This gives rise to the name ''googolplexplex'' for 10<sup>googolplex</sup> = 10{{sup|10{{sup|10{{sup|100}}}}}}. This number (ten to the power of a googolplex) is also known as a googolduplex and googolplexian.<ref>Bowers, Jonathan. \"Infinity Scrapers\". Polytope, 2010.</ref> Conway and Guy<ref name=a /> have proposed that ''N-minex'' be used as a name for 10<sup>\u2212N</sup>, giving rise to the name ''googolminex'' for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of a googolplex. None of these names are in wide use, nor are any currently found in dictionaries.\n\nThe names ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' inspired the name of the [[Dot-com company|Internet company]] [[Google]] and its [[corporate headquarters]], the [[Googleplex]], respectively.\n\n==Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers==\nThis section illustrates several systems for naming large numbers, and shows how they can be extended past ''vigintillion''.\n\nTraditional British usage assigned new names for each power of one million (the [[long and short scales|long scale]]): {{nowrap|1,000,000 {{=}} 1 million}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1 billion}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1 trillion}}; and so on. It was adapted from French usage, and is similar to the system that was documented or invented by [[Nicolas Chuquet|Chuquet]].\n\nTraditional American usage (which was also adapted from French usage but at a later date), Canadian, and modern British usage assign new names for each power of one thousand (the [[long and short scales|short scale]].) Thus, a ''billion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>9</sup>; a ''trillion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>12</sup>; and so forth. Due to its dominance in the financial world (and by the [[US dollar]]), this was adopted for official [[United Nations]] documents.\n\nTraditional French usage has varied; in 1948, France, which had been using the short scale, reverted to the long scale.\n\nThe term ''milliard'' is unambiguous and always means 10<sup>9</sup>. It is almost never seen in American usage and rarely in British usage, but frequently in continental European usage. The term is sometimes attributed to French mathematician [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] circa 1550 (for this reason, the long scale is also known as the ''Chuquet-Peletier'' system), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the term derives from post-Classical [[Latin]] term ''milliartum'', which became ''milliare'' and then ''milliart'' and finally our modern term.\n\nWith regard to names ending in -illiard for numbers 10<sup>6''n''+3</sup>, ''milliard'' is certainly in widespread use in languages other than English, but the degree of actual use of the larger terms is questionable. The terms \"Milliarde\" in German, \"miljard\" in Dutch, \"milyar\" in Turkish and \"\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0434\" in Russian are standard usage when discussing financial topics.\n\nFor additional details, see [[billion (disambiguation)|billion]] and [[long and short scales]].\n\nThe naming procedure for large numbers is based on taking the number ''n'' occurring in 10<sup>3''n''+3</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6''n''</sup> (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix ''-illion''. In this way, numbers up to 10<sup>3\u00b7999+3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>3000</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6\u00b7999</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>5994</sup> (long scale) may be named. The choice of roots and the concatenation procedure is that of the standard dictionary numbers if ''n'' is 20 or smaller. For larger ''n'' (between 21 and 999), prefixes can be constructed based on a system described by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]:<ref name=a />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n!Units\n!Tens\n!Hundreds\n|-\n!1\n|Un\n|Deci\n|Centi\n|-\n!2\n|Duo\n|Viginti\n|Ducenti\n|-\n!3\n|Tre\n|Triginta\n|Trecenti\n|-\n!4\n|Quattuor\n|Quadraginta\n|Quadringenti\n|-\n!5\n|Quin\n|Quinquaginta\n|Quingenti\n|-\n!6\n|Sex\n|Sexaginta\n|Sescenti\n|-\n!7\n|Septen\n|Septuaginta\n|Septingenti\n|-\n!8\n|Octo\n|Octoginta\n|Octingenti\n|-\n!9\n|Novem\n|Nonaginta\n|Nongenti\n|}\n\nThe following table shows number names generated by the system described by Conway and Guy for the short and long scales.\n\n'''Names of reciprocals of large numbers''' are not listed, as they are regularly formed by adding -th, e.g. ''quattuordecillionth,'' ''centillionth,'' etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|short scale]])\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|long scale]])\n!Value\n!

None include any higher names in the googol family (googolduplex, etc.). The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' comments that ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' are \"not in formal mathematical use\".\n\n==Usage of names of large numbers==\nSome names of large numbers, such as ''million'', ''billion'', and ''trillion'', have real referents in human experience, and are encountered in many contexts. At times, the names of large numbers have been forced into common usage as a result of [[hyperinflation]]. The highest numerical value banknote ever printed was a note for 1 sextillion [[peng\u0151]] (10<sup>21</sup> or 1 milliard bilpeng\u0151 as printed) printed in [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 2009, [[Zimbabwe]] printed a 100&nbsp;trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) [[Zimbabwean dollar]] note, which at the time of printing was worth about US$30.<ref name=zimbabwe>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7832601.stm|title=Zimbabwe rolls out Z$100tr note|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>\n\nNames of larger numbers, however, have a tenuous, artificial existence, rarely found outside definitions, lists, and discussions of the ways in which large numbers are named. Even well-established names like ''sextillion'' are rarely used, since in the context of science, including astronomy, where such large numbers often occur, they are nearly always written using [[scientific notation]]. In this notation, powers of ten are expressed as ''10'' with a numeric superscript, e.g. \"The X-ray emission of the radio galaxy is {{val|1.3|e=45|u=joules}}.\" When a number such as 10<sup>45</sup> needs to be referred to in words, it is simply read out as \"ten to the forty-fifth\". This is easier to say and less ambiguous than \"quattuordecillion\", which means something different in the long scale and the short scale.\n\nWhen a number represents a quantity rather than a count, [[SI prefix]]es can be used\u2014thus \"femtosecond\", not \"one quadrillionth of a second\"\u2014although often powers of ten are used instead of some of the very high and very low prefixes. In some cases, specialized units are used, such as the astronomer's [[parsec]] and [[light year]] or the particle physicist's [[barn (unit)|barn]].\n\nNevertheless, large numbers have an intellectual fascination and are of mathematical interest, and giving them names is one of the ways in which people try to conceptualize and understand them.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of this is ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', in which [[Archimedes]] gave a system for naming large numbers. To do this, he called the numbers up to a [[myriad]] myriad (10<sup>8</sup>) \"first numbers\" and called 10<sup>8</sup> itself the \"unit of the second numbers\". Multiples of this unit then became the second numbers, up to this unit taken a myriad myriad times, 10<sup>8</sup>\u00b710<sup>8</sup>=10<sup>16</sup>. This became the \"unit of the third numbers\", whose multiples were the third numbers, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad myriad times the unit of the 10<sup>8</sup>-th numbers, i.e. <math>(10^8)^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^8},</math> and embedded this construction within another copy of itself to produce names for numbers up to <math>((10^8)^{(10^8)})^{(10^8)}=10^{8\\cdot 10^{16}}.</math> Archimedes then estimated the number of grains of sand that would be required to fill the known universe, and found that it was no more than \"one thousand myriad of the eighth numbers\" (10<sup>63</sup>).\n\nSince then, many others have engaged in the pursuit of conceptualizing and naming numbers that really have no existence outside the imagination. One motivation for such a pursuit is that attributed to the inventor of the word ''[[googol]]'', who was certain that any finite number \"had to have a name\". Another possible motivation is competition between students in computer programming courses, where a common exercise is that of writing a program to output numbers in the form of English words.\n\nMost names proposed for large numbers belong to systematic schemes which are extensible. Thus, many names for large numbers are simply the result of following a naming system to its logical conclusion\u2014or extending it further.\n\n==Origins of the \"standard dictionary numbers\"==\n[[File:Chuquet.gif|right|500px]]\n\nThe&nbsp;words ''bymillion'' and ''trimillion'' were first recorded in 1475 in a manuscript of [[Jehan Adam]]. Subsequently, [[Nicolas Chuquet]] wrote a book ''Triparty en la science des nombres'' which was not published during Chuquet's lifetime. However, most of it was copied by [[Estienne de La Roche]] for a portion of his 1520 book, ''[[L'arismetique]]''. Chuquet's book contains a passage in which he shows a large number marked off into groups of six digits, with the comment:\n\n<blockquote>\nOu qui veult le premier point peult signiffier million Le second point byllion Le tiers point tryllion Le quart quadrillion Le cinq<sup>e</sup> quyllion Le six<sup>e</sup> sixlion Le sept.<sup>e</sup> septyllion Le huyt<sup>e</sup> ottyllion Le neuf<sup>e</sup> nonyllion et ainsi des ault'<sup>s</sup> se plus oultre on vouloit preceder\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(Or if you prefer the first mark can signify million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go).\n</blockquote>\n\nAdam and Chuquet used the [[long and short scales|long scale]] of powers of a million; that is, Adam's ''bymillion'' (Chuquet's ''byllion'') denoted 10<sup>12</sup>, and Adam's ''trimillion'' (Chuquet's ''tryllion'') denoted 10<sup>18</sup>.\n\n==The googol family==\nThe names ''[[googol]]'' and ''[[googolplex]]'' were invented by [[Edward Kasner]]'s nephew Milton Sirotta and introduced in Kasner and Newman's 1940 book ''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]''<ref>Kasner, Edward, and James Newman, ''Mathematics and the Imagination,'' 1940, Simon and Schuster, New York.</ref>\nin the following passage:\n{{quote|The name \"googol\" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely 1 with one hundred zeroes after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At the same time that he suggested \"googol\" he gave a name for a still larger number: \"Googolplex\". A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would actually happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have [[Primo Carnera|Carnera]] a better mathematician than [[Albert Einstein|Dr. Einstein]], simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex is, then, a specific finite number, equal to 1 with a googol zeros after it.}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=200 | Value\n! Name\n!

This gives rise to the name ''googolplexplex'' for 10<sup>googolplex</sup> = 10{{sup|10{{sup|10{{sup|100}}}}}}. This number (ten to the power of a googolplex) is also known as a googolduplex and googolplexian.<ref>Bowers, Jonathan. \"Infinity Scrapers\". Polytope, 2010.</ref> Conway and Guy<ref name=a /> have proposed that ''N-minex'' be used as a name for 10<sup>\u2212N</sup>, giving rise to the name ''googolminex'' for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of a googolplex. None of these names are in wide use, nor are any currently found in dictionaries.\n\nThe names ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' inspired the name of the [[Dot-com company|Internet company]] [[Google]] and its [[corporate headquarters]], the [[Googleplex]], respectively.\n\n==Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers==\nThis section illustrates several systems for naming large numbers, and shows how they can be extended past ''vigintillion''.\n\nTraditional British usage assigned new names for each power of one million (the [[long and short scales|long scale]]): {{nowrap|1,000,000 {{=}} 1 million}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1 billion}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1 trillion}}; and so on. It was adapted from French usage, and is similar to the system that was documented or invented by [[Nicolas Chuquet|Chuquet]].\n\nTraditional American usage (which was also adapted from French usage but at a later date), Canadian, and modern British usage assign new names for each power of one thousand (the [[long and short scales|short scale]].) Thus, a ''billion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>9</sup>; a ''trillion'' is 1000 \u00d7 1000<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>12</sup>; and so forth. Due to its dominance in the financial world (and by the [[US dollar]]), this was adopted for official [[United Nations]] documents.\n\nTraditional French usage has varied; in 1948, France, which had been using the short scale, reverted to the long scale.\n\nThe term ''milliard'' is unambiguous and always means 10<sup>9</sup>. It is almost never seen in American usage and rarely in British usage, but frequently in continental European usage. The term is sometimes attributed to French mathematician [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] circa 1550 (for this reason, the long scale is also known as the ''Chuquet-Peletier'' system), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the term derives from post-Classical [[Latin]] term ''milliartum'', which became ''milliare'' and then ''milliart'' and finally our modern term.\n\nWith regard to names ending in -illiard for numbers 10<sup>6''n''+3</sup>, ''milliard'' is certainly in widespread use in languages other than English, but the degree of actual use of the larger terms is questionable. The terms \"Milliarde\" in German, \"miljard\" in Dutch, \"milyar\" in Turkish and \"\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0434\" in Russian are standard usage when discussing financial topics.\n\nFor additional details, see [[billion (disambiguation)|billion]] and [[long and short scales]].\n\nThe naming procedure for large numbers is based on taking the number ''n'' occurring in 10<sup>3''n''+3</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6''n''</sup> (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix ''-illion''. In this way, numbers up to 10<sup>3\u00b7999+3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>3000</sup> (short scale) or 10<sup>6\u00b7999</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>5994</sup> (long scale) may be named. The choice of roots and the concatenation procedure is that of the standard dictionary numbers if ''n'' is 20 or smaller. For larger ''n'' (between 21 and 999), prefixes can be constructed based on a system described by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]:<ref name=a />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n!Units\n!Tens\n!Hundreds\n|-\n!1\n|Un\n|<sup>N</sup> Deci\n|<sup>NX</sup> Centi\n|-\n!2\n|Duo\n|<sup>MS</sup> Viginti\n|<sup>N</sup> Ducenti\n|-\n!3\n|Tre {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>NS</sup> Triginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Trecenti\n|-\n!4\n|Quattuor\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quadraginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quadringenti\n|-\n!5\n|Quin\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quinquaginta\n|<sup>NS</sup> Quingenti\n|-\n!6\n|Se {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>N</sup> Sexaginta\n|<sup>N</sup> Sescenti\n|-\n!7\n|Septe {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|<sup>N</sup> Septuaginta\n|<sup>N</sup> Septingenti\n|-\n!8\n|Octo\n|<sup>MX</sup> Octoginta\n|<sup>MX</sup> Octingenti\n|-\n!9\n|Nove {{ref|increase|(*)}}\n|Nonaginta\n|Nongenti\n|}\n:<sup>(*)</sup> {{note|increase}} When preceding a component marked <sup>S</sup> or <sup>X</sup>, \u201ctre\u201d changes to \u201ctres\u201d and \u201cse\u201d to \u201cses\u201d or \u201csex\u201d; similarly, when preceding a component marked <sup>M</sup> or <sup>N</sup>, \u201csepte\u201d and \u201cnove\u201d change to \u201cseptem\u201d and \u201cnovem\u201d or \u201csepten\u201d and \u201cnoven\u201d.\n\nSince the system of using Latin prefixes will become ambiguous for numbers with exponents of a size which the Romans rarely counted to, like 10<sup>6,000,258</sup>, Conway and Guy have also proposed a consistent set of conventions which permit, in principle, the extension of this system to provide English names for any integer whatsoever.<ref name=a />\n\nThe following table shows number names generated by the system described by Conway and Guy for the short and long scales.\n\n'''Names of reciprocals of large numbers''' are not listed, as they are regularly formed by adding -th, e.g. ''quattuordecillionth,'' ''centillionth,'' etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|short scale]])\n!Base -illion<br />([[long and short scales|long scale]])\n!Value\n!

It was at this time that he and [[Danny Jones]] met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be a Busted-esque band, rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing, boy band for which they were intended.<ref name=\"Guardian04\">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1266615,00.html|title=Mad about the boys|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 November 2007|location=London|date=23 July 2004}}</ref> Fletcher was impressed with Jones's style, and invited him to write with him and Bourne.

During this time together Fletcher and Jones wrote most of their first album, ''[[Room on the 3rd Floor]]''. Bassist [[Dougie Poynter]] and drummer [[Harry Judd]] were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement. Fletcher came up with the idea to name the band after [[Marty McFly]], the main character from his favorite film ''[[Back to the Future]]''. McFly then rose to fame after Busted helped launch them by inviting them to be the opening act on their tour in March 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fletcher|url=http://Www.fanpop.com|accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, McFly made it into the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', beating [[the Beatles]]'s record for \"the youngest band to have a debut album go straight to number one\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Youngest double toppers|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/youngest-double-toppers|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> Fletcher has written the majority of McFly's songs with Jones and Poynter, with occasional contributions by Judd; Bourne has also assisted with songwriting on occasions. As of 15 November 2010, McFly have released five studio albums and two compilation albums. A greatest hits album entitled ''[[Memory Lane: The Best of McFly]]'' which includes a number of B-sides from earlier albums, original demos of well known tracks as well as three new singles, was released in November 2012. As well as being the founding member of McFly, Fletcher plays rhythm guitar, shares lead vocals with Danny Jones, and sometimes undertakes the role of ukulele player and pianist.\n\n=== Songwriting ===\nFletcher has written or co-written ten UK number-one singles: \"[[Crashed the Wedding]]\", \"[[Who's David?]]\", and \"[[3AM / Thunderbirds Are Go!|Thunderbirds]]\" for Busted; and \"[[Five Colours in Her Hair]]\", \"[[Obviously]]\", \"[[All About You/You've Got a Friend|All About You]],\" \"[[I'll Be OK]]\", \"[[Please, Please]]\", \"[[Star Girl (song)|Star Girl]]\", and \"[[Transylvania (McFly song)|Transylvania]]\" for McFly. He co-wrote eight of the songs on ''A Present for Everyone'', as well as all but one (\"Not Alone\", written by Jones) of the tracks on McFly's debut album, ''[[Room on the 3rd Floor]]''.
