He was originally depicted as a murder victim brought back to life as a corporeal [[revenant]] or zombie, though subsequent versions of the character have occasionally depicted a different origin. He is named after the 19th century nursery rhyme \"[[Solomon Grundy (nursery rhyme)|Solomon Grundy]]\".\n\nGrundy was introduced as an enemy of comic book hero [[Alan Scott]] (the original [[Green Lantern]]), but has since become a prominent enemy for a number of superheroes such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], the Green Lantern, and [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]. He also has ties to [[Swamp Thing]].\n\nCyrus Gold debuted in the [[Arrow (season 2)|second]] season of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' portrayed by Graham Shiels. This version never became a zombie but was instead injected with a serum. The character renamed Butch Gilzean a mob enforcer appeared in 2014 on Fox's television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Drew Powell]]. In the later seasons the character was revealed to be Cyrus Gold who eventually became a zombie.\n\n== Publication history ==\nCreated by [[Alfred Bester]],<ref>''Green Lantern'' #223</ref> he first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #61 (October 1944).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=276}}</ref>\n\nGrundy is the focus of one of the four ''[[Faces of Evil]]'' one-shots that explore the aftermath of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', written by [[Scott Kolins]] and [[Geoff Johns]], with art by [[Shane Davis]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/110803-kolins-Grundy.html Scott Kolins on Faces of Evil: Grundy], [[Newsarama]], November 3, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/php/multimedia/album.php?aid=24126 Exclusive Preview: Faces of Evil: Grundy], [[Newsarama]], 13 November 2008.</ref> It is the introduction to a seven part mini-series featuring the character\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n=== Pre-Crisis ===\n==== Earth-Two version's history ====\n[[File:All American Comics 61.jpg|The cover to ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #61, by Paul Reinman.|thumb|left]]\nIn the late 19th century, a wealthy merchant named Cyrus Gold is murdered and his body is disposed of in Slaughter Swamp, near [[Gotham City]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=111}}</ref> Fifty years later, the corpse is reanimated as a huge shambling figure (composed partly of the [[swamp]] matter that has accumulated around the body over the decades) with almost no memory of its past life. Gold murders two escaped criminals who are hiding out in the marsh and steals their clothes. He shows up in a [[hobo]] camp and, when asked about his name, one of the few things he can recall is that he was \"born on a Monday\". One of the men at the camp mentions the nursery rhyme character [[Solomon Grundy (nursery rhyme)|Solomon Grundy]] (who was born on a Monday), and Gold adopts the moniker.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=170-171}}</ref>\n\nStrong, vicious, and nearly mindless, Solomon Grundy falls into a life of crime\u2014or perhaps returns to one, as his scattered residual memories may indicate\u2014attracting the attention of the Green Lantern, [[Alan Scott]]. Grundy proves to be a difficult opponent, unkillable (since he is already dead) and with an inherent resistance to Scott's powers (which cannot affect [[wood]], a substance of which Grundy's reassembled body is now largely composed). He apparently kills Green Lantern, who gives off a green flash. Liking this flash, Grundy commits murders hoping to see the flash again. However the first fight ends when, engaging in fisticuffs with the monster because of the ineffectiveness of his ring, Grundy is hurled under a [[train]] by Green Lantern.\n\nGrundy is revived when a criminal scientist, known as the [[Professor]], injects Grundy with concentrated chlorophyll.{{Issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter this second encounter, Grundy is trapped in a green plasma bubble for a time, until a freak weather occurrence releases him from his prison. Making his way across country, Grundy heads for the headquarters of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Green Lantern arrives early for the meeting and when the other members arrive, they find their headquarters smashed to pieces and Green Lantern missing from the ranks. Johnny turns on the radio, which blares the warning that Solomon Grundy is on the loose; the members believe, based on a large, muddy footprint on the floor, that Grundy got to HQ and took Green Lantern. The radio continues its report, listing cities where Grundy was seen, so each member picks a city and heads for it (Wonder Woman staying behind) to try to find Green Lantern. The scene now shifts back to the moment at JSA HQ where Green Lantern had opened the door. To his surprise, [[Doiby Dickles]] walks in, and informs him that Grundy has freed himself and is on the loose. Green Lantern leaves immediately, hoping to find Grundy before any of the JSA members are hurt going after him. Minutes later, Grundy arrives at JSA HQ, and, not finding the Lantern there, he smashes the place up, then leaves. Green Lantern and Doiby use a special radio-like device Alan Scott had developed that is attuned to the mental wavelengths of Grundy himself; Green Lantern calculates the path of Grundy and announces over the radio in JSA HQ where Grundy will strike. When Green Lantern and Grundy meet, Grundy rips a tree out by its roots and smashes it into the Lantern. Green Lantern fights back with his power ring and fists until both men fall into a nearby stream and over a small waterfall. The Lantern is severely dazed and tries to ward off Grundy with his ring, but he is much too weak. Grundy grabs Green Lantern by the throat and begins to squeeze the life out of him, holding his head underwater. However, Hawkman strikes Grundy with his mace, and Mid-Nite is able to revive the Lantern. A combined attack brings down Grundy, and Green Lantern deposits Grundy on a distant, lifeless planet.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #33 (1947)</ref>\n\nA battle soon commences when Grundy's body gravitates towards young astronomer Dick Cashmere as he learns to ride light waves, resulting in his assuming Cashmere's identity for a time while leaving the real one bound and gagged, though the Society finds him soon after. In this incarnation he gains intelligence, which he subsequently loses when Green Lantern defeats and buries Grundy in 1947.\n\nAt this point, Grundy is freed and enlisted along with several other supervillains by the time-traveling criminal [[Per Degaton]] in his second appearance, who has traveled to 1941 to capture the Justice Society of America on the day of the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], hoping to change history and take over the world. Grundy encounters Green Lantern, the Flash, and Wonder Woman in Echo Park, whom Grundy knows from 1947. Grundy bests the costumed trio, and is summoned by a mysterious voice to deliver them or \"pay the penalty\". The [[All-Star Squadron]] comes to their rescue, [[Shining Knight#Sir Justin|Sir Justin]] faces off against Solomon Grundy and Grundy is the last villain to be transported back, he is thrust back to the moon where he remains for over two decades, as this timeline is erased once Degaton is defeated.<ref>''All-Star Squadron'' #1-3 (Sep.-Oct. 1981)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #183 (1981)</ref>\n\nAfter many years, Grundy is knocked loose from his planet prison and returns to Earth to battle Green Lantern, [[Hourman]], and [[Doctor Fate]]. At this point, he has temporary mastery over all wooden objects. He is imprisoned orbiting the Earth in a stronger bubble created by the combined powers of Green Lantern and Doctor Fate.<ref>''Showcase'' #55 (Mar-Apr. 1965)</ref>\n\nGrundy was once pulled to Earth-1 and substituted for the superstrong [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] due to a machine that was accidentally pulling the Earths together in warp-space and substituting people. During this event he had absorbed some of Dr Fate's magic, is stronger than before, and is even able to telekinetically lift the Flash into the air. He hates Green Lantern so much he thinks everyone he sees is Green Lantern. He is imprisoned inside a mountain by Earth-1 Green Lantern after being lifted up by Earth-1 [[Hawkman]] and dazed by blows from all the heroes, but when the machine is turned off he is substituted for Blockbuster on Earth-2 and renews the attack, defeating numerous heroes. However the JSA and JLA went to battle an Anti-Matter being that was threatening both Earths in Warp-Space after being summoned by Doctor Fate, who had sensed the threat due to the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. As the heroes return they find Green Lantern had placed Grundy and Blockbuster together to occupy them, and the two have knocked the hate out of each other. Grundy is then taken back to his Earth by the Justice Society.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #46-47 (Aug.-Sep. 1966)</ref>\n\nIn his next appearance, Solomon Grundy battles the combined might of both the Justice Society, and later their counterparts the [[Justice League]], nearly to a standstill at Slaughter Swamp, when he develops an affection for a lost alien child who has accidentally been sent to Earth-2 and is dying due to separation from his pet. Having absorbed magic from Doctor Fate and Green Lantern, Grundy is easily able to defeat the combined might of [[Kal-El]], [[Jay Garrick]], [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]], and [[Hal Jordan]], until he is defeated by both Green Lanterns and sealed in Slaughter Swamp. The alien child is finally reunited with his pet and sent back to his own dimension.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #91 (Aug. 1971)</ref>\n\nWhile imprisoned, Grundy incorrectly deduces that the second Green Lantern's Earth must contain a second Solomon Grundy, and crosses over from his Slaughter Swamp prison on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-2]] to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-1]] where he overpowers that Earth's Superman before being tricked and stranded on the moon.<ref>Superman #301 (July-Aug. 1976)</ref>\n\nSolomon Grundy briefly works with the [[Injustice Society]] when [[Fiddler (comics)|the Fiddler]] retrieves Grundy from the moon of Earth-One in order to attack the JSA. The two defeat Hawkman and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] before Grundy is thrown into a cooling volcano by [[Power Girl]] and Kal-L.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #63 (1976)</ref>\n\nGrundy goes on to afflict Green Lantern and his teammates, including the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] who is the first female for whom he develops an affection. After Solomon Grundy is rescued from a [[glacier]] by Alan Scott's daughter, [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], Grundy becomes loyal to her and, for a while, is an ally of [[Infinity, Inc.]] Eventually, this affectionate relationship turns tragic as the villainous Marcie Cooper, a.k.a. [[Harlequin (comics)#Marcie Cooper|Harlequin]] of the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]]'s Injustice Unlimited, uses her illusion powers to disguise herself as Jade. Harlequin manipulates Grundy to attack the members of Infinity Inc., one by one. She convinces him to press the unconscious [[Mister Bones]]' bare hand against [[Sylvester Pemberton|Skyman]]; since Bones's skin constantly exudes a [[cyanide]]-based compound, this quickly leads to Skyman's death. Once Grundy found out that Marcie had duped him, he savagely beat her within an inch of her life. This is the beginning of the end for Infinity Inc., and for Grundy's quasi-heroic career.\n\n==== Earth-One version's history ====\nThe Earth-One Grundy arises when the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] uses an enhanced crystal to [[metabolism|metabolically]] hasten the growth of residual cells left over in the sewers from when the original version had crossed over from Earth-2, which becomes a new, much more bestial version. During a clash with [[Superman]], it is determined that his might is too much for the Man of Steel, so Superman flies the monster to an alien world inhospitable to all save the hardiest life as the zombie propels himself through the air mimicking his one-time adversary.\n\nThis version repeatedly plagues Superman for years until, during an encounter wherein multiple Grundys are spawned, Superman and the [[Swamp Thing]] both encounter the [[cloning|clones]]. Soon, Superman obtains a compound from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] which causes the Grundys to become inert, in effect killing the seemingly unkillable man-thing. Swamp Thing attempts to cry out for Superman to stop, as he believes Grundy to meet the definition of life, but Swamp Thing is unable to express this, due to physical difficulty in speaking. This version of Grundy returns one final time, without explanation, leading a gang in the Earth-One Gotham City. He is apparently destroyed yet again when [[Batman]] tricks the creature into a blast furnace, where it is apparently consumed by the flames.\n\nThis version of Grundy was retroactively erased from history after the revamping of Superman in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\nPost-Crisis, Grundy and a newly disfigured [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] strike up an odd friendship after Dent escapes the slaughterhouse to plot his revenge on [[Carmine Falcone]]. Grundy also appears early in the story while Batman pursues one of the suspects who bombed Dent's house into the sewers during [[Thanksgiving]]. Grundy attacks both of them, but Batman drives him off by blinding him with a shot of mace. Later, as a somewhat humorous twist in The Long Halloween, Batman provides Solomon Grundy with a Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAfter Infinity, Inc. disbands, Solomon Grundy loses his loyalty towards Jade. A clash with Alan Scott and Jade in the pages of ''[[Green Lantern Corps]] Quarterly'' ends with Grundy turning into a statue of petrified wood. The heroes believe the threat of Grundy to have ended once and for all, but they are mistaken. Shortly thereafter, Grundy reappears in Gotham in the pages of ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'', battling Batman once again and killing the female descendant of one of the killers of Cyrus Gold.\n\nGrundy's next major appearance is in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'', lurking in [[Opal City]]'s sewers. [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]] befriends Grundy, who has become innocent and childlike. Grundy also becomes friends with previous Starman [[Mikaal Tomas]], and dies while sacrificing himself to save Jack Knight from being crushed by a collapsing building. When Grundy appears again, he has returned to his malicious persona; the joint efforts of Jack Knight, [[Batman]], Alan Scott, and [[Floronic Man|The Floronic Man]] are needed to stop him.\n\nThe origins of Grundy's [[resurrection]] come from the fact that the [[Parliament of Trees]], a high council of Plant [[Elemental]]s, tried to turn him into the newest Plant Elemental. However, the process was missing one vital piece: fire, as a Plant Elemental cannot be fully created unless it died in flames. Since Grundy's death did not involve fire at all, the process is not complete, and he becomes a sort of half-functional Plant Elemental. Grundy has been seemingly destroyed on several occasions, only to rise from the swamp again in a new incarnation. Each version of Grundy has been somewhat different from the last, depending on the medium used to dispatch him (and the drawing style of the current artist. The original Grundy, for example, had prominent front teeth). Some have been truly evil; some much less so. Some versions are more mindless than others; some are actually moderately intelligent, recalling the literate, well-spoken [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.\n\nGrundy hides out for a time in the Arrowcave, the long abandoned former headquarters of the Emerald Archer, [[Green Arrow]]. While searching for artifacts of his former life, Oliver and his former ward, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy \"Arsenal\" Harper]], stumble onto Grundy's new hideout. The story, \"Grundy No Like Arrows in the Face!\", is found in ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #18. Green Arrow notes that this version seems much more violent, and manages to kill him by choking him with the string to his broken bow (despite the fact that Grundy does not have a heartbeat, functional veins, or need to breathe). In ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #53, \"Solomon's Revenge\", Green Arrow helps Dr. Chrissie Cavendish, a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] employee, who claims she is the great, great granddaughter of the man the monster spawned from, to find and cure him. Her cure warps her into a monster much worse than Grundy. Green Arrow subdues the new monster, and leaves Grundy be. It is not known if Grundy is still using this building.\n\n=== Seven Soldiers of Victory ===\nIn the first issue of Grant Morrison's ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'', Issue #0 of the same name, one of the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp recounts the death of the miserly pedophile, Cyrus Gold, killed at the hands of an enraged mob, but also mentions that Gold could just as easily have been the innocent victim of a misunderstanding, as Slaughter Swamp is a point in space where time means nothing. In the final issue \u2013 ''Seven Soldiers #1'' \u2013 the same Unknown Man punishes another of his group \u2013 the Eighth Man, Zor \u2013 by dressing him in Cyrus Gold's clothing and leaving him for the mob to find, implying that Zor \u2013 an extremely vain character, notable for attempting several times to overthrow the Universe and for having defeated [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] \u2013 would later become the first Solomon Grundy.\n\n=== Infinite Crisis ===\nPrior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Grundy is manipulated by [[Gorilla Grodd]] via mind control into attacking Batman and Superman for [[Lex Luthor|President Luthor]] for the bounty of one billion dollars in ''[[Superman/Batman]]''. Batman is able to stop Grundy. While no specifics are given, Solomon Grundy is also coerced into joining the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. He participates in the final strike against the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. [[Rag Doll (comics)|Ragdoll II]] encounters Grundy in a doorway. Ragdoll's scarred face relates to Grundy, and Grundy goes on to turn against the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. The aftermath of that battle is inconclusive, but Grundy evidently survives, as he was last seen in a murky swamp in ''JSA Classified''. In it, he is convinced by [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] to help [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]], who is in trouble.\n\nAfter helping Icicle free [[Johnny Sorrow]] from [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus']] cosmic key, Grundy stays with the newly formed [[Injustice Society]].\n\nIn ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, Solomon Grundy is seen fighting against the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] in the Battle of Metropolis, until he is vaporized by [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]]'s heat vision, which apparently kills the Blood Pack and destroys Grundy's current incarnation.\n\n=== The Tornado's Path ===\nIn [[Brad Meltzer]]'s ''Justice League of America'', Grundy is reborn with intelligence after being killed in the Battle of Metropolis.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 2) #1-4 (October 2006 \u2013 January 2007)</ref> He is revealed to be the mastermind behind the abduction of [[Red Tornado]]'s robot body (it is revealed he gained this intelligence when he was reborn after being burned by Prime). Grundy expresses a desire to stop his cycle of dying and being reborn and so it appears he enlists the help of Professor Ivo to build him an [[Amazo]] body to live in forever. The Red Tornado kills Grundy with [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado winds, ripping him apart.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 2) #5-6 (February\u2013April 2007)</ref>\n\nHe later appears in the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' mini-series in which he is killed during a battle with [[Parademon]]s. His body, awaiting its inevitable resurrection, is left behind when the villains leave the Hell Planet. However, when the villains exit, Grundy's hand trembles, accompanied with a groaning sound.\n\n=== Blackest Night ===\nIn the one-shot ''Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy'' (March 2009) by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Scott Kolins]], Cyrus Gold returns to life in Slaughter Swamp, as he was prior to becoming Grundy. He returns to Gotham City, but is shot by police after attacking a charity worker. In the police morgue, he transforms into Solomon Grundy. Grundy is once more an unintelligent monster, repeating the opening line of the nursery rhyme. A week later, having retreated to the sewers, he has a fight with [[Killer Croc]]. At the end of the fight, exhausted, he reverts to Cyrus Gold again. He finds himself in front of his own grave, where the [[Phantom Stranger]] tells him he has seven days to undo his curse, as \"There is an unholy night coming, as black as the dead's blood. And it's best if Solomon Grundy was not around for it.\" (A reference to the upcoming ''[[Green Lantern: The Blackest Night|Blackest Night]]'' storyline.)<ref>''Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy'' #1 (March 2009)</ref> Alan Scott serves as his reluctant guide, as the story continues in the ''Solomon Grundy'' miniseries.\n\nIn the count down to Blackest Night, Cyrus Gold was given one week to discover the truth of who murdered him, so he could repent for all of his sins and gain absolution. Alan Scott and the Phantom Stranger were given as his guides throughout the week, while [[Etrigan]] was trying to take him to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]]. Gold had a habit of getting killed. No matter how much damage was done to his body, he resurrected as a complete Solomon Grundy, driven to kill. Eventually it is revealed that Gold committed suicide, meaning he forced the curse of Solomon Grundy on himself. At the end of the series' run we see Grundy reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], and Cyrus Gold in hell.<ref>''Solomon Grundy'' #1-6 (May\u2013October 2009)</ref> Grundy then tracks down and attacks [[Bizarro]], using a past friendship they had to stir up the creature's emotions.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #66 (January 2010)</ref> Bizarro eventually manages to defeat Grundy by flying him into the sun, which completely incinerates him, and the black ring.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #67 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n=== The New 52 ===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Grundy is once again a villain for Alan Scott. First appearing in ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'' #3, Grundy personifies \"The Grey\" life-destroying forces and opposes \"The Green\" forces that choose Alan Scott as their champion. He attacks Washington DC to get Alan's attention. [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]], [[Hawkgirl]], and Green Lantern fight him, but [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]] brings him down temporarily by jumping onto him at giant size. The battle continues until Scott once again exiles Grundy to the moon where neither he nor the \"Grey\" can do any damage.<ref>''Earth 2'' #3</ref>\n\nEventually Grundy's origin was revealed: a slaughterhouse worker in 1898, his wife was raped by his callous foreman, and she killed herself on the job. When the foreman made the workers feed the body to the crocodiles, Grundy snapped, killed his foreman and everyone else in the slaughterhouse, then committed suicide, but apparently something happened immediately afterwards.<ref>''Earth 2'' #15.2: Solomon Grundy</ref>\n\n=== DC Rebirth ===\nThe Prime-Earth Solomon Grundy is introduced in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''. His appearance resembles that of his pre-Flashpoint depictions. Solomon Grundy is pursued by Batman in Gotham City before the former incapacitates him. Grundy recites the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme while being pursued before Batman finished it for him when he defeats Grundy.<ref>'''Batman''' Vol. 3 #2</ref>\n\nDuring \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\" arc, Solomon Grundy is among the villains on Joker's side in his war against Riddler.<ref>''Batman'' Vol. 3 #28. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nSolomon Grundy has superhuman strength and stamina. His strength has varied greatly through the years; for instance, in the Long Halloween story arc, Batman beat Grundy, while at various points his strength is roughly on par with Superman's. He is virtually indestructible and immortal thanks to the elemental energy that imbues his form with pseudo-life. He is nearly invulnerable to physical, magical, and energy attacks and he is not affected by fire or low temperatures. He has proven highly resistant to the effects of the [[Alan Scott|original Green Lantern]]'s power ring (which is attributed to his part-plant essence; originally because he had absorbed plant matter from the swamp, and later because he was a partial \"plant elemental\" like [[Swamp Thing]]).\n\nGrundy possesses a healing factor.<ref>Secret Six: Six Degrees of Devastation</ref> While he has occasionally been destroyed, he has always returned to life sooner or later, though often with different personalities and powers.\n\nWhen it came to ''The New 52'', the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy also possesses powers associated with The Grey.\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Anti-Matter Earth Post-Crisis version ===\nSolomon Grundy had a counterpart on the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s Earth called '''Sir Solomon Grundy''' who was a member of Quizmaster's [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Justice Underground|Justice Underground]].

He is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]]. In this cartoon series, Grundy speaks broken English. This incarnation of Grundy is arguably one of the more \"intelligent\" versions of the character as he is able to carry on a conversation and devise plans of his own. In \"Monolith of Evil\", Grundy reveals he was brought back to life in the swamp by energy from a monolith which is a source of enormous power.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in the ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' animated series, voiced again by Jimmy Weldon. In the episode \"Revenge of Doom\", he and the rest of the Legion of Doom get back together after salvaging the Legion of Doom headquarters from the swamp.\n* Solomon Grundy appeared in the DCAU.\n** Solomon Grundy appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version's origin was that of a mobster (also named Cyrus Gold) who eventually crossed the wrong people. He was killed, cursed, then dumped in a mystical swamp, rising again 25 years later as a soulless monster, forever seeking his lost soul without being aware of it. He is often paired with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] to [[comedic]] timing in various episodes and a member of the [[Injustice Gang]] led by either [[Lex Luthor]] in \"Injustice for All\" and [[Fury (DC Comics)|Arseia]] in \"Fury\". In the episode \"The Terror Beyond\", Grundy became a more sympathetic figure, even a hero of sorts, by helping [[Doctor Fate]] save the world from a monstrous, bloodthirsty, [[Thanagar]]ian deity named Ichthultu (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]]ian [[Cthulhu]]) that he calls \"Snake-Face\". He befriends [[Hawkgirl]], calling her \"Bird-Nose\". Fate's team in the episode is a pastiche of Marvel's [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], with Grundy standing in for the [[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]], [[Aquaman]] standing in for [[Namor]], Doctor Fate standing in for [[Doctor Strange]], and Hawkgirl standing in for both [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]]. \"Bird-Nose\" was Hulk's nickname for Nighthawk, and other heroes have referred to him as such. Grundy often says \"Grundy Crush!\", a nod to the Hulk's popular catchphrase \"Hulk Smash!\" (to which Hawkgirl herself alludes with her own \"Hawkgirl Smash\"). Grundy attacks Ichthultu on his own, under the impression that the soul-devouring monster is in possession of his lost soul. He is poisoned in the attempt, but his efforts allow Hawkgirl to kill the monster. Even the normally staunch Hawkgirl weeps for him, and comforts him in his last moments, assuring him that his soul is waiting for him when he dies. His [[epitaph]] simply reads \"Solomon Grundy \u2014 Born on a Monday\", a reference to the poem after which he was named.\n** Solomon would later return in the episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series, \"Wake the Dead\" with his vocal effects provided by [[Bruce Timm]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> He is [[resurrection|resurrected]] by a dark spell cast by a group of young amateurs. The chaos magic used inadvertently infused him with the spirit of an unnamed powerful demon lord when the magic circle used to bind the demon in place was accidentally broken, allowing the demon to escape and possess Grundy's remains, with his memory of his past incarnation severely addled and lacking the ability to speak. Mindless and uncontrollable, he goes on a destructive rampage, his power augmented to levels far beyond his original self by the magic animating him. After a lengthy battle with the Justice League, he regains a small fraction of his memory when he beholds Shayera Hol, whom he has accepted as a friend, and he submits to Shayera who sorrowfully kills him offscreen to put him out of his misery.\n* Solomon Grundy appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Kevin Grevioux]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is a zombie created by the working class citizens of 19th century [[Gotham City]] to wreak havoc on the rich landowners that polluted the local lake with [[industrial waste]] that converted it into Gotham Swamp, and is slimmer and more ghoulish than his ''Justice League'' counterpart \u2014 it bears a closer resemblance to an actually rotted, desiccated corpse \u2014 and he is more of a villain tied to Batman due to being 'born' in Gotham. As seen in the episode \"Grundy's Night\", the local legend had it that Grundy would again arise on a [[Halloween]] night when there was a total lunar eclipse in order to take revenge on the descendants of the rich landowners. Gotham City residents therefore referred to this Halloween as 'Grundy's Night', however, it was actually [[Clayface]] in disguise. Though at the end of the episode, something begins to rise out of the swamp as a moan is heard.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is a still a zombie, but also a crime lord (a combination of the intelligent and incompetent versions) who commands a group of thugs, but speaks in grunts and growls due to his mouth being stitched together. He is also shown to have a right-hand man named Weasel that understands his orders. He fights against Batman and [[Black Canary]] in the teaser of \"Night of the Huntress\" where he tries to steal a scientist's brain. Black Canary defeats him by fooling him into falling through a glass roof atop a building. He reappears in \"The Color of Revenge\" robbing a bank in [[Bludhaven]]. [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] stops Grundy and the police take him away. He is also one of the villains summoned very briefly by [[Bat-Mite]] to test Batman's mettle in \"Legends of the Dark Mite\". He also appears in \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\" as one of the [[List of Batman Family enemies|Batman Villains]] to bid on a weapon auctioned by [[Joe Chill]]. Solomon is later seen in \"The Knights of Tomorrow\" being defeated by both Batman and Robin from the past and the future. He also appears in \"Night of the Batmen\" where he, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and [[Killer Croc]] try to steal a statue, but all four were stopped by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] dressed as Batman.

He tried to make a joke about Batman, but was cut off by Joker due to his inability to speak clearly.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in the fifth ''[[DC Nation Shorts|Super Best Friends Forever]]'' short, voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]. When he begins rampaging the city, Supergirl, Batgirl, and Wonder Girl show up to stop him. He is reluctant to fight them because he says he does not fight girls, but when they defeat him, Grundy starts to reconsider fighting girls.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> In \"Zombie King\", he has obtained a gem that would enable him to summon zombies that would obey his every command. In addition, the zombies Solomon Grundy summons would turn anyone exposed to their gases into zombies as well. This plot was stumbled upon by Swamp Thing who fights Solomon Grundy and his zombies in a New Orleans graveyard. In need of backup against Solomon Grundy and the zombies, Swamp-Thing calls Batman for help. As Swamp Thing and Batman fight Solomon Grundy's zombies as he places the gem into an altar in order to raise more zombies throughout the world, they soon are aided by Zatanna while John Constantine is busy fighting [[Brother Night]]. Even though Batman and Zatanna get converted into zombies, Swamp-Thing managed to break the altar and the gem enough for the zombified people to be returned to normal and the zombies to go inert. Then Swamp Thing manages to defeat Solomon Grundy. In \"E. Nigma, Consulting Detective\", the Riddler enters Grundy's cell to search for a clue left by the Joker. Though Grundy is initially hostile, Riddler is able to appease Grundy by offering him something to alleviate his boredom: a [[Chinese finger trap]]. In \"Party Animal\" Solomon Grundy is defeated by Green Arrow and Plastic Man while on a rampage during [[Christmas]]. Since S.T.A.R. Labs was holding a Christmas party, Plastic Man takes Grundy to the League's Christmas party until he can be put in a holding cell.

He is a [[boss battle]] and appears in the basement of the new Iceberg Lounge (which is located in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute) as the Penguin's \"pet\" who Cobblepot uses to kill his disloyal grunts. His origin story is related through several Arkham Stories: Solomon Grundy was once a merchant who was murdered and his body dumped in a mystic swamp. That night he was resurrected by combination of the swamp's mystic properties and a strange thunderstorm which turned him into the creature known as Solomon Grundy. He was found by a traveling circus and became part of the show before being found by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who realized that Grundy had actually been dumped in a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Ra's sought to understand the properties of the Lazarus Pit and its powers, and did so by repeatedly murdering Grundy, only for him to rise again and again. After Wonder City was shut down the Gotham forces sent to retrieve found Grundy, still in the building Ra's kept him in, waiting for Ra's to kill him again.

He was originally depicted as a murder victim brought back to life as a corporeal [[revenant]] or zombie, though subsequent versions of the character have occasionally depicted a different origin. He is named after the 19th century nursery rhyme \"[[Solomon Grundy (nursery rhyme)|Solomon Grundy]]\".\n\nGrundy was introduced as an enemy of comic book hero [[Alan Scott]] (the original [[Green Lantern]]), but has since become a prominent enemy for a number of superheroes such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]], the Green Lantern, and [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]. He also has ties to [[Swamp Thing]].\n\nCyrus Gold debuted in the [[Arrow (season 2)|second]] season of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' portrayed by Graham Shiels. This version never became a zombie but was instead injected with a serum. The character renamed Butch Gilzean a mob enforcer appeared in 2014 on Fox's television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Drew Powell]]. In the later seasons the character was revealed to be Cyrus Gold who eventually became a zombie.\n\n== Publication history ==\nCreated by [[Alfred Bester]],<ref>''Green Lantern'' #223</ref> he first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #61 (October 1944).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=276}}</ref>\n\nGrundy is the focus of one of the four ''[[Faces of Evil]]'' one-shots that explore the aftermath of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', written by [[Scott Kolins]] and [[Geoff Johns]], with art by [[Shane Davis]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/110803-kolins-Grundy.html Scott Kolins on Faces of Evil: Grundy], [[Newsarama]], November 3, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/php/multimedia/album.php?aid=24126 Exclusive Preview: Faces of Evil: Grundy], [[Newsarama]], 13 November 2008.</ref> It is the introduction to a seven part mini-series featuring the character\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n=== Pre-Crisis ===\n==== Earth-Two version's history ====\n[[File:All American Comics 61.jpg|The cover to ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #61, by Paul Reinman.|thumb|left]]\nIn the late 19th century, a wealthy merchant named Cyrus Gold is murdered and his body is disposed of in Slaughter Swamp, near [[Gotham City]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=111}}</ref> Fifty years later, the corpse is reanimated as a huge shambling figure (composed partly of the [[swamp]] matter that has accumulated around the body over the decades) with almost no memory of its past life. Gold murders two escaped criminals who are hiding out in the marsh and steals their clothes. He shows up in a [[hobo]] camp and, when asked about his name, one of the few things he can recall is that he was \"born on a Monday\". One of the men at the camp mentions the nursery rhyme character [[Solomon Grundy (nursery rhyme)|Solomon Grundy]] (who was born on a Monday), and Gold adopts the moniker.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=170-171}}</ref>\n\nStrong, vicious, and nearly mindless, Solomon Grundy falls into a life of crime\u2014or perhaps returns to one, as his scattered residual memories may indicate\u2014attracting the attention of the Green Lantern, [[Alan Scott]]. Grundy proves to be a difficult opponent, unkillable (since he is already dead) and with an inherent resistance to Scott's powers (which cannot affect [[wood]], a substance of which Grundy's reassembled body is now largely composed). He apparently kills Green Lantern, who gives off a green flash. Liking this flash, Grundy commits murders hoping to see the flash again. However the first fight ends when, engaging in fisticuffs with the monster because of the ineffectiveness of his ring, Grundy is hurled under a [[train]] by Green Lantern.\n\nGrundy is revived when a criminal scientist, known as the [[Professor]], injects Grundy with concentrated chlorophyll.{{Issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter this second encounter, Grundy is trapped in a green plasma bubble for a time, until a freak weather occurrence releases him from his prison. Making his way across country, Grundy heads for the headquarters of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Green Lantern arrives early for the meeting and when the other members arrive, they find their headquarters smashed to pieces and Green Lantern missing from the ranks. Johnny turns on the radio, which blares the warning that Solomon Grundy is on the loose; the members believe, based on a large, muddy footprint on the floor, that Grundy got to HQ and took Green Lantern. The radio continues its report, listing cities where Grundy was seen, so each member picks a city and heads for it (Wonder Woman staying behind) to try to find Green Lantern. The scene now shifts back to the moment at JSA HQ where Green Lantern had opened the door. To his surprise, [[Doiby Dickles]] walks in, and informs him that Grundy has freed himself and is on the loose. Green Lantern leaves immediately, hoping to find Grundy before any of the JSA members are hurt going after him. Minutes later, Grundy arrives at JSA HQ, and, not finding the Lantern there, he smashes the place up, then leaves. Green Lantern and Doiby use a special radio-like device Alan Scott had developed that is attuned to the mental wavelengths of Grundy himself; Green Lantern calculates the path of Grundy and announces over the radio in JSA HQ where Grundy will strike. When Green Lantern and Grundy meet, Grundy rips a tree out by its roots and smashes it into the Lantern. Green Lantern fights back with his power ring and fists until both men fall into a nearby stream and over a small waterfall. The Lantern is severely dazed and tries to ward off Grundy with his ring, but he is much too weak. Grundy grabs Green Lantern by the throat and begins to squeeze the life out of him, holding his head underwater. However, Hawkman strikes Grundy with his mace, and Mid-Nite is able to revive the Lantern. A combined attack brings down Grundy, and Green Lantern deposits Grundy on a distant, lifeless planet.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #33 (1947)</ref>\n\nA battle soon commences when Grundy's body gravitates towards young astronomer Dick Cashmere as he learns to ride light waves, resulting in his assuming Cashmere's identity for a time while leaving the real one bound and gagged, though the Society finds him soon after. In this incarnation he gains intelligence, which he subsequently loses when Green Lantern defeats and buries Grundy in 1947.\n\nAt this point, Grundy is freed and enlisted along with several other supervillains by the time-traveling criminal [[Per Degaton]] in his second appearance, who has traveled to 1941 to capture the Justice Society of America on the day of the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], hoping to change history and take over the world. Grundy encounters Green Lantern, the Flash, and Wonder Woman in Echo Park, whom Grundy knows from 1947. Grundy bests the costumed trio, and is summoned by a mysterious voice to deliver them or \"pay the penalty\". The [[All-Star Squadron]] comes to their rescue, [[Shining Knight#Sir Justin|Sir Justin]] faces off against Solomon Grundy and Grundy is the last villain to be transported back, he is thrust back to the moon where he remains for over two decades, as this timeline is erased once Degaton is defeated.<ref>''All-Star Squadron'' #1-3 (Sep.-Oct. 1981)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #183 (1981)</ref>\n\nAfter many years, Grundy is knocked loose from his planet prison and returns to Earth to battle Green Lantern, [[Hourman]], and [[Doctor Fate]]. At this point, he has temporary mastery over all wooden objects. He is imprisoned orbiting the Earth in a stronger bubble created by the combined powers of Green Lantern and Doctor Fate.<ref>''Showcase'' #55 (Mar-Apr. 1965)</ref>\n\nGrundy was once pulled to Earth-1 and substituted for the superstrong [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] due to a machine that was accidentally pulling the Earths together in warp-space and substituting people. During this event he had absorbed some of Dr Fate's magic, is stronger than before, and is even able to telekinetically lift the Flash into the air. He hates Green Lantern so much he thinks everyone he sees is Green Lantern. He is imprisoned inside a mountain by Earth-1 Green Lantern after being lifted up by Earth-1 [[Hawkman]] and dazed by blows from all the heroes, but when the machine is turned off he is substituted for Blockbuster on Earth-2 and renews the attack, defeating numerous heroes. However the JSA and JLA went to battle an Anti-Matter being that was threatening both Earths in Warp-Space after being summoned by Doctor Fate, who had sensed the threat due to the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. As the heroes return they find Green Lantern had placed Grundy and Blockbuster together to occupy them, and the two have knocked the hate out of each other. Grundy is then taken back to his Earth by the Justice Society.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #46-47 (Aug.-Sep. 1966)</ref>\n\nIn his next appearance, Solomon Grundy battles the combined might of both the Justice Society, and later their counterparts the [[Justice League]], nearly to a standstill at Slaughter Swamp, when he develops an affection for a lost alien child who has accidentally been sent to Earth-2 and is dying due to separation from his pet. Having absorbed magic from Doctor Fate and Green Lantern, Grundy is easily able to defeat the combined might of [[Kal-El]], [[Jay Garrick]], [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]], and [[Hal Jordan]], until he is defeated by both Green Lanterns and sealed in Slaughter Swamp. The alien child is finally reunited with his pet and sent back to his own dimension.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #91 (Aug. 1971)</ref>\n\nWhile imprisoned, Grundy incorrectly deduces that the second Green Lantern's Earth must contain a second Solomon Grundy, and crosses over from his Slaughter Swamp prison on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-2]] to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-1]] where he overpowers that Earth's Superman before being tricked and stranded on the moon.<ref>Superman #301 (July-Aug. 1976)</ref>\n\nSolomon Grundy briefly works with the [[Injustice Society]] when [[Fiddler (comics)|the Fiddler]] retrieves Grundy from the moon of Earth-One in order to attack the JSA. The two defeat Hawkman and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] before Grundy is thrown into a cooling volcano by [[Power Girl]] and Kal-L.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #63 (1976)</ref>\n\nGrundy goes on to afflict Green Lantern and his teammates, including the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] who is the first female for whom he develops an affection. After Solomon Grundy is rescued from a [[glacier]] by Alan Scott's daughter, [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], Grundy becomes loyal to her and, for a while, is an ally of [[Infinity, Inc.]] Eventually, this affectionate relationship turns tragic as the villainous Marcie Cooper, a.k.a. [[Harlequin (comics)#Marcie Cooper|Harlequin]] of the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]]'s Injustice Unlimited, uses her illusion powers to disguise herself as Jade. Harlequin manipulates Grundy to attack the members of Infinity Inc., one by one. She convinces him to press the unconscious [[Mister Bones]]' bare hand against [[Sylvester Pemberton|Skyman]]; since Bones's skin constantly exudes a [[cyanide]]-based compound, this quickly leads to Skyman's death. Once Grundy found out that Marcie had duped him, he savagely beat her within an inch of her life. This is the beginning of the end for Infinity Inc., and for Grundy's quasi-heroic career.\n\n==== Earth-One version's history ====\nThe Earth-One Grundy arises when the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] uses an enhanced crystal to [[metabolism|metabolically]] hasten the growth of residual cells left over in the sewers from when the original version had crossed over from Earth-2, which becomes a new, much more bestial version. During a clash with [[Superman]], it is determined that his might is too much for the Man of Steel, so Superman flies the monster to an alien world inhospitable to all save the hardiest life as the zombie propels himself through the air mimicking his one-time adversary.\n\nThis version repeatedly plagues Superman for years until, during an encounter wherein multiple Grundys are spawned, Superman and the [[Swamp Thing]] both encounter the [[cloning|clones]]. Soon, Superman obtains a compound from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] which causes the Grundys to become inert, in effect killing the seemingly unkillable man-thing. Swamp Thing attempts to cry out for Superman to stop, as he believes Grundy to meet the definition of life, but Swamp Thing is unable to express this, due to physical difficulty in speaking. This version of Grundy returns one final time, without explanation, leading a gang in the Earth-One Gotham City. He is apparently destroyed yet again when [[Batman]] tricks the creature into a blast furnace, where it is apparently consumed by the flames.\n\nThis version of Grundy was retroactively erased from history after the revamping of Superman in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\nPost-Crisis, Grundy and a newly disfigured [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] strike up an odd friendship after Dent escapes the slaughterhouse to plot his revenge on [[Carmine Falcone]]. Grundy also appears early in the story while Batman pursues one of the suspects who bombed Dent's house into the sewers during [[Thanksgiving]]. Grundy attacks both of them, but Batman drives him off by blinding him with a shot of mace. Later, as a somewhat humorous twist in The Long Halloween, Batman provides Solomon Grundy with a Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAfter Infinity, Inc. disbands, Solomon Grundy loses his loyalty towards Jade. A clash with Alan Scott and Jade in the pages of ''[[Green Lantern Corps]] Quarterly'' ends with Grundy turning into a statue of petrified wood. The heroes believe the threat of Grundy to have ended once and for all, but they are mistaken. Shortly thereafter, Grundy reappears in Gotham in the pages of ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'', battling Batman once again and killing the female descendant of one of the killers of Cyrus Gold.\n\nGrundy's next major appearance is in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'', lurking in [[Opal City]]'s sewers. [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]] befriends Grundy, who has become innocent and childlike. Grundy also becomes friends with previous Starman [[Mikaal Tomas]], and dies while sacrificing himself to save Jack Knight from being crushed by a collapsing building. When Grundy appears again, he has returned to his malicious persona; the joint efforts of Jack Knight, [[Batman]], Alan Scott, and [[Floronic Man|The Floronic Man]] are needed to stop him.\n\nThe origins of Grundy's [[resurrection]] come from the fact that the [[Parliament of Trees]], a high council of Plant [[Elemental]]s, tried to turn him into the newest Plant Elemental. However, the process was missing one vital piece: fire, as a Plant Elemental cannot be fully created unless it died in flames. Since Grundy's death did not involve fire at all, the process is not complete, and he becomes a sort of half-functional Plant Elemental. Grundy has been seemingly destroyed on several occasions, only to rise from the swamp again in a new incarnation. Each version of Grundy has been somewhat different from the last, depending on the medium used to dispatch him (and the drawing style of the current artist. The original Grundy, for example, had prominent front teeth). Some have been truly evil; some much less so. Some versions are more mindless than others; some are actually moderately intelligent, recalling the literate, well-spoken [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.\n\nGrundy hides out for a time in the Arrowcave, the long abandoned former headquarters of the Emerald Archer, [[Green Arrow]]. While searching for artifacts of his former life, Oliver and his former ward, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy \"Arsenal\" Harper]], stumble onto Grundy's new hideout. The story, \"Grundy No Like Arrows in the Face!\", is found in ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #18. Green Arrow notes that this version seems much more violent, and manages to kill him by choking him with the string to his broken bow (despite the fact that Grundy does not have a heartbeat, functional veins, or need to breathe). In ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #53, \"Solomon's Revenge\", Green Arrow helps Dr. Chrissie Cavendish, a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] employee, who claims she is the great, great granddaughter of the man the monster spawned from, to find and cure him. Her cure warps her into a monster much worse than Grundy. Green Arrow subdues the new monster, and leaves Grundy be. It is not known if Grundy is still using this building.\n\n=== Seven Soldiers of Victory ===\nIn the first issue of Grant Morrison's ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'', Issue #0 of the same name, one of the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp recounts the death of the miserly pedophile, Cyrus Gold, killed at the hands of an enraged mob, but also mentions that Gold could just as easily have been the innocent victim of a misunderstanding, as Slaughter Swamp is a point in space where time means nothing. In the final issue \u2013 ''Seven Soldiers #1'' \u2013 the same Unknown Man punishes another of his group \u2013 the Eighth Man, Zor \u2013 by dressing him in Cyrus Gold's clothing and leaving him for the mob to find, implying that Zor \u2013 an extremely vain character, notable for attempting several times to overthrow the Universe and for having defeated [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] \u2013 would later become the first Solomon Grundy.\n\n=== Infinite Crisis ===\nPrior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Grundy is manipulated by [[Gorilla Grodd]] via mind control into attacking Batman and Superman for [[Lex Luthor|President Luthor]] for the bounty of one billion dollars in ''[[Superman/Batman]]''. Batman is able to stop Grundy. While no specifics are given, Solomon Grundy is also coerced into joining the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. He participates in the final strike against the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. [[Rag Doll (comics)|Ragdoll II]] encounters Grundy in a doorway. Ragdoll's scarred face relates to Grundy, and Grundy goes on to turn against the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. The aftermath of that battle is inconclusive, but Grundy evidently survives, as he was last seen in a murky swamp in ''JSA Classified''. In it, he is convinced by [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] to help [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]], who is in trouble.\n\nAfter helping Icicle free [[Johnny Sorrow]] from [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus']] cosmic key, Grundy stays with the newly formed [[Injustice Society]].\n\nIn ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, Solomon Grundy is seen fighting against the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] in the Battle of Metropolis, until he is vaporized by [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]]'s heat vision, which apparently kills the Blood Pack and destroys Grundy's current incarnation.\n\n=== The Tornado's Path ===\nIn [[Brad Meltzer]]'s ''Justice League of America'', Grundy is reborn with intelligence after being killed in the Battle of Metropolis.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 2) #1-4 (October 2006 \u2013 January 2007)</ref> He is revealed to be the mastermind behind the abduction of [[Red Tornado]]'s robot body (it is revealed he gained this intelligence when he was reborn after being burned by Prime). Grundy expresses a desire to stop his cycle of dying and being reborn and so it appears he enlists the help of Professor Ivo to build him an [[Amazo]] body to live in forever. The Red Tornado kills Grundy with [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado winds, ripping him apart.<ref>''Justice League America'' (vol. 2) #5-6 (February\u2013April 2007)</ref>\n\nHe later appears in the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' mini-series in which he is killed during a battle with [[Parademon]]s. His body, awaiting its inevitable resurrection, is left behind when the villains leave the Hell Planet. However, when the villains exit, Grundy's hand trembles, accompanied with a groaning sound.\n\n=== Blackest Night ===\nIn the one-shot ''Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy'' (March 2009) by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Scott Kolins]], Cyrus Gold returns to life in Slaughter Swamp, as he was prior to becoming Grundy. He returns to Gotham City, but is shot by police after attacking a charity worker. In the police morgue, he transforms into Solomon Grundy. Grundy is once more an unintelligent monster, repeating the opening line of the nursery rhyme. A week later, having retreated to the sewers, he has a fight with [[Killer Croc]]. At the end of the fight, exhausted, he reverts to Cyrus Gold again. He finds himself in front of his own grave, where the [[Phantom Stranger]] tells him he has seven days to undo his curse, as \"There is an unholy night coming, as black as the dead's blood. And it's best if Solomon Grundy was not around for it.\" (A reference to the upcoming ''[[Green Lantern: The Blackest Night|Blackest Night]]'' storyline.)<ref>''Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy'' #1 (March 2009)</ref> Alan Scott serves as his reluctant guide, as the story continues in the ''Solomon Grundy'' miniseries.\n\nIn the count down to Blackest Night, Cyrus Gold was given one week to discover the truth of who murdered him, so he could repent for all of his sins and gain absolution. Alan Scott and the Phantom Stranger were given as his guides throughout the week, while [[Etrigan]] was trying to take him to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]]. Gold had a habit of getting killed. No matter how much damage was done to his body, he resurrected as a complete Solomon Grundy, driven to kill. Eventually it is revealed that Gold committed suicide, meaning he forced the curse of Solomon Grundy on himself. At the end of the series' run we see Grundy reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], and Cyrus Gold in hell.<ref>''Solomon Grundy'' #1-6 (May\u2013October 2009)</ref> Grundy then tracks down and attacks [[Bizarro]], using a past friendship they had to stir up the creature's emotions.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #66 (January 2010)</ref> Bizarro eventually manages to defeat Grundy by flying him into the sun, which completely incinerates him, and the black ring.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #67 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n=== The New 52 ===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Grundy is once again a villain for Alan Scott. First appearing in ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'' #3, Grundy personifies \"The Grey\" life-destroying forces and opposes \"The Green\" forces that choose Alan Scott as their champion. He attacks Washington DC to get Alan's attention. [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]], [[Hawkgirl]], and Green Lantern fight him, but [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]] brings him down temporarily by jumping onto him at giant size. The battle continues until Scott once again exiles Grundy to the moon where neither he nor the \"Grey\" can do any damage.<ref>''Earth 2'' #3</ref>\n\nEventually Grundy's origin was revealed: a slaughterhouse worker in 1898, his wife was raped by his callous foreman, and she killed herself on the job. When the foreman made the workers feed the body to the crocodiles, Grundy snapped, killed his foreman and everyone else in the slaughterhouse, then committed suicide, but apparently something happened immediately afterwards.<ref>''Earth 2'' #15.2: Solomon Grundy</ref>\n\n=== DC Rebirth ===\nThe Prime-Earth Solomon Grundy is introduced in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''. His appearance resembles that of his pre-Flashpoint depictions. Solomon Grundy is pursued by Batman in Gotham City before the former incapacitates him. Grundy recites the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme while being pursued before Batman finished it for him when he defeats Grundy.<ref>'''Batman''' Vol. 3 #2</ref>\n\nDuring \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\" arc, Solomon Grundy is among the villains on Joker's side in his war against Riddler.<ref>''Batman'' Vol. 3 #28. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nSolomon Grundy has superhuman strength and stamina. His strength has varied greatly through the years; for instance, in the Long Halloween story arc, Batman beat Grundy, while at various points his strength is roughly on par with Superman's. He is virtually indestructible and immortal thanks to the elemental energy that imbues his form with pseudo-life. He is nearly invulnerable to physical, magical, and energy attacks and he is not affected by fire or low temperatures. He has proven highly resistant to the effects of the [[Alan Scott|original Green Lantern]]'s power ring (which is attributed to his part-plant essence; originally because he had absorbed plant matter from the swamp, and later because he was a partial \"plant elemental\" like [[Swamp Thing]]).\n\nGrundy possesses a healing factor.<ref>Secret Six: Six Degrees of Devastation</ref> While he has occasionally been destroyed, he has always returned to life sooner or later, though often with different personalities and powers.\n\nWhen it came to ''The New 52'', the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy also possesses powers associated with The Grey.\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Anti-Matter Earth Post-Crisis version ===\nSolomon Grundy had a counterpart on the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s Earth called '''Sir Solomon Grundy''' who was a member of Quizmaster's [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Justice Underground|Justice Underground]]. Sir Solomon Grundy is a distinguished, poised mountain of a man. During an aerial bombardment of Dover, he is blasted to life out of the rock from the [[White cliffs of Dover|white cliffs]]. Sir Solomon appears to be identical in physical appearance to the mainstream Solomon Grundy with the exception of a trimmed mustache and a small goatee. In keeping with his educated personality, Sir Solomon dresses himself as a 19th-century Englishman would, and speaks accordingly. His super strength and invulnerability made him a formidable hero, until [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] renders him inert on a Saturday.<ref>''JLA Secret Files and Origins 2004''</ref>\n\n=== Amalgam Comics ===\n'''The Skulk''' is a hero of the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam]] Universe. He is an amalgamation of Solomon Grundy and [[Hulk|the Hulk]].\n\nBruce Banner was a scientist working with gamma rays. He was testing his gamma bomb out in the desert, but a tall figure walked out into the testing area. When Banner went out see who it was, the man turned out to be Solomon Grundy. The bomb went off fusing Grundy and Banner together. When Banner gets angry, he becomes Grundy.

A tie-in novel reveals that Gold was a preacher in the orphanage where Blood was raised with the two later joining the Church under its founder Roger Trigon.

He is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]]. In this cartoon series, Grundy speaks broken English. This incarnation of Grundy is arguably one of the more \"intelligent\" versions of the character as he is able to carry on a conversation and devise plans of his own. In \"Monolith of Evil\", Grundy reveals he was brought back to life in the swamp by energy from a monolith which is a source of enormous power.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in the ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' animated series, voiced again by Jimmy Weldon. In the episode \"Revenge of Doom\", he and the rest of the Legion of Doom get back together after salvaging the Legion of Doom headquarters from the swamp.\n* Solomon Grundy appeared in the DCAU.\n** Solomon Grundy appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version's origin was that of a mobster (also named Cyrus Gold) who eventually crossed the wrong people. He was killed, cursed, then dumped in a mystical swamp, rising again 25 years later as a soulless monster, forever seeking his lost soul without being aware of it. He is often paired with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] to [[comedic]] timing in various episodes and a member of the [[Injustice Gang]] led by either [[Lex Luthor]] in \"Injustice for All\" and [[Fury (DC Comics)|Arseia]] in \"Fury\". In the episode \"The Terror Beyond\", Grundy became a more sympathetic figure, even a hero of sorts, by helping [[Doctor Fate]] save the world from a monstrous, bloodthirsty, [[Thanagar]]ian deity named Ichthultu (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]]ian [[Cthulhu]]) that he calls \"Snake-Face\". He befriends [[Hawkgirl]], calling her \"Bird-Nose\". Fate's team in the episode is a pastiche of Marvel's [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], with Grundy standing in for the [[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]], [[Aquaman]] standing in for [[Namor]], Doctor Fate standing in for [[Doctor Strange]], and Hawkgirl standing in for both [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]]. \"Bird-Nose\" was Hulk's nickname for Nighthawk, and other heroes have referred to him as such. Grundy often says \"Grundy Crush!\", a nod to the Hulk's popular catchphrase \"Hulk Smash!\" (to which Hawkgirl herself alludes with her own \"Hawkgirl Smash\"). Grundy attacks Ichthultu on his own, under the impression that the soul-devouring monster is in possession of his lost soul. He is poisoned in the attempt, but his efforts allow Hawkgirl to kill the monster. Even the normally staunch Hawkgirl weeps for him, and comforts him in his last moments, assuring him that his soul is waiting for him when he dies. His [[epitaph]] simply reads \"Solomon Grundy \u2014 Born on a Monday\", a reference to the poem after which he was named.\n** Solomon would later return in the episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series, \"Wake the Dead\" with his vocal effects provided by [[Bruce Timm]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> He is [[resurrection|resurrected]] by a dark spell cast by a group of young amateurs. The chaos magic used inadvertently infused him with the spirit of an unnamed powerful demon lord when the magic circle used to bind the demon in place was accidentally broken, allowing the demon to escape and possess Grundy's remains, with his memory of his past incarnation severely addled and lacking the ability to speak. Mindless and uncontrollable, he goes on a destructive rampage, his power augmented to levels far beyond his original self by the magic animating him. After a lengthy battle with the Justice League, he regains a small fraction of his memory when he beholds Shayera Hol, whom he has accepted as a friend, and he submits to Shayera who sorrowfully kills him offscreen to put him out of his misery.\n* Solomon Grundy appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Kevin Grevioux]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is a zombie created by the working class citizens of 19th century [[Gotham City]] to wreak havoc on the rich landowners that polluted the local lake with [[industrial waste]] that converted it into Gotham Swamp, and is slimmer and more ghoulish than his ''Justice League'' counterpart \u2014 it bears a closer resemblance to an actually rotted, desiccated corpse \u2014 and he is more of a villain tied to Batman due to being 'born' in Gotham. As seen in the episode \"Grundy's Night\", the local legend had it that Grundy would again arise on a [[Halloween]] night when there was a total lunar eclipse in order to take revenge on the descendants of the rich landowners. Gotham City residents therefore referred to this Halloween as 'Grundy's Night', however, it was actually [[Clayface]] in disguise. Though at the end of the episode, something begins to rise out of the swamp as a moan is heard.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is a still a zombie, but also a crime lord (a combination of the intelligent and incompetent versions) who commands a group of thugs, but speaks in grunts and growls due to his mouth being stitched together. He is also shown to have a right-hand man named Weasel that understands his orders. He fights against Batman and [[Black Canary]] in the teaser of \"Night of the Huntress\" where he tries to steal a scientist's brain. Black Canary defeats him by fooling him into falling through a glass roof atop a building. He reappears in \"The Color of Revenge\" robbing a bank in [[Bludhaven]]. [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] stops Grundy and the police take him away. He is also one of the villains summoned very briefly by [[Bat-Mite]] to test Batman's mettle in \"Legends of the Dark Mite\". He also appears in \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\" as one of the [[List of Batman Family enemies|Batman Villains]] to bid on a weapon auctioned by [[Joe Chill]]. Solomon is later seen in \"The Knights of Tomorrow\" being defeated by both Batman and Robin from the past and the future. He also appears in \"Night of the Batmen\" where he, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and [[Killer Croc]] try to steal a statue, but all four were stopped by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] dressed as Batman. He was also seen in \"Powerless\" where he is one of the villains in a training simulator to help the depowered [[Captain Atom]] fight crime without powers were taken away by [[Major Force]]. Unfortunately, unable to defeat the simulation of Grundy. Solomon is also seen in the opening of \"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth\", as one of the villains at the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s [[celebrity roast]], where they were literally roasting Batman. He tried to make a joke about Batman, but was cut off by Joker due to his inability to speak clearly.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in the fifth ''[[DC Nation Shorts|Super Best Friends Forever]]'' short, voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]. When he begins rampaging the city, Supergirl, Batgirl, and Wonder Girl show up to stop him. He is reluctant to fight them because he says he does not fight girls, but when they defeat him, Grundy starts to reconsider fighting girls.\n* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> In \"Zombie King\", he has obtained a gem that would enable him to summon zombies that would obey his every command. In addition, the zombies Solomon Grundy summons would turn anyone exposed to their gases into zombies as well. This plot was stumbled upon by Swamp Thing who fights Solomon Grundy and his zombies in a New Orleans graveyard. In need of backup against Solomon Grundy and the zombies, Swamp-Thing calls Batman for help. As Swamp Thing and Batman fight Solomon Grundy's zombies as he places the gem into an altar in order to raise more zombies throughout the world, they soon are aided by Zatanna while John Constantine is busy fighting [[Brother Night]]. Even though Batman and Zatanna get converted into zombies, Swamp-Thing managed to break the altar and the gem enough for the zombified people to be returned to normal and the zombies to go inert. Then Swamp Thing manages to defeat Solomon Grundy. In \"E. Nigma, Consulting Detective\", the Riddler enters Grundy's cell to search for a clue left by the Joker. Though Grundy is initially hostile, Riddler is able to appease Grundy by offering him something to alleviate his boredom: a [[Chinese finger trap]]. In \"Party Animal\" Solomon Grundy is defeated by Green Arrow and Plastic Man while on a rampage during [[Christmas]]. Since S.T.A.R. Labs was holding a Christmas party, Plastic Man takes Grundy to the League's Christmas party until he can be put in a holding cell. When Grundy sees on the news he scared a little girl during his rampage, he breaks out and fights the Justice League until he finds the little girl, and he gives her a teddy bear as a gift and apologizes for scaring her.\n\n=== Film ===\n* Solomon Grundy appears in the animated movie ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', voiced by [[Corey Burton]] (albeit uncredited).

He is a [[boss battle]] and appears in the basement of the new Iceberg Lounge (which is located in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute) as the Penguin's \"pet\" who Cobblepot uses to kill his disloyal grunts. His origin story is related through several Arkham Stories: Solomon Grundy was once a merchant who was murdered and his body dumped in a mystic swamp. That night he was resurrected by combination of the swamp's mystic properties and a strange thunderstorm which turned him into the creature known as Solomon Grundy. He was found by a traveling circus and became part of the show before being found by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who realized that Grundy had actually been dumped in a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Ra's sought to understand the properties of the Lazarus Pit and its powers, and did so by repeatedly murdering Grundy, only for him to rise again and again. After Wonder City was shut down the Gotham forces sent to retrieve found Grundy, still in the building Ra's kept him in, waiting for Ra's to kill him again. Batman later confronts Grundy when Penguin blows up the floor under his feet. Awakened by being shocked with electricity, Grundy was revitalized and proceeded to attack.
