During the 20th century, the town gradually transitioned away from coal, and today its economy is primarily based on forestry and tourism. The town was the filming location for ''[[The Runner Stumbles]]'', ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', and ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]''.

Bullet, vice president of the Northern Pacific Coal Company, at the time that the company initiated the first commercial coal mining operations there, to support railway operations.<ref name=\"BlackPast\">Goodloe, Trevor. \"[http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/roslyn-washington Roslyn, Washington (1886-- )]\". [[BlackPast.org]]. Retrieved 2018-01-19.</ref>\n\nThroughout the mid-1880s, the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], the parent of Northern Pacific Coal Company, pushed from the east to reach [[Puget Sound]] across the [[Cascade Mountains]]. The Northern Pacific began building across [[Stampede Pass]] just west of Roslyn, approaching from [[Wallula, Washington|Wallula]] in the east and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] in the west. A 77-mile (124-km) gap remained in 1886. In January of that year, Nelson Bennett was given a contract to construct a 9,850&nbsp;foot (3,002&nbsp;m) tunnel under Stampede Pass, completing it in 1888. Roslyn, which lies on the route to Stampede Pass, provided the coal for the railway construction work as well as the continuing railroad operations.\n\nBetween 1886 and 1929, immigrant workers from countries such as [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] as well as from [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] came to work in the mines. These immigrants maintained the traditions of their homelands, as seen in the historic Roslyn Cemetery, with its 26 sections for distinct ethnic and lodge cemetery areas. Many Roslyn residents today are descendants of these immigrant miners.\n\nRoslyn's peak coal mine production of nearly 2 million tons was reached in 1910. As coal-fired steam trains were being replaced by [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] power, the mines began to shut down in the 1920s. Although the local coal mines were far from played out (approximately 80% of the coal in the Roslyn mines remains unextracted), the last mine in the area closed in 1963 as business became unprofitable. With the loss of jobs, an exodus of residents ensued. In the mid-1970s, Roslyn began to flourish again as artists and others rehabilitated the town's houses and commercial buildings and settled there. Some individuals own second homes in Roslyn, while working and living full-time in Seattle or Tacoma, for instance.\n\nAs Roslyn was a \"[[company town]]\", life in the early years was centered around the production of coal. Most of the citizens of the town worked either for the Northern Pacific Coal Company or in one of the smaller businesses monopolized by the company, or were family members of someone who did. A hub of life in the town was the [[Northwestern Improvement Company Store]], now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; it still stands at the corner of First Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.<ref name=nris-2>{{NRISref|2013a|dateform=mdy|accessdate=September 9, 2017|refnum=73001881|name=Northwestern Improvement Company Store}}</ref>\n\nLike many 19th-century American towns and cities, where risk of fires was high, Roslyn had a major fire in 1888, which destroyed most of its commercial district. Many buildings constructed after the fire used fire-resistant brick and sandstone. Some of these historic structures are still in use, including the 1889 Brick Tavern and the circa-1890 Fischer Building.\n\nDuring its days of prosperity, the Northern Pacific Coal Company built the Roslyn Athletic Club for miners and their families. It was completed in 1902 and contained a gym, meeting rooms, and a bowling alley. Roslyn's public library, which was founded in 1898, moved into the Roslyn Athletic Club building in 1918. It continues to serve the community from this location.\n\nMost of the town's 500 homes were built in the 1920s on land owned by the railroad. The 1920s-era commercial district consisted of four square blocks, of which about one dozen buildings remain as representatives of western frontier commercial architecture. Roslyn has many examples of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] elegance in its surviving buildings, as well as simple miner's shacks. The town of Roslyn was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.<ref name=nris-1>{{NRISref|2013a|dateform=mdy|accessdate=September 9, 2017|refnum=78002760|name=Roslyn Historic District}}</ref> Recently, Roslyn became a Certified Local Government. Its Historic Preservation Commission restored the Roslyn Cafe, a local landmark.\n\nRoslyn's railroad tracks have been removed and replaced by the Coal Mines Trail which runs from Cle Elum through Roslyn to Ronald. A walk on the trail affords visitors a look at the remains of Roslyn's mines and railroad depot site. The Roslyn Museum houses an extensive collection of photos and mining memorabilia, and features an exhibit on Roslyn's unique ethnic cemeteries.\n\nMost recently, recreation and tourism have become the chief drivers of the economy. The business community has worked to bring in more visitors through annual festivals, including the Manly Man Festival in June, the Pioneer Days Picnic, and a Coal Mining Festival associated with Coal Mining History Week each August.\n\n===Knights of Labor Strike of 1888 and African American migration===\n[[File:Roslyn-2.jpg|thumb|right|The Brick Tavern is the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state, and was featured prominently in ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' (1990 to 1995). Roslyn was used as the site for filming the fictitious town of Cicely, Alaska, in the hit CBS television series.]]\nTensions between management and labor in the Roslyn mines began spilling over in the summer of 1888, when management laid off a number of [[labor union]] workers who were petitioning for eight-hour work days and higher wages. These layoffs led to a [[labor strike]] by the [[Knights of Labor]], which shut down the mines. [[Northwest Coal Company]], which conducted mining operations at Mine No. 3, a few miles away in nearby [[Ronald, Washington|Ronald]], responded by recruiting [[strikebreaker]]s. This included 50 black laborers from the East and Midwest who were transported by train with almost 40 private armed guards. The recruitment of these armed forces raised the interest of Territorial Governor [[Eugene Semple]] when he heard that they harassed area residents calling themselves [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]]. This was considered a [[paramilitary]] challenge to Washington Territory authority and Semple ordered the local sheriff to disperse the unit.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9240|title=Roslyn coalminers strike, precipitating the importation of black miners, on August 17, 1888.|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\nSemple visited Roslyn to investigate Northwest Coal Company's practices and condemned the company for hiring a private militia on suppositions that the white strikers would attack black laborers and overpower police forces. Semple's report describes the residents as \"intelligent\" and \"law-abiding,\" and the company's suppositions as erroneous. He did not intervene on the labor disputes, and strikers continued to lose ground in negotiations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a span of two years, the company recruited more than 300 black laborers from [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Kentucky]]. Many relocated with families, and this migration was the largest increase in the African-American population of Washington Territory up until that time. Sheriff Packwood of Kittitas County reported to Semple that relations between out-of-work white workers and the black population were strained with potential to turn violent. However, after the strike broke tensions reduced, and whites reconciled with working along black miners. As the regional coal industry boomed, competition for employment reduced, and eventually workers organized as equals with [[United Mine Workers]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/aaw/vignette_aahw/roslyn-washington/|title=Roslyn, Washington (1886-- ) \u2022 BlackPast|date=2008-03-15|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roslyn-miner-memorial-and-KBHR.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Coal Miners' Memorial in Roslyn.

Snipes and Co. bank robbery===\nOn September 24, 1892, a group of five bandits, known criminals and affiliates of [[Butch Cassidy]], held up the Roslyn branch of the Ellensburg-based Ben Snipes Bank. Two of the men stood guard with the horses while the other three went inside. One of the men approached the cashier asking for what ever was in the already open vault. The other two men kept the customers in the store quiet, one of them was Dr. Lyon who would later be murdered and the case never solved. The five men rode away with $5,000 or $10,000, depending on the source. It is thought that the men were expecting the coal miner's pay, $40,000 coming from Tacoma, would have been held in the bank. However, the money was sent directly to the coal company.\n\nThe sheriff and his posse soon chased after the men and into the hills of Tenanaway. In November 1892, three men were brought into the jail and were asked to be identified by the witnesses of the robbery. Cal, Kimize, and Zachary Hale were taken in and arrested. Cal was the only one of the three men to be charged and found guilty of the crime.\n\nA couple of months later, the Kittitas County Courts, received a very interesting letter from Utah, telling them that they had convicted the wrong man. Cal Hale was set free and the search for Tom, George, William and Fred McCarthy, as well as Ras Lewis (alias Ras Christiansen and Matt Warner). In April 1893, a posse traveled down into Oregon looking for these bandits. George and William went with the men without a fight. Tom, Fred and Ras took off and were soon lost. Later that month the Yakima County Attorney received a letter from Rosa Lewis, Ras Lewis' wife, stating that she knew that the men had done it and she was tired of her husbands battle with the law. Soon after the Sheriff and his posse went to the cabin at the \"7 U Ranch\", owned by Fred Beezley, that Ras and his wife were leasing.\n\nAll five men were eventually taken into custody and tried. George and Ras attempted to break free and ran around the city of Ellensburg until the sheriff was able to detain them. There were two separate trials that would take place. This first was dismissed due to being a mistrial and the second one ending without any answers. It is rumored that the lawyer simply asked the men to tell them where the money had been stored. Court records state that they simply did not have witnesses that were able to testify.\n\nThe trials and all other fees associated with bringing justice to the county nearly bankrupted Kittitas County. Ras Lewis changed his name to Matt Warner, he was involved in a shoot out in 1895 and was arrested, serving 4 years. After that he became a Justice of the Peace and Sheriff of Price, Utah until his death in 1938.\n\nSeveral of the McCartys were later killed during an attempted bank robbery in [[Colorado]].<ref name=\"Lyman\">{{cite book |title= History of the Yakima Valley, Washington, Comprising Yakima, Kittitas and Benton Counties |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofyakimav01lyma |last= Lyman |first= W.D. |year= 1919 |publisher= The S.J.

It was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978. Clustered on {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of woods and hills above the town's main street, the land was donated by or purchased from the Northern Pacific Company by fraternal, ethnic and civic organizations for burial of their deceased members.\n\nThe Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), Knights of Pythias Lodge, Soloka Lodge, Wanapum Tribe 28, Improved Order of Redmen, ''Cacciatori d\u2019Africa'' (literally Hunters of Africa \u2013 an Italian lodge), Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge No. 56, SNF Lodge No. 79 (Serbian), St. Barbara Lodge No. 39 (Greek Catholic), and Dr. David Starcevich Lodge No. 56 (Croatian) are among the organizations and ethnicities represented at the cemetery. At least 24 nationalities are represented among the nearly 5,000 graves.\n\n===Post mining era===\n[[File:Cle Elum Lake (533523210).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lake Cle Elum near Roslyn is a year-round recreational destination.]] Although Roslyn clings to its coal mining and timber harvesting past, it has become a tourist and recreation destination. Tourism to the town received a boost when it was feature as the filming location for ''[[The Runner Stumbles]]'' and ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. The town's proximity to Seattle makes it a popular destination for recreational travelers.\n\nAs many as 2,000 luxury homes are being developed nearby, potentially adding to the old town's population.  Forests once owned and managed by [[Plum Creek Timber Company]] have been sold to two development companies, which are in the process of developing an extensive [[golf course community]] with houses and condominiums on the boundary of Roslyn. The new community is called [[Suncadia]]. As in similar small towns being transformed by large-scale capital projects and outside investment, these changes are expected to significantly improve Roslyn.<ref>''The Economist,'' Volume 379, Number 8481, pp. 30-31, 10 June 2006</ref>\n\nRoslyn's railroad tracks have been removed and replaced by the Coal Mines Trail which runs from Cle Elum through Roslyn to Ronald.

Numerous local residents appeared in the movie as extras. Directed and produced by [[Stanley Kramer]], the film was released by [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. Viewers of the film who have gone to Roslyn as tourists often stop at the Immaculate Conception Church, which was featured.\n*''[[Northern Exposure]]'' (1990\u201395), a hit [[CBS]] television series, filmed its exterior scenes for the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, in Roslyn and the surrounding area. Featured in the opening title sequence are the Roslyn Cafe and a [[moose]], the latter provided by [[Washington State University]]. Many local residents served as extras in the show, and some gained small parts. The ''Northern Exposure'' link is a tourist draw; many local stores use the show as a theme for their goods.\n*In 2009, the band [[Bon Iver]], with singer [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]], wrote and recorded the song \"Roslyn\", named after the Washington town.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The song was featured on the soundtrack to [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'s second installment, the film ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon|New Moon]].''\n*In 2014, the [[Amazon Studios]]'s TV adaptation of [[Philip K.

The City of Roslyn and the Friends of the Roslyn Library have collaborated to support its structural repair and renovation.\n* '''Roslyn Museum''' \u2013 Located on Pennsylvania Avenue, the museum includes an excellent display of artifacts from Roslyn's glory days as a coal mining town.\n* '''Historic Coal Mines''' \u2013 Visitors can go to the Roslyn municipal offices, located on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and First Street, for information on tours of the historic coal mines. No tours go inside the mines.\n* '''Roslyn Sunday Market''' \u2013 Every Sunday from June through September, this outdoor farmer's market and craft fair is located on Pennsylvania Avenue, offering a selection of local fruits, vegetables, arts, crafts and locally produced specialty items.\n* '''Immaculate Conception Church''' \u2013 Located on Idaho and \"B\" Streets overlooking Roslyn, this Roman Catholic church has a spire that is a notable landmark in the town. It was built in 1887 and continues to serve the local community with regular masses held every Sunday. The church was used for scenes in the 1979 film ''[[The Runner Stumbles]].'' \n* '''Storefront Studio''' \u2013 This yearly project is a collaboration between the Roslyn Downtown Association and the [[University of Washington]]'s architectural department. Each year (usually April through May), numerous students come to work with commercial, civic and community clients on real, small-scale architectural, planning, public art, and landscape projects in the town. More information is available at the Roslyn Visitor Center.\n* '''Coal Mines Trail''' \u2013 Originating in nearby Cle Elum, this hiking and recreational trail passes through Roslyn before ending in the town of Ronald.  The trail follows the original Northern Pacific Railway line.  Access is at the east end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n* '''Coal Miners' Memorial''' \u2013 Located across from the current city hall, this memorial statue commemorates those individuals who lost their lives in local coal mining. \n* '''Cicely's Gift Shop'''- founded in 1989 by Marianne Milos Ojurovich, the store originally opened in a 9' x 11' former coal mine weight station building set in the back of an empty lot on 2nd street. In 1995 after the ending of the globally famous television show Northern Exposure, she relocated the store to its current location, the former set of Dr. Fleischmans office, which she kept as intact as possible.\n* '''The Brick Tavern''' \u2013 In 1889, John Buffo and Peter Giovanni opened a tavern in this location. The tavern was rebuilt in 1898 using 45,000 bricks and took the name \"The Brick\". It is billed as the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state of Washington.<ref>The Brick Tavern claims the title of the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state of Washington, opening in 1889 and operating under a single name since 1898. According to its owners, the Bluebird Inn in [[Bickleton, Washington]], is the state's oldest functioning tavern having first opened in 1882; however, it has operated under numerous names and has not been continuously licensed to operate since its founding.</ref> The building was used for scenes of a fictional tavern of the same name in the 1990s television series ''Northern Exposure''.\n* '''Roslyn Cemetery''' \u2013 Divided into areas by lodge (Knights of Labor, Elks, IOOF, Red Men etc.) and by country of origin (Croatian, Italian, Polish, Slovak, etc.), the cemetery provides a historical perspective on Roslyn.\n* '''[[Ronald, Washington]]''' \u2013 Approximately 2&nbsp;miles west of Roslyn, this town was built over Mine No. 3, where Southern black miners were brought in 1892 to work as strikebreakers. \n* '''[[Lake Cle Elum]]-''' Lake Cle Elum is a popular year-round recreational destination for camping, fishing, boating, and swimming. \n*'''Salmon La Sac''' \u2013  Salmon La Sac is a nature area along the [[Cle Elum River]] used for [[kayak]] races, and it serves as an access point to the nearby wilderness and backcountry activities including hiking, 4x4ing, snow shoeing, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. It leads into and is in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.\n\n==Roslyn Historic District==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Roslyn Historic District\n  | nrhp_type = hd\n  | image = Morning,_Roslyn,_WA.jpg\n  | caption = Old storefronts in historic district\n  | location= WA 2E, Roslyn, Washington\n  | locmapin = \n  | built = {{Start date|1890}}\n  | added = February 14, 1978\n  | area = {{convert|340|acre}}\n  | refnum = 78002760<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2013a}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''Roslyn Historic District''' consists of the town of Roslyn as of 1977 which corresponds to the 1914 plat map, as well as the cluster of 26 cemeteries southwest of the town and a {{convert|58|acre}} open space, bisected by the tracks of the Roslyn Branch of the Northern Pacific Railroad, east of the town.<ref name=\"nrhpdoc\">{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=78002760}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Roslyn Historic District |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Florence K.

The town was the filming location for ''[[The Runner Stumbles]]'', ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', and ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]''.

[[BlackPast.org]]. Retrieved 2018-01-19.</ref>\n\nThroughout the mid-1880s, the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], the parent of Northern Pacific Coal Company, pushed from the east to reach [[Puget Sound]] across the [[Cascade Mountains]]. The Northern Pacific began building across [[Stampede Pass]] just west of Roslyn, approaching from [[Wallula, Washington|Wallula]] in the east and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] in the west. A 77-mile (124-km) gap remained in 1886. In January of that year, Nelson Bennett was given a contract to construct a 9,850&nbsp;foot (3,002&nbsp;m) tunnel under Stampede Pass, completing it in 1888. Roslyn, which lies on the route to Stampede Pass, provided the coal for the railway construction work as well as the continuing railroad operations.\n\nBetween 1886 and 1929, immigrant workers from countries such as [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] as well as from [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] came to work in the mines. These immigrants maintained the traditions of their homelands, as seen in the historic Roslyn Cemetery, with its 26 sections for distinct ethnic and lodge cemetery areas. Many Roslyn residents today are descendants of these immigrant miners.\n\nRoslyn's peak coal mine production of nearly 2 million tons was reached in 1910. As coal-fired steam trains were being replaced by [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] power, the mines began to shut down in the 1920s. Although the local coal mines were far from played out (approximately 80% of the coal in the Roslyn mines remains unextracted), the last mine in the area closed in 1963 as business became unprofitable. With the loss of jobs, an exodus of residents ensued. In the mid-1970s, Roslyn began to flourish again as artists and others rehabilitated the town's houses and commercial buildings and settled there. Some individuals own second homes in Roslyn, while working and living full-time in Seattle or Tacoma, for instance.\n\nAs Roslyn was a \"[[company town]]\", life in the early years was centered around the production of coal. Most of the citizens of the town worked either for the Northern Pacific Coal Company or in one of the smaller businesses monopolized by the company, or were family members of someone who did. A hub of life in the town was the [[Northwestern Improvement Company Store]], now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; it still stands at the corner of First Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.<ref name=nris-2>{{NRISref|2013a|dateform=mdy|accessdate=September 9, 2017|refnum=73001881|name=Northwestern Improvement Company Store}}</ref>\n\nLike many 19th-century American towns and cities, where risk of fires was high, Roslyn had a major fire in 1888, which destroyed most of its commercial district. Many buildings constructed after the fire used fire-resistant brick and sandstone. Some of these historic structures are still in use, including the 1889 Brick Tavern and the circa-1890 Fischer Building.\n\nDuring its days of prosperity, the Northern Pacific Coal Company built the Roslyn Athletic Club for miners and their families. It was completed in 1902 and contained a gym, meeting rooms, and a bowling alley. Roslyn's public library, which was founded in 1898, moved into the Roslyn Athletic Club building in 1918. It continues to serve the community from this location.\n\nMost of the town's 500 homes were built in the 1920s on land owned by the railroad. The 1920s-era commercial district consisted of four square blocks, of which about one dozen buildings remain as representatives of western frontier commercial architecture. Roslyn has many examples of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] elegance in its surviving buildings, as well as simple miner's shacks. The town of Roslyn was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.<ref name=nris-1>{{NRISref|2013a|dateform=mdy|accessdate=September 9, 2017|refnum=78002760|name=Roslyn Historic District}}</ref> Recently, Roslyn became a Certified Local Government. Its Historic Preservation Commission restored the Roslyn Cafe, a local landmark.\n\nRoslyn's railroad tracks have been removed and replaced by the Coal Mines Trail which runs from Cle Elum through Roslyn to Ronald. A walk on the trail affords visitors a look at the remains of Roslyn's mines and railroad depot site. The Roslyn Museum houses an extensive collection of photos and mining memorabilia, and features an exhibit on Roslyn's unique ethnic cemeteries.\n\nMost recently, recreation and tourism have become the chief drivers of the economy. The business community has worked to bring in more visitors through annual festivals, including the Manly Man Festival in June, the Pioneer Days Picnic, and a Coal Mining Festival associated with Coal Mining History Week each August.\n\n===Knights of Labor Strike of 1888 and African American migration===\n[[File:Roslyn-2.jpg|thumb|right|The Brick Tavern is the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state, and was featured prominently in ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' (1990 to 1995). Roslyn was used as the site for filming the fictitious town of Cicely, Alaska, in the hit CBS television series.]]\nTensions between management and labor in the Roslyn mines began spilling over in the summer of 1888, when management laid off a number of [[labor union]] workers who were petitioning for eight-hour work days and higher wages. These layoffs led to a [[labor strike]] by the [[Knights of Labor]], which shut down the mines. [[Northwest Coal Company]], which conducted mining operations at Mine No. 3, a few miles away in nearby [[Ronald, Washington|Ronald]], responded by recruiting [[strikebreaker]]s. This included 50 black laborers from the East and Midwest who were transported by train with almost 40 private armed guards. The recruitment of these armed forces raised the interest of Territorial Governor [[Eugene Semple]] when he heard that they harassed area residents calling themselves [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]]. This was considered a [[paramilitary]] challenge to Washington Territory authority and Semple ordered the local sheriff to disperse the unit.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9240|title=Roslyn coalminers strike, precipitating the importation of black miners, on August 17, 1888.|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\nSemple visited Roslyn to investigate Northwest Coal Company's practices and condemned the company for hiring a private militia on suppositions that the white strikers would attack black laborers and overpower police forces. Semple's report describes the residents as \"intelligent\" and \"law-abiding,\" and the company's suppositions as erroneous. He did not intervene on the labor disputes, and strikers continued to lose ground in negotiations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a span of two years, the company recruited more than 300 black laborers from [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Kentucky]]. Many relocated with families, and this migration was the largest increase in the African-American population of Washington Territory up until that time. Sheriff Packwood of Kittitas County reported to Semple that relations between out-of-work white workers and the black population were strained with potential to turn violent. However, after the strike broke tensions reduced, and whites reconciled with working along black miners. As the regional coal industry boomed, competition for employment reduced, and eventually workers organized as equals with [[United Mine Workers]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/aaw/vignette_aahw/roslyn-washington/|title=Roslyn, Washington (1886-- ) \u2022 BlackPast|date=2008-03-15|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roslyn-miner-memorial-and-KBHR.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Coal Miners' Memorial in Roslyn. Note the radio station film set from the ''Northern Exposure'' television series in the background.]]\n\n===Mine accident of 1892===\nIn 1892, 45 miners were killed in an explosion at Mine No. 1 near Roslyn, the deadliest mining accident in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] history.\n\n===1892 Ben E. Snipes and Co. bank robbery===\nOn September 24, 1892, a group of five bandits, known criminals and affiliates of [[Butch Cassidy]], held up the Roslyn branch of the Ellensburg-based Ben Snipes Bank. Two of the men stood guard with the horses while the other three went inside. One of the men approached the cashier asking for what ever was in the already open vault. The other two men kept the customers in the store quiet, one of them was Dr. Lyon who would later be murdered and the case never solved. The five men rode away with $5,000 or $10,000, depending on the source. It is thought that the men were expecting the coal miner's pay, $40,000 coming from Tacoma, would have been held in the bank. However, the money was sent directly to the coal company.\n\nThe sheriff and his posse soon chased after the men and into the hills of Tenanaway. In November 1892, three men were brought into the jail and were asked to be identified by the witnesses of the robbery. Cal, Kimize, and Zachary Hale were taken in and arrested. Cal was the only one of the three men to be charged and found guilty of the crime.\n\nA couple of months later, the Kittitas County Courts, received a very interesting letter from Utah, telling them that they had convicted the wrong man. Cal Hale was set free and the search for Tom, George, William and Fred McCarthy, as well as Ras Lewis (alias Ras Christiansen and Matt Warner). In April 1893, a posse traveled down into Oregon looking for these bandits. George and William went with the men without a fight. Tom, Fred and Ras took off and were soon lost. Later that month the Yakima County Attorney received a letter from Rosa Lewis, Ras Lewis' wife, stating that she knew that the men had done it and she was tired of her husbands battle with the law. Soon after the Sheriff and his posse went to the cabin at the \"7 U Ranch\", owned by Fred Beezley, that Ras and his wife were leasing.\n\nAll five men were eventually taken into custody and tried. George and Ras attempted to break free and ran around the city of Ellensburg until the sheriff was able to detain them. There were two separate trials that would take place. This first was dismissed due to being a mistrial and the second one ending without any answers. It is rumored that the lawyer simply asked the men to tell them were the money had been stored. Court records state that they simply did not have witnesses that were able to testify.\n\nThe trials and all other fees associated with bringing justice to the county nearly bankrupted Kittitas County. Ras Lewis changed his name to Matt Warner, he was involved in a shoot out in 1895 and was arrested, serving 4 years. After that he became a Justice of the Peace and Sheriff of Price, Utah until his death in 1938.\n\nSeveral of the McCartys were later killed during an attempted bank robbery in [[Colorado]].<ref name=\"Lyman\">{{cite book |title= History of the Yakima Valley, Washington, Comprising Yakima, Kittitas and Benton Counties |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofyakimav01lyma |last= Lyman |first= W.D. |year= 1919 |publisher= The S.J.

The Black population began to decline after the mines closed in 1963, and by the early 1970s only the Craven family remained. William Craven was elected mayor of Roslyn in 1976, and was the first African American mayor in the state of Washington.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Roslyn Black Pioneers]] was established by [[Ethel Florence Craven]] to preserve and promote black history in Washington. The organization received a grant from [[Humanities Washington]] to build educational floats for Washington parades.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.humanities.org/blog/roslyn-black-pioneers-used-parade-floats-to-educate-and-entertain/|title=Roslyn Black Pioneers Used Parade Floats to Educate and Entertain|date=2013-11-14|website=Humanities Washington|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Roslyn's ethnic cemeteries===\n[[File:Roslyn-Slovak-Cemetery-P5270062.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roslyn's historic cemetery is divided into 26 ethnic plots like the one depicted here.]]\nThe Roslyn Cemetery is composed of 26 separate but adjacent cemetery plots, reflecting the diversity of early immigrant society. It was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978. Clustered on {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of woods and hills above the town's main street, the land was donated by or purchased from the Northern Pacific Company by fraternal, ethnic and civic organizations for burial of their deceased members.\n\nThe Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), Knights of Pythias Lodge, Soloka Lodge, Wanapum Tribe 28, Improved Order of Redmen, ''Cacciatori d\u2019Africa'' (literally Hunters of Africa \u2013 an Italian lodge), Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge No. 56, SNF Lodge No. 79 (Serbian), St. Barbara Lodge No. 39 (Greek Catholic), and Dr. David Starcevich Lodge No. 56 (Croatian) are among the organizations and ethnicities represented at the cemetery. At least 24 nationalities are represented among the nearly 5,000 graves.\n\n===Post mining era===\n[[File:Cle Elum Lake (533523210).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lake Cle Elum near Roslyn is a year-round recreational destination.]] Although Roslyn clings to its coal mining and timber harvesting past, it has become a tourist and recreation destination. Tourism to the town received a boost when it was feature as the filming location for ''[[The Runner Stumbles]]'' and ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. The town's proximity to Seattle makes it a popular destination for recreational travelers.\n\nAs many as 2,000 luxury homes are being developed nearby, potentially adding to the old town's population.  Forests once owned and managed by [[Plum Creek Timber Company]] have been sold to two development companies, which are in the process of developing an extensive [[golf course community]] with houses and condominiums on the boundary of Roslyn. The new community is called [[Suncadia]]. As in similar small towns being transformed by large-scale capital projects and outside investment, these changes are expected to significantly improve Roslyn.<ref>''The Economist,'' Volume 379, Number 8481, pp. 30-31, 10 June 2006</ref>\n\nRoslyn's railroad tracks have been removed and replaced by the Coal Mines Trail which runs from Cle Elum through Roslyn to Ronald. A walk on the trail affords visitors a look at the remains of Roslyn's mines and railroad depot site. The Roslyn Museum houses an extensive collection of photos and mining memorabilia, and features an exhibit on Roslyn's unique ethnic cemeteries.\n\nMost recently, recreation and tourism have become the chief drivers of the economy. The business community has worked to bring in more visitors through annual festivals, including the Manly Man Festival in June, the Pioneer Days Picnic, and a Coal Mining Festival associated with Coal Mining History Week each August.\n\n==Featured in media==\n*''[[The Runner Stumbles]]'', a 1979 film starring [[Dick Van Dyke]] and [[Kathleen Quinlan]], was filmed in Roslyn. Numerous local residents appeared in the movie as extras. Directed and produced by [[Stanley Kramer]], the film was released by [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. Viewers of the film who have gone to Roslyn as tourists often stop at the Immaculate Conception Church, which was featured.\n*''[[Northern Exposure]]'' (1990\u201395), a hit [[CBS]] television series, filmed its exterior scenes for the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, in Roslyn and the surrounding area. Featured in the opening title sequence are the Roslyn Cafe and a [[moose]], the latter provided by [[Washington State University]]. Many local residents served as extras in the show, and some gained small parts. The ''Northern Exposure'' link is a tourist draw; many local stores use the show as a theme for their goods.\n*In 2009, the band [[Bon Iver]], with singer [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]], wrote and recorded the song \"Roslyn\", named after the Washington town.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The song was featured on the soundtrack to [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'s second installment, the film ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon|New Moon]].''\n*In 2014, the [[Amazon Studios]]'s TV adaptation of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' was filmed in Roslyn, which was represented as Canon City, Colorado in the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/photosandvideos/localphotos/2542464-8/roslyn-hopes-new-tv-show-brings-15-more|newspaper=[[Yakima Herald]]|accessdate=1 Nov 2014|date=5 Oct 2014|title=Roslyn hopes new TV show brings 15 more minutes of fame|last=Muir|first=Pat|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141102014033/http://www.yakimaherald.com/photosandvideos/localphotos/2542464-8/roslyn-hopes-new-tv-show-brings-15-more|archivedate=2014-11-02}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRoslyn is located at {{coord|47|13|30|N|121|0|11|W|type:city}} (47.225091, -121.002985).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is {{convert|83.0|mi|km|abbr=on}} \u2013 about 1 hour 25 mins &ndash; east-south-east from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 1484\n|1900= 2786\n|1910= 3126\n|1920= 2673\n|1930= 2063\n|1940= 1743\n|1950= 1537\n|1960= 1283\n|1970= 1031\n|1980= 938\n|1990= 869\n|2000= 1017\n|2010= 893\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=959\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web |date=June 27, 2019 |title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref> of 2010, there were 893 people, 437 households, and 224 families residing in the city.

The City of Roslyn and the Friends of the Roslyn Library have collaborated to support its structural repair and renovation.\n* '''Roslyn Museum''' \u2013 Located on Pennsylvania Avenue, the museum includes an excellent display of artifacts from Roslyn's glory days as a coal mining town.\n* '''Historic Coal Mines''' \u2013 Visitors can go to the Roslyn municipal offices, located on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and First Street, for information on tours of the historic coal mines. No tours go inside the mines.\n* '''Roslyn Sunday Market''' \u2013 Every Sunday from June through September, this outdoor farmer's market and craft fair is located on Pennsylvania Avenue, offering a selection of local fruits, vegetables, arts, crafts and locally produced specialty items.\n* '''Immaculate Conception Church''' \u2013 Located on Idaho and \"B\" Streets overlooking Roslyn, this Roman Catholic church has a spire that is a notable landmark in the town. It was built in 1887 and continues to serve the local community with regular masses held every Sunday. The church was used for scenes in the 1979 film ''[[The Runner Stumbles]].'' \n* '''Storefront Studio''' \u2013 This yearly project is a collaboration between the Roslyn Downtown Association and the [[University of Washington]]'s architectural department. Each year (usually April through May), numerous students come to work with commercial, civic and community clients on real, small-scale architectural, planning, public art, and landscape projects in the town. More information is available at the Roslyn Visitor Center.\n* '''Coal Mines Trail''' \u2013 Originating in nearby Cle Elum, this hiking and recreational trail passes through Roslyn before ending in the town of Ronald.  The trail follows the original Northern Pacific Railway line.  Access is at the east end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n* '''Coal Miners' Memorial''' \u2013 Located across from the current city hall, this memorial statue commemorates those individuals who lost their lives in local coal mining. \n* '''Cicely's Gift Shop'''- founded in 1989 by Marianne Milos Ojurovich, the store originally opened in a 9' x 11' former coal mine weight station building set in the back of an empty lot on 2nd street. In 1995 after the ending of the globally famous television show Northern Exposure, she relocated the store to its current location, the former set of Dr. Fleischmans office, which she kept as intact as possible.\n* '''The Brick Tavern''' \u2013 In 1889, John Buffo and Peter Giovanni opened a tavern in this location. The tavern was rebuilt in 1898 using 45,000 bricks and took the name \"The Brick\". It is billed as the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state of Washington.<ref>The Brick Tavern claims the title of the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state of Washington, opening in 1889 and operating under a single name since 1898. According to its owners, the Bluebird Inn in [[Bickleton, Washington]], is the state's oldest functioning tavern having first opened in 1882; however, it has operated under numerous names and has not been continuously licensed to operate since its founding.</ref> The building was used for scenes of a fictional tavern of the same name in the 1990s television series ''Northern Exposure''.\n* '''Roslyn Cemetery''' \u2013 Divided into areas by lodge (Knights of Labor, Elks, IOOF, Red Men etc.) and by country of origin (Croatian, Italian, Polish, Slovak, etc.), the cemetery provides a historical perspective on Roslyn.\n* '''[[Ronald, Washington]]''' \u2013 Approximately 2&nbsp;miles west of Roslyn, this town was built over Mine No. 3, where Southern black miners were brought in 1892 to work as strikebreakers. \n* '''[[Lake Cle Elum]]-''' Lake Cle Elum is a popular year-round recreational destination for camping, fishing, boating, and swimming. \n*'''Salmon La Sac''' \u2013  Salmon La Sac is a nature area along the [[Cle Elum River]] used for [[kayak]] races, and it serves as an access point to the nearby wilderness and backcountry activities including hiking, 4x4ing, snow shoeing, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling.

Yet Rosenzweig's major criticism is that:\n\n<blockquote>Good historical writing requires not just factual accuracy but also a command of the scholarly literature, persuasive analysis and interpretations, and clear and engaging prose. By those measures, ''American National Biography Online'' easily outdistances Wikipedia.<ref name=Rosenzweig/></blockquote>\n\nRosenzweig also criticized the \"waffling{{snd}} encouraged by the [neutral point of view] policy{{snd}} [which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history [articles]\", and quoted the historical conclusion of the biography of [[William Clarke Quantrill]], a Confederate guerrilla in the United States Civil War, as an example of [[Weasel words|weasel-word]] waffling:\n\n<blockquote>Some historians{{nbsp}}... remember [Quantrill] as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while other [historians] continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.<ref name=Rosenzweig/></blockquote>\n\nRosenzweig  contrasted Wikipedia's [[Abraham Lincoln]] article with that of [[James M.

McPherson\u2014a Princeton professor and winner of the Pulitzer Prize\u2014showed \"richer contextualization\", as well as \"his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln\u2019s voice\" and \"his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\"  By contrast Wikipedia's prose was \"both verbose and dull\" and thus difficult to read, because \"the skill and confident judgment of a seasoned historian\" are absent from the antiquarian writing style of Wikipedia, as opposed to the writing style used by professional historians in the ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' magazine.

Although many articles in newspapers have concentrated on minor factual errors in Wikipedia articles, there are also concerns about large-scale, presumably unintentional effects from the increasing influence and use of Wikipedia as a research tool at all levels. In an article in the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' magazine (London) [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|philosopher Martin Cohen]] describes Wikipedia as having \"become a monopoly\" with \"all the prejudices and ignorance of its creators,\" which he calls a \"youthful cab-driver's\" perspective.<ref name=\"Cohen 26\">{{Cite web|title=Encyclopaedia Idiotica|first=Martin|last=Cohen|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|issue=2008\u201308\u201328|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403327|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref> Cohen concludes that \"[t]o control the reference sources that people use is to control the way people comprehend the world.

Yet Rosenzweig's major criticism is that:\n\n<blockquote>Good historical writing requires not just factual accuracy but also a command of the scholarly literature, persuasive analysis and interpretations, and clear and engaging prose. By those measures, ''American National Biography Online'' easily outdistances Wikipedia.<ref name=Rosenzweig/></blockquote>\n\nRosenzweig also criticized the \"waffling{{snd}} encouraged by the [neutral point of view] policy{{snd}} [which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history [articles]\", and quoted the historical conclusion of the biography of [[William Clarke Quantrill]], a Confederate guerrilla in the United States Civil War, as an example of [[Weasel words|weasel-word]] waffling:\n\n<blockquote>Some historians{{nbsp}}... remember [Quantrill] as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while other [historians] continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.<ref name=Rosenzweig/></blockquote>\n\nRosenzweig  contrasted Wikipedia's [[Abraham Lincoln]] article with that of [[James M.

McPherson\u2014a Princeton professor and winner of the Pulitzer Prize\u2014showed \"richer contextualization\", as well as \"his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln\u2019s voice\" and \"his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\"  By contrast Wikipedia's prose was \"both verbose and dull\" and thus difficult to read, because \"the skill and confident judgment of a seasoned historian\" are absent from the antiquarian writing style of Wikipedia, as opposed to the writing style used by professional historians in the ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' magazine.

Communications was facilitated by a \"WikiProject,\" called \"WikiProject Firearms\", an on-wiki group of editors with a common interest.

Shankbone wrote, \"If you become a target on Wikipedia, do not expect a supportive community.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/06/express/nobodys-safe-in-cyber-space|title=Nobody's Safe in Cyberspace|last=Shankbone|first=David|date=June 7, 2008|work=[[The Brooklyn Rail]]|accessdate=July 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[David Auerbach]], writing in ''Slate'' magazine, said:<blockquote>I am not exaggerating when I say it is the closest thing to [[Franz Kafka|Kafka\u2019s]] ''[[The Trial]]'' I have ever witnessed, with editors and administrators giving conflicting and confusing advice, complaints getting \"boomeranged\" onto complainants who then face disciplinary action for complaining, and very little consistency in the standards applied. In my short time there, I repeatedly observed editors lawyering an issue with acronyms, only to turn around and declare \"[[Ignore all rules]]!\" when faced with the same rules used against them{{nbsp}}... The problem instead stems from the fact that administrators and longtime editors have developed a fortress mentality in which they see new editors as dangerous intruders who will wreck their beautiful encyclopedia, and thus antagonize and even persecute them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/12/wikipedia_editing_disputes_the_crowdsourced_encyclopedia_has_become_a_rancorous.html|title=Encyclopedia Frown|first1=David|last1=Auerbach|work=Slate|date=11 December 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWikipedia has also been criticised for its weak enforcement against perceived toxicities among the editing community at various times. For instance, an editor whose name is \"Calton\" was revealed to be still allowed to edit despite numerous temporary blocks for being uncivil, rather than being banned for the repeated conduct. In another case a longtime editor was nearly driven to suicide following an online abuse from editors and a ban from the site before being rescued from the suicide attempt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wikipedia Has a Civility Issue That Creates a Toxic Editing Environment |url=https://www.legalmorning.com/wikipedia-has-civility-issue-creates-toxic-editing-environment/ |website=Legalmorning |accessdate=28 February 2020 |date=15 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Koebler |first1=Jason |title=Wikipedia Editor Says Site\u2019s Toxic Community Has Him Contemplating Suicide |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xangm/wikipedia-editor-says-sites-toxic-community-has-him-contemplating-suicide |website=Vice |accessdate=28 February 2020 |language=en |date=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Consensus and the \"hive mind\"===\n[[Oliver Kamm]], in an article for ''[[The Times]]'', said Wikipedia's reliance on consensus in forming its content was dubious:<ref name=okw/>\n<blockquote>\nWikipedia seeks not truth but consensus, and like an interminable political meeting the end result will be dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices.\n</blockquote>\n\nWikimedia advisor [[Benjamin Mako Hill]] also talked about Wikipedia's disproportional representation of viewpoints, saying:\n<blockquote>\nIn [[Wikipedia]], debates can be won by stamina. If you care more and argue longer, you will tend to get your way. The result, very often, is that individuals and organizations with a very strong interest in having Wikipedia say a particular thing tend to win out over other editors who just want the [[encyclopedia]] to be solid, neutral, and reliable. These less-committed editors simply have less at stake and their attention is more distributed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Benjamin Mako|authorlink=Benjamin Mako Hill|title=The Institute for Cultural Diplomacy and Wikipedia|url=http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/the-institute-for-cultural-diplomacy-and-wikipedia|website=mako.cc|publisher=eous|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWikimedia trustee Dariusz Jemielniak says:\n<blockquote>\nTiring out one's opponent is a common strategy among experienced Wikipedians{{nbsp}}...

And that is part of the larger pattern of the appeal of a new online [[collectivism]] that is nothing less than a resurgence of the idea that the collective is all-wise, that it is desirable to have influence concentrated in a bottleneck that can channel the collective with the most verity and force. This is different from [[representative democracy]], or [[meritocracy]]. This idea has had dreadful consequences when thrust upon us from the extreme Right or the extreme Left in various historical periods. The fact that it's now being re-introduced today by prominent technologists and futurists, people who in many cases I know and like, doesn't make it any less dangerous.<ref name=\"JaronLanier\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nLanier also says the current economic trend is to reward entities that aggregate information, rather than those that actually generate content. In the absence of \"new business models\", the popular demand for [[information|content]] will be sated by mediocrity, thus reducing or even eliminating any monetary incentives for the production of ''new'' knowledge.<ref name=\"JaronLanier\">{{Cite news|first=Jaron|last=Lanier|title=Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier06/lanier06_index.html|publisher=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge]]|date=May 30, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nLanier's opinions produced some strong disagreement. Internet consultant [[Clay Shirky]] noted that Wikipedia has many internal controls in place and is not a mere mass of unintelligent collective effort:\n\n<blockquote>Neither proponents nor detractors of hive mind rhetoric have much interesting to say about Wikipedia itself, because both groups ignore the details{{nbsp}}... Wikipedia is best viewed as an engaged community that uses a large and growing number of regulatory mechanisms to manage a huge set of proposed edits{{nbsp}}...

Macedonia is the largest and {{nowrap|second-most-populous}} Greek region, with a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly [[mountain]]ous, with most major urban centers such as [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Kavala]] being concentrated on its southern coastline. Together with [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], and sometimes also [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], it is part of [[Northern Greece]]. Greek Macedonia encompasses entirely the southern part of the [[region of Macedonia]],<ref>Roy E. H. Mellor, ''Eastern Europe: A Geography of the Comecon Countries'', Macmillan International Higher Education, 1975, {{ISBN|1349155594}}, p. 62.</ref> making up 51% of the total area of the region. It also contains [[Mount Athos]], an autonomous monastic region of Greece. Macedonia forms part of Greece's [[border|national frontier]] with three countries: [[Bulgaria]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the north, and [[Albania]] to the northwest.\n\nMacedonia incorporates most of the territories of ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], a kingdom ruled by the [[Argead Dynasty|Argeads]], whose most celebrated members were [[Alexander the Great]] and his father [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. The name ''Macedonia'' was later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative areas in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires, resulting in [[Macedonia (region)|modern geographical Macedonia]].

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions. The new system was based on administrative divisions called [[Themata]]. The region of Macedonia Prima (the territory of modern Greek administrative district of Macedonia) was divided between the Thema of Thessaloniki and the Thema of Strymon, so that only the region of the area from [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]] eastwards continued to carry the name Macedonia, referred to as the [[Macedonia (theme)|Thema of Macedonia]] or the Thema of \"Macedonia in Thrace\".

In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

Therefore ancient Macedonia did not significantly extend beyond its current borders (in Greece).

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions.

Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.
