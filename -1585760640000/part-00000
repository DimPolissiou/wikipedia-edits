He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre. He feared the Memon community would retaliate and possibly have him killed because of the stand he made, so he left the country in search of both safety and knowledge. Edhi travelled to [[Europe]] and made his way to [[London]] via [[Rome]] by asking for donations. His time in London allowed him to thoroughly examine the [[Welfare|social welfare]] programs active throughout the [[United Kingdom]], off of which he organized and laid the foundation for the rest of his charitable works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8440920/The-day-I-met-Abdul-Sattar-Edhi-a-living-saint.html|title=The day I met Abdul Sattar Edhi, a living saint|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2008-04-10|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"People have become educated, but have yet to become human.\"|author=|title=|source=Abdul Sattar Edhi<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/middleeast/abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-father-teresa-dies-at-88.html?nytmobile=0|title=Abdus Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's 'Father Teresa,' Dies at 88 - NYTimes.com|first=Salman|last=Masood|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=9 July 2016|date=8 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n===Date of Birth Controversy===\nIn his autobiography, Edhi revealed that he didn't know his actual date of birth,{{sfn|Tehmina Durrani|1996}} but according to media reports published following his death, he was born on 1 January 1928.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/135894-Name-the-new-airport-after-Edhi|title=Name the new airport after Edhi|work=thenews.com.pk|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi laid to rest in Karachi|url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Radio Pakistan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021135535/http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|archivedate=21 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nation mourns Abdul Sattar Edhi's demise \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/344363-Nation-mourns-Abdul-Sattar-Edhis-demise|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US condoles death of Abdul Sattar Edhi|url=http://nation.com.pk/international/12-Jul-2016/us-condoles-death-of-abdul-sattar-edhi|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Nation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Significant people born on 1st January|url=http://aaj.tv/2016/01/significant-people-born-on-1st-january/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Aaj News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dailytimes {{!}} Late Abdul Sattar Edhi's Qul held amid tight security|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/11-Jul-16/late-abdul-sattar-edhis-qul-held-amid-tight-security|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The gems world lost in 2016 \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/368092-The-gems-world-lost-in-2016|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref> In 2017, [[Google Doodle]] marked his date of birth as 28 February 1928 following which several reports emerged in favour of 28 February 1928 being his birthdate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi: Why Google honours him today|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/abdul-sattar-edhi-google-honours-angel-mercy-170227140720826.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Who was Abdul Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's humble 'Angel of Mercy' who founded a charity empire from a Karachi slum?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/27/who-was-abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-angel-of-mercy/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' noted \"There has been uncertainty about when his birthday is.

He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre.
