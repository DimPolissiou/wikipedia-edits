The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\", tracks that ranked on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\". Along with groups such as friendly rivals [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s [[Los Angeles]] [[glam metal]] scene, also known as \"hair metal\" or \"pop metal\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhHJtFnIC_QC&pg=PA12 |page=12 |title=Running with the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |first=Robert |last=Walser |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780819574213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxWasD0U6pcC&pg=PA104 |pages=103\u2013104 |title=Studies in Symbolic Interaction |editor=Norman K.

In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Bobby Blotzer's Crystal Pystal Experience. The name Bobby Blotzer's Crystal Pystal Experience turned into Bobby Blotzer's Mickey Ratt Experience in 1976.\n\nGuitarist [[Robbin Crosby]] in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Asakawa.\n\nBobby Blotzer's Mickey Ratt Experience went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists [[Jake E. Lee]], [[Chris Hager]], and Bob DeLellis, bassists [[Matt Thorr]], Tim Garcia, and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording on Pearcy's indie record label Top Fuel Records.\n\nIn 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called \"Dr. Rock\" / \"Drivin' on E\", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.\n\nIn 1981, the band's name was shortened to Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist [[Warren DeMartini]], recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early \"Tell the World\" written by Pearcy was their first recording that was featured on the compilation ''[[Metal Massacre|Metal Massacre I]]'') temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of [[Bobby Blotzer]] (ex-Vic Vergeat) and [[Juan Croucier]] (previously with [[Dokken]], and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. [[Marq Torien]] briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/tags/marq-torien|title=Marq Torien|newspaper=MelodicRock.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>\n\n===''Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience EP'' (1983)===\nIn July 1983, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience signed with recording label Time Coast Music. Later that same year, Time Coast released in the United States the band's six-track debut [[Extended Play|EP]], simply titled ''[[Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience (EP)|Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience]]''. Newly formed independent UK label [[Music for Nations]] released a seven-track version of the EP in Europe, which included the additional track \"You're in Trouble\".\n\nStephen Pearcy wrote four of the six songs that were written back in the Bobby Blotzer's Mickey Ratt Experience days circa 1977-81. Pearcy and Robbin Crosby co-wrote the first single, \"You Think You're Tough\", that found its way onto local radio stations KLOS and KMET.\n\n===''Out of the Cellar'' (1984)===\nThe self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] which signed them. Bobby BLotzer's Ratt Experience immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent [[Van Halen]] and [[Aerosmith]]-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, [[staccato]] guitar-picking style of [[Judas Priest]]. [[Tawny Kitaen]], who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \"Back for More\" and on their EP from the previous year.\n\nThe album scored much radio and [[MTV]] play with songs like \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"Back for More\", and \"[[Lack of Communication (song)|Lack of Communication]]\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. [[Milton Berle]]'s guest appearance, dressed in his [[Uncle Miltie]] drag character, in the video for \"Round and Round\" helped draw even more attention to the band.\n\n''Out of the Cellar'' became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as [[Billy Squier]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Twisted Sister]] and [[Lita Ford]]. ''Out of the Cellar'' is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 1980s heavy metal, while \"Round and Round\" scored at No.&nbsp;61 on [[VH1]]'s ''Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show''.\n\n===''Invasion of Your Privacy'' (1985\u20131986)===\nThe band's second full-length album ''[[Invasion of Your Privacy]]'' was released July 1985.\nIt peaked at No.&nbsp;7 (which is the same position that ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' peaked). The album met mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. Allmusic.com has called it \"another batch of solid pop-metal tunes\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r16197 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Invasion of Your Privacy - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> It contained the favorites \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\" (which made No.&nbsp;40 on the Hot 100) that assured the band a presence on radio and MTV. Footage from the band's performances at [[Hirsch Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] were featured in the video to \"You're In Love\".\n\nDeMartini and Crosby's impressive guitar solos and Pearcy's highly sexual lyrics helped to further define the Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience sound. Although it did not achieve the sales figures or the status of their debut, ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' nonetheless was certified double platinum (selling over two million copies) and remains highly regarded amongst fans.\n\nA couple months after the album release, the band released a home video titled ''[[Ratt: The Video]]''. The video featured the music videos from the Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience EP, ''Out of the Cellar'' and ''Invasion of Your Privacy''. The video is currently out of print and is very rare and difficult to find. The video was the first commercially available video to certify Gold sales status in the USA and eventually reached Platinum.\n\nThe model on ''Invasion'''s cover is ''Playboy'' [[Playmate]] [[Marianne Gravatte]], who also made an appearance in the \"Lay It Down\" music video. Using a beautiful female model on an album cover later became a trend copied by many glam metal bands of the 1980s, such as [[Great White]], and [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], who coincidentally featured Robbin Crosby's wife on the cover of their debut album. Pearcy himself soon posed for Playgirl (August '86 issue). ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' was also one of the many albums that received the attention of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] since the cover and the album title were a reference to [[voyeurism]].{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} The [[Tipper Gore]]-led organization presented it at a [[U.S. Congress]]ional hearing on September 19, 1985 dealing with [[parental advisory]] labels on albums that display \"inappropriate\" content.\nThe band toured extensively in the United States and Japan sharing stage with the likes of [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. In August 1985 the band played on the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Castle Donington, England, along with [[ZZ Top]], Bon Jovi, [[Metallica]] and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\n===''Dancing Undercover'' (1986\u20131987)===\nBobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience's next release was ''[[Dancing Undercover]]'' in September 1986. The album was a relative disappointment with most music critics at the time of its release. From a commercial standpoint however, the album kept Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience's string of consecutive Platinum albums alive. This is the first album as well to see Crosby's lead guitar duties minimized in favor of DeMartini.\n\nIn an effort to be taken more seriously, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience broke from the tradition of featuring a girl on the cover. They instead opted for gritty black-and-white photos of each of the five band members. Likewise, the album does not contain a single power ballad amongst its ten tracks and even features experimental forays into [[thrash metal|thrashier]] and [[heavy metal music|heavier]] sounds.\n\nThe song that reflected this most strikingly was \"[[Body Talk (Ratt song)|Body Talk]]\", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1986 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[The Golden Child]]''. The more straight-ahead style of the album (especially with this song) led many fans to believe that Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Expereince was headed in a direction more akin to the [[thrash metal|thrash]] style promulgated by such bands as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]]. However, that proved not to be the case as the slightly [[experimental music|experimental]] undertones of the album were quickly replaced with a [[blues music|bluesier]] sound throughout their next three releases.\n\nOther popular tracks generated by the album included \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\" and \"[[Slip of the Lip]]\".\nThrough 1987, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience embarked on a U.S. tour with newcomers [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and played in Europe as a part of the Monsters Of Rock Tour (widely bootlegged). Their tour with Poison was one of the highest grossing tours of 1987. Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience also played Madison Square Garden.\n\n===''Reach for the Sky'' (1988\u20131989)===\nThe group's follow-up, ''[[Reach for the Sky (Ratt album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' was released in November 1988. Although the album achieved Platinum sales status and reached No.&nbsp;17 on Billboard's album charts, it was widely panned by critics. Complaints ranged from it being formulaic and sophomoric to the album being uneven and lacking in focus. After this album, the band parted ways with long-time producer [[Beau Hill]]. For all the criticisms, ''Reach for the Sky'' nevertheless contained the popular tracks \"[[Way Cool Jr.]]\" and \"[[I Want a Woman]]\" which received their usual MTV airplay. Those two songs are now regarded as glam metal classics.\n\nThe surreal, Dali-esque album cover featured a statue wearing [[night vision goggles]], a human hand emerging from a bundle of [[twine]], a [[World War II]] fighter plane, and a [[wicker]] chair. The band has remained mum as to what the album cover is supposed to symbolize so as to facilitate the diverse interpretations of their fans. Early pressings of the album cover revealed the [[breast]] part of the statue as requested by lead singer Stephen Pearcy. According to Pearcy, he wanted to use that version of the cover but the other band members feared that this would keep the record out of certain music stores. The revised version of the album contained the same tracks, but in a different order. After the revised version hit the record stores, producer Beau Hill stepped down from producer duties and tensions within the band increased.\nThe band started the new year with a concert at the Tokyo Dome headlined by Bon Jovi The other bands in the bill were Kingdom Come and Britny Fox. Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience soon played the Tokyo Dome on their own. Both appearances have been widely bootlegged.\nThe tour that followed in the spring of '89 (supported by Kix, Warrant and Britny Fox) was eventually cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\n\n===''Detonator'' (1990\u20131991)===\nBobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience's fifth album ''[[Detonator (album)|Detonator]]'' was released in August 1990. Sir Arthur Payson took over as producer for the band following [[Beau Hill]]'s departure after the lackluster results for ''[[Reach for the Sky]]''. The album garnered mixed reactions. Critics claimed it lacked the live sounding energy of the band's earlier work,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinds |first=Andy |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r87182 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Detonator - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> while some claim the sound more akin to [[hair metal]] (especially when compared to their raw early works), but still showing a band of experienced and refined musicians maturing and striving to expand their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ratt/detonator/ |title=Detonator by Ratt : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> ''Detonator'' featured among its tracks, \"[[Givin' Yourself Away]]\" (Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience's only power ballad, co-written by Pearcy and [[Diane Warren]]) and \"[[Lovin' You's a Dirty Job]]\". The band co-wrote most of the album's songs with [[Desmond Child]] while [[Jon Bon Jovi]] appeared as a guest background vocalist on \"Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\". ''Detonator'''s sales were around 800-900,000. Robbin Crosby played on the album (acknowledged in a KNAC interview), despite rumors to the contrary. (Juan Croucier stated on his message board that Crosby's guitar parts are on the disc but were low in the mix.) Plagued by addiction for some time, Crosby authored just one song, \"Can't Wait on Love\", and contributed notably to another, \"All or Nothing\". Crosby entered a rehab facility during the early stages of recording.\n\nDuring the seven shows of the Japanese leg of the 'Detonator' tour in February 1991, Crosby's substance abuse had reached a point where his playing had become increasingly inconsistent onstage. The band had already removed the acoustic intro to \"Back for More\", which Crosby performed, along with modifying sections of other songs that featured him as lead guitarist. During one particular show, after the band performed two songs using non-standard tunings, Crosby did not properly switch out guitars with his guitar technician. As a result, he was not in tune with the band for the next two songs. The last show of the Japanese tour, in Osaka, turned out to be Crosby's last with Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience. He would not record or perform with the band again.\n\nWhen the band returned to the United States, Crosby checked again into a rehab facility and Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience continued on with [[Michael Schenker]], formerly of [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Michael Schenker Group]], and [[McAuley Schenker Group]].\n\n===Downfall of their career (1991\u20131992)===\nBobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience was featured on the first season of [[MTV Unplugged]] to promote their most current album and new single, sharing the stage with all-female rock band [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]]. [[Michael Schenker]] performed with Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience at the time of this taping.\n\nAt the end of 1991, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience released the final single of their career, until 2010's [[Best of Me (Ratt song)|Best of Me]]. \"[[Nobody Rides for Free]]\" which appeared on ''[[Point Break]]'''s soundtrack album. The song and video clearly signaled a change in the band. Robbin Crosby did not participate in the recording of the song and was not present for the shooting of the video in which only the four remaining members appeared.\n\nThe band never again recorded or performed with the original five members.\n\nAtlantic Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled ''[[Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience & Roll 81-91]]'' in September 1991. The album featured five songs from ''Detonator'', more than any other album featured on the compilation. It also featured the aforementioned song \"Nobody Rides for Free\".\n\n===Hiatus (1992\u20131996)===\nIn February 1992, Stephen Pearcy exited the group to form a new hard rock band, with former [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] drummer [[Fred Coury]] called [[Arcade (band)|Arcade]], before moving on to [[Vicious Delite]] in 1995 and the industrial-tinged [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] in 1996.\n\n[[Robbin Crosby]] started Secret Service, which included bassist Krys Baratto ([[Samantha 7]], Juice 13). In 1993, Crosby performed on Rumbledog's self-titled debut album.\n\n[[Warren DeMartini]] (who had left after Pearcy in '92) was in [[Whitesnake]] in 1994 and issued two solo releases: the single \"Surf's Up!\" in 1995 and the album ''[[Crazy Enough to Sing to You]]'' in 1996.\n\nBobby Blotzer started numerous small business endeavors, most notably a carpet cleaning business, and had fill in spots with Montrose. Juan Croucier continued to produce underground bands from his studio called 'The Cellar' and, in 1994, received a lifetime achievement award in Los Angeles. During that year, Crosby was diagnosed with HIV, which later developed into AIDS.\n\n===First reunion and self-titled album (1996\u20132000)===\nIn 1996, the five classic era members of Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience began discussing a reunion and a subsequent album after their publishing contract had to be renewed. After meeting with Crosby, it was decided that he was not in any physical shape to record or perform with the band. As the talks continued to progress, bassist Juan Croucier made the decision not to participate in the reunion as well. [[Rudy Sarzo]] was first thought as a replacement, but he would end up rejoining [[Quiet Riot]] in January 1997. Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience eventually moved forward with Pearcy, DeMartini and Blotzer, along with new member, [[Robbie Crane]] (formerly of [[Vince Neil]]'s solo band and Pearcy's [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] tour) on bass. When the band toured in 1997, they were a four-piece; Pearcy occasionally played guitar during this tour.\n\nThe band issued a compilation album called ''[[Collage (Ratt album)|Collage]]'' in July 1997, which consisted of B-sides, alternate recordings, and new versions of songs from the Bobby Blotzer's Mikkey Ratt Experience period. In 1998, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience secured a worldwide record deal with [[Sony]]. The self-titled ''[[Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience (album)|Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience]]'' album, released in July 1999, featured new material with a more conventional blues rock feel.\nWith A&R guru [[John Kalodner]] in control over how the album turned out, bringing in outside writers in the process, the album did not come close to the platinum success that Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience typically achieved, though the album's first single, \"Over the Edge\", did graze the Top 40 Mainstream Rock charts.\n\n===Two versions of Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience, and death of Robbin Crosby (2000\u20132006)===\nIn 1999 Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience added [[Keri Kelli]] as a second guitarist. In January 2000, Pearcy left the group again and went on tour with his band Nitronic, which soon after became \"Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience Featuring Stephen Pearcy\". In this period, his record label Top Fuel Records released some archived Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience material and Pearcy solo work.\n\nIn 2001, former guitarist Robbin Crosby publicly announced that he was [[HIV]]-positive. He died on June 6, 2002 from a heroin overdose. He was 42 years old.<ref name=\"latimes2002\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 2006, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience was profiled on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''. In the episode, it was revealed for the first time publicly that former guitarist Robbin Crosby died of a heroin overdose, and not AIDS-related complications as was sometimes erroneously reported.\n\nDuring the group's inactive years, present-day and former members continued to work on their own side projects.  <ref>|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123537/http://geocities.com/angelcityoutlaws/bio.html |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> DeMartini and Jizzy Pearl worked on their respective solo careers and continued to record new material. In a surprising turn of events, Croucier (with Liquid Sunday) and Pearcy toured with one another during the summer and fall of 2006. Even further surprising many, Blotzer joined them onstage at a show on October 27, 2006.\n\n2018 the band Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience reunites with original members Stephen Pearcy and Juan Croucier, with new members Jordan Ziff and Chris Sanders on guitars, and Pete Holmes on drums. the band toured thru 2019 and announced their \"World Infestation\" Tour 2020. www.thebobbyblotzersrattexperiencepack.com\n\n===Second reunion (2006\u20132008)===\nOn December 1, 2006 the website \"Metal Sludge\" generated rumors after reporting that Pearcy and Croucier would re-unite with Blotzer and DeMartini.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206015745/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1454&Itemid=42|title=Wayback Machine|date=December 6, 2006|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> On December 4, 2006, Jizzy Pearl announced on his message board that he was no longer a member of the band, further increasing speculation and excitement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jizzypearl.com/ |title=home |publisher=jizzypearl.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref> On March 17, 2007, another website stated that  Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience would go on the 2007 tour with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Great White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/62399|title=POISON, RATT And GREAT WHITE To Tour Together This Summer|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref> On April 12, ''[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|Bravewords]]'' reported that [[White Lion]] would open for Poison and Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience, while Great White was still \"in talks\" to join the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/64002|title=WHITE LION Confirmed To Open For Upcoming POISON, Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience North American Tour|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref>\n\nOn March 20, 2007, the official Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience website was finally updated with only the band's logo after a year and a half of being dormant.

In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Crystal Pystal. The name Crystal Pystal turned into Mickey Ratt in 1976.\n\nGuitarist [[Robbin Crosby]] in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Asakawa.\n\nMickey Ratt went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists [[Jake E. Lee]], [[Chris Hager]], and Bob DeLellis, bassists [[Matt Thorr]], Tim Garcia, and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording on Pearcy's indie record label Top Fuel Records.\n\nIn 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called \"Dr. Rock\" / \"Drivin' on E\", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.\n\nIn 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist [[Warren DeMartini]], recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early \"Tell the World\" written by Pearcy was their first recording that was featured on the compilation ''[[Metal Massacre|Metal Massacre I]]'') temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of [[Bobby Blotzer]] (ex-Vic Vergeat) and [[Juan Croucier]] (previously with [[Dokken]], and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. [[Marq Torien]] briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/tags/marq-torien|title=Marq Torien|newspaper=MelodicRock.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref>\n\n===''Ratt EP'' (1983)===\nIn July 1983, Ratt signed with recording label Time Coast Music. Later that same year, Time Coast released in the United States the band's six-track debut [[Extended Play|EP]], simply titled ''[[Ratt (EP)|Ratt]]''. Newly formed independent UK label [[Music for Nations]] released a seven-track version of the EP in Europe, which included the additional track \"You're in Trouble\".\n\nStephen Pearcy wrote four of the six songs that were written back in the Mickey Ratt days circa 1977-81. Pearcy and Robbin Crosby co-wrote the first single, \"You Think You're Tough\", that found its way onto local radio stations KLOS and KMET.\n\n===''Out of the Cellar'' (1984)===\nThe self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] which signed them. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent [[Van Halen]] and [[Aerosmith]]-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, [[staccato]] guitar-picking style of [[Judas Priest]]. [[Tawny Kitaen]], who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \"Back for More\" and on their EP from the previous year.\n\nThe album scored much radio and [[MTV]] play with songs like \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[Wanted Man (Ratt song)|Wanted Man]]\", \"Back for More\", and \"[[Lack of Communication (song)|Lack of Communication]]\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. [[Milton Berle]]'s guest appearance, dressed in his [[Uncle Miltie]] drag character, in the video for \"Round and Round\" helped draw even more attention to the band.\n\n''Out of the Cellar'' became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Ratt stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as [[Billy Squier]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Twisted Sister]] and [[Lita Ford]]. ''Out of the Cellar'' is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 1980s heavy metal, while \"Round and Round\" scored at No.&nbsp;61 on [[VH1]]'s ''Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show''.\n\n===''Invasion of Your Privacy'' (1985\u20131986)===\nThe band's second full-length album ''[[Invasion of Your Privacy]]'' was released July 1985.\nIt peaked at No.&nbsp;7 (which is the same position that ''[[Out of the Cellar]]'' peaked). The album met mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. Allmusic.com has called it \"another batch of solid pop-metal tunes\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r16197 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Invasion of Your Privacy - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> It contained the favorites \"[[You're in Love (Ratt song)|You're in Love]]\" and \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\" (which made No.&nbsp;40 on the Hot 100) that assured the band a presence on radio and MTV. Footage from the band's performances at [[Hirsch Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] were featured in the video to \"You're In Love\".\n\nDeMartini and Crosby's impressive guitar solos and Pearcy's highly sexual lyrics helped to further define the Ratt sound. Although it did not achieve the sales figures or the status of their debut, ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' nonetheless was certified double platinum (selling over two million copies) and remains highly regarded amongst fans.\n\nA couple months after the album release, the band released a home video titled ''[[Ratt: The Video]]''. The video featured the music videos from the Ratt EP, ''Out of the Cellar'' and ''Invasion of Your Privacy''. The video is currently out of print and is very rare and difficult to find. The video was the first commercially available video to certify Gold sales status in the USA and eventually reached Platinum.\n\nThe model on ''Invasion'''s cover is ''Playboy'' [[Playmate]] [[Marianne Gravatte]], who also made an appearance in the \"Lay It Down\" music video. Using a beautiful female model on an album cover later became a trend copied by many glam metal bands of the 1980s, such as [[Great White]], and [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], who coincidentally featured Robbin Crosby's wife on the cover of their debut album. Pearcy himself soon posed for Playgirl (August '86 issue). ''Invasion of Your Privacy'' was also one of the many albums that received the attention of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] since the cover and the album title were a reference to [[voyeurism]].{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} The [[Tipper Gore]]-led organization presented it at a [[U.S. Congress]]ional hearing on September 19, 1985 dealing with [[parental advisory]] labels on albums that display \"inappropriate\" content.\nThe band toured extensively in the United States and Japan sharing stage with the likes of [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. In August 1985 the band played on the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Castle Donington, England, along with [[ZZ Top]], Bon Jovi, [[Metallica]] and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\n===''Dancing Undercover'' (1986\u20131987)===\nRatt's next release was ''[[Dancing Undercover]]'' in September 1986. The album was a relative disappointment with most music critics at the time of its release. From a commercial standpoint however, the album kept Ratt's string of consecutive Platinum albums alive. This is the first album as well to see Crosby's lead guitar duties minimized in favor of DeMartini.\n\nIn an effort to be taken more seriously, Ratt broke from the tradition of featuring a girl on the cover. They instead opted for gritty black-and-white photos of each of the five band members. Likewise, the album does not contain a single power ballad amongst its ten tracks and even features experimental forays into [[thrash metal|thrashier]] and [[heavy metal music|heavier]] sounds.\n\nThe song that reflected this most strikingly was \"[[Body Talk (Ratt song)|Body Talk]]\", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1986 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[The Golden Child]]''. The more straight-ahead style of the album (especially with this song) led many fans to believe that Ratt was headed in a direction more akin to the [[thrash metal|thrash]] style promulgated by such bands as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]]. However, that proved not to be the case as the slightly [[experimental music|experimental]] undertones of the album were quickly replaced with a [[blues music|bluesier]] sound throughout their next three releases.\n\nOther popular tracks generated by the album included \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\" and \"[[Slip of the Lip]]\".\nThrough 1987, Ratt embarked on a U.S. tour with newcomers [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and played in Europe as a part of the Monsters Of Rock Tour (widely bootlegged). Their tour with Poison was one of the highest grossing tours of 1987. Ratt also played Madison Square Garden.\n\n===''Reach for the Sky'' (1988\u20131989)===\nThe group's follow-up, ''[[Reach for the Sky (Ratt album)|Reach for the Sky]]'' was released in November 1988. Although the album achieved Platinum sales status and reached No.&nbsp;17 on Billboard's album charts, it was widely panned by critics. Complaints ranged from it being formulaic and sophomoric to the album being uneven and lacking in focus. After this album, the band parted ways with long-time producer [[Beau Hill]]. For all the criticisms, ''Reach for the Sky'' nevertheless contained the popular tracks \"[[Way Cool Jr.]]\" and \"[[I Want a Woman]]\" which received their usual MTV airplay. Those two songs are now regarded as glam metal classics.\n\nThe surreal, Dali-esque album cover featured a statue wearing [[night vision goggles]], a human hand emerging from a bundle of [[twine]], a [[World War II]] fighter plane, and a [[wicker]] chair. The band has remained mum as to what the album cover is supposed to symbolize so as to facilitate the diverse interpretations of their fans. Early pressings of the album cover revealed the [[breast]] part of the statue as requested by lead singer Stephen Pearcy. According to Pearcy, he wanted to use that version of the cover but the other band members feared that this would keep the record out of certain music stores. The revised version of the album contained the same tracks, but in a different order. After the revised version hit the record stores, producer Beau Hill stepped down from producer duties and tensions within the band increased.\nThe band started the new year with a concert at the Tokyo Dome headlined by Bon Jovi The other bands in the bill were Kingdom Come and Britny Fox. Ratt soon played the Tokyo Dome on their own. Both appearances have been widely bootlegged.\nThe tour that followed in the spring of '89 (supported by Kix, Warrant and Britny Fox) was eventually cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\n\n===''Detonator'' (1990\u20131991)===\nRatt's fifth album ''[[Detonator (album)|Detonator]]'' was released in August 1990. Sir Arthur Payson took over as producer for the band following [[Beau Hill]]'s departure after the lackluster results for ''[[Reach for the Sky]]''. The album garnered mixed reactions. Critics claimed it lacked the live sounding energy of the band's earlier work,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinds |first=Andy |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r87182 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Detonator - Ratt |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> while some claim the sound more akin to [[hair metal]] (especially when compared to their raw early works), but still showing a band of experienced and refined musicians maturing and striving to expand their sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ratt/detonator/ |title=Detonator by Ratt : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> ''Detonator'' featured among its tracks, \"[[Givin' Yourself Away]]\" (Ratt's only power ballad, co-written by Pearcy and [[Diane Warren]]) and \"[[Lovin' You's a Dirty Job]]\". The band co-wrote most of the album's songs with [[Desmond Child]] while [[Jon Bon Jovi]] appeared as a guest background vocalist on \"Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\". ''Detonator'''s sales were around 800-900,000. Robbin Crosby played on the album (acknowledged in a KNAC interview), despite rumors to the contrary. (Juan Croucier stated on his message board that Crosby's guitar parts are on the disc but were low in the mix.) Plagued by addiction for some time, Crosby authored just one song, \"Can't Wait on Love\", and contributed notably to another, \"All or Nothing\". Crosby entered a rehab facility during the early stages of recording.\n\nDuring the seven shows of the Japanese leg of the 'Detonator' tour in February 1991, Crosby's substance abuse had reached a point where his playing had become increasingly inconsistent onstage. The band had already removed the acoustic intro to \"Back for More\", which Crosby performed, along with modifying sections of other songs that featured him as lead guitarist. During one particular show, after the band performed two songs using non-standard tunings, Crosby did not properly switch out guitars with his guitar technician. As a result, he was not in tune with the band for the next two songs. The last show of the Japanese tour, in Osaka, turned out to be Crosby's last with Ratt. He would not record or perform with the band again.\n\nWhen the band returned to the United States, Crosby checked again into a rehab facility and Ratt continued on with [[Michael Schenker]], formerly of [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Michael Schenker Group]], and [[McAuley Schenker Group]].\n\n===Downfall of their career (1991\u20131992)===\nRatt was featured on the first season of [[MTV Unplugged]] to promote their most current album and new single, sharing the stage with all-female rock band [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]]. [[Michael Schenker]] performed with Ratt at the time of this taping.\n\nAt the end of 1991, Ratt released the final single of their career, until 2010's [[Best of Me (Ratt song)|Best of Me]]. \"[[Nobody Rides for Free]]\" which appeared on ''[[Point Break]]'''s soundtrack album. The song and video clearly signaled a change in the band. Robbin Crosby did not participate in the recording of the song and was not present for the shooting of the video in which only the four remaining members appeared.\n\nThe band never again recorded or performed with the original five members.\n\nAtlantic Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled ''[[Ratt & Roll 81-91]]'' in September 1991. The album featured five songs from ''Detonator'', more than any other album featured on the compilation. It also featured the aforementioned song \"Nobody Rides for Free\".\n\n===Hiatus (1992\u20131996)===\nIn February 1992, Stephen Pearcy exited the group to form a new hard rock band, with former [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] drummer [[Fred Coury]] called [[Arcade (band)|Arcade]], before moving on to [[Vicious Delite]] in 1995 and the industrial-tinged [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] in 1996.\n\n[[Robbin Crosby]] started Secret Service, which included bassist Krys Baratto ([[Samantha 7]], Juice 13). In 1993, Crosby performed on Rumbledog's self-titled debut album.\n\n[[Warren DeMartini]] (who had left after Pearcy in '92) was in [[Whitesnake]] in 1994 and issued two solo releases: the single \"Surf's Up!\" in 1995 and the album ''[[Crazy Enough to Sing to You]]'' in 1996.\n\nBobby Blotzer started numerous small business endeavors, most notably a carpet cleaning business, and had fill in spots with Montrose. Juan Croucier continued to produce underground bands from his studio called 'The Cellar' and, in 1994, received a lifetime achievement award in Los Angeles. During that year, Crosby was diagnosed with HIV, which later developed into AIDS.\n\n===First reunion and self-titled album (1996\u20132000)===\nIn 1996, the five classic era members of Ratt began discussing a reunion and a subsequent album after their publishing contract had to be renewed. After meeting with Crosby, it was decided that he was not in any physical shape to record or perform with the band. As the talks continued to progress, bassist Juan Croucier made the decision not to participate in the reunion as well. [[Rudy Sarzo]] was first thought as a replacement, but he would end up rejoining [[Quiet Riot]] in January 1997. Ratt eventually moved forward with Pearcy, DeMartini and Blotzer, along with new member, [[Robbie Crane]] (formerly of [[Vince Neil]]'s solo band and Pearcy's [[Vertex (band)|Vertex]] tour) on bass. When the band toured in 1997, they were a four-piece; Pearcy occasionally played guitar during this tour.\n\nThe band issued a compilation album called ''[[Collage (Ratt album)|Collage]]'' in July 1997, which consisted of B-sides, alternate recordings, and new versions of songs from the Mickey Ratt period. In 1998, Ratt secured a worldwide record deal with [[Sony]]. The self-titled ''[[Ratt (album)|Ratt]]'' album, released in July 1999, featured new material with a more conventional blues rock feel.\nWith A&R guru [[John Kalodner]] in control over how the album turned out, bringing in outside writers in the process, the album did not come close to the platinum success that Ratt typically achieved, though the album's first single, \"Over the Edge\", did graze the Top 40 Mainstream Rock charts.\n\n===Two versions of Ratt, and death of Robbin Crosby (2000\u20132006)===\nIn 1999 Ratt added [[Keri Kelli]] as a second guitarist. In January 2000, Pearcy left the group again and went on tour with his band Nitronic, which soon after became \"Ratt Featuring Stephen Pearcy\". In this period, his record label Top Fuel Records released some archived Ratt material and Pearcy solo work.\n\nIn 2001, former guitarist Robbin Crosby publicly announced that he was [[HIV]]-positive. He died on June 6, 2002 from a heroin overdose. He was 42 years old.<ref name=\"latimes2002\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 2006, Ratt was profiled on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''. In the episode, it was revealed for the first time publicly that former guitarist Robbin Crosby died of a heroin overdose, and not AIDS-related complications as was sometimes erroneously reported.\n\nDuring the group's inactive years, present-day and former members continued to work on their own side projects.  <ref>|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123537/http://geocities.com/angelcityoutlaws/bio.html |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> DeMartini and Jizzy Pearl worked on their respective solo careers and continued to record new material. In a surprising turn of events, Croucier (with Liquid Sunday) and Pearcy toured with one another during the summer and fall of 2006. Even further surprising many, Blotzer joined them onstage at a show on October 27, 2006.\n\n2018 the band Ratt reunites with original members Stephen Pearcy and Juan Croucier, with new members Jordan Ziff and Chris Sanders on guitars, and Pete Holmes on drums. the band toured thru 2019 and announced their \"World Infestation\" Tour 2020. www.therattpack.com\n\n===Second reunion (2006\u20132008)===\nOn December 1, 2006 the website \"Metal Sludge\" generated rumors after reporting that Pearcy and Croucier would re-unite with Blotzer and DeMartini.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206015745/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1454&Itemid=42|title=Wayback Machine|date=December 6, 2006|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> On December 4, 2006, Jizzy Pearl announced on his message board that he was no longer a member of the band, further increasing speculation and excitement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jizzypearl.com/ |title=home |publisher=jizzypearl.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref> On March 17, 2007, another website stated that Ratt would go on the 2007 tour with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Great White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/62399|title=POISON, RATT And GREAT WHITE To Tour Together This Summer|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref> On April 12, ''[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|Bravewords]]'' reported that [[White Lion]] would open for Poison and Ratt, while Great White was still \"in talks\" to join the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/64002|title=WHITE LION Confirmed To Open For Upcoming POISON, RATT North American Tour|publisher=Bravewords.com}}</ref>\n\nOn March 20, 2007, the official Ratt website was finally updated with only the band's logo after a year and a half of being dormant.

The tour, which brought Poison and Ratt onstage together for the first time since 1999, visited amphitheaters, festivals and fairs in such cities as Boston, Detroit, New York, Atlantic City and Los Angeles.\n\nFestivals the tour performed at include Birmingham, Ala.'s City Stages (June 16), Pryor, Okla.'s Rocklahoma (July 13), Sturgis, S.D.'s Buffalo Chip (August 5) and Newton, IA, Iowa Speedway (August 4).\n\nOn July 31, 2007, Ratt released a DVD entitled ''Ratt - Videos from the Cellar: The Atlantic Years'' which chronicles the band's video history.

Throughout October the band was to tour Europe, but instead, the band planned to return in June 2008 to perform at some of Europe's most popular rock festivals including Spring and Airbrake as well as several other key dates in the UK and Scandinavia. At the end of January 2008 they played at Motley Cruise, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean (Miami, Key West and Cozumel, MX)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motleycruise.com |title=Vince Neil's Music Cruise |publisher=Motleycruise.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> with [[Vince Neil]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], [[Endeverafter]], and [[Lynam (band)|Lynam]].\n\nIn May and June 2008, Ratt toured Europe.
