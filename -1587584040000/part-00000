Before becoming a coach, Rivera played [[college football]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was recognized as an [[All-American]] [[linebacker]] for the [[California Golden Bears football|California Golden Bears]]. He was selected in the second round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]] by the [[Chicago Bears]], and was a part of the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 team]] that won [[Super Bowl XX]]. He spent nine years playing for them before retiring after the 1992 season.\n\nRivera's coaching career began in 1997 when he joined the Bears as a [[quality control coach]]. He then joined the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] as a linebackers coach in 1999 before rejoining the Bears to become their [[defensive coordinator]] in 2004. With them, the Bears made an appearance in [[Super Bowl XLI]]. He then joined the [[San Diego Chargers]] as a linebackers coach in 2007 before serving as their defensive coordinator for the next three seasons.\n\nIn 2011, Rivera became the head coach for the [[Carolina Panthers]]. With them, Rivera became their all-time winning coach and was recognized twice as [[NFL Coach of the Year]] in 2013 and 2015, while also leading the team to an appearance in [[Super Bowl 50]].

Football League]] (NFL). Before becoming a coach, Rivera played [[college football]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was recognized as an [[All-American]] [[linebacker]] for the [[California Golden Bears football|California Golden Bears]]. He was selected in the second round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]] by the [[Chicago Bears]], and was a part of the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 team]] that won [[Super Bowl XX]]. He spent nine years playing for them before retiring after the 1992 season.\n\nRivera's coaching career began in 1997 when he joined the Bears as a [[quality control coach]]. He then joined the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] as a linebackers coach in 1999 before rejoining the Bears to become their [[defensive coordinator]] in 2004. With them, the Bears made an appearance in [[Super Bowl XLI]]. He then joined the [[San Diego Chargers]] as a linebackers coach in 2007 before serving as their defensive coordinator for the next three seasons.\n\nIn 2011, Rivera became the head coach for the [[Carolina Panthers]].

The club averaged 19,491 fans per game, with three matches surpassing 21,000, one reaching 33,000 and still another topping 45,000.\n\n==== Regular season standings ====\n''W = Wins, L = Losses, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, BP = Bonus Points, Pts= point system''\n\n6 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, 1 point for each regulation goal scored up to three per game.\n:''{{Color box|#B3B7FF|border=darkgray}}-League Premiers (most points). {{Color box|#ccffcc|border=darkgray}}-Other playoff teams.''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:470px;

It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing first in the [[American League East]] with a record of 89 wins and 73 losses. They lost the [[1989 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in five games to the eventual World Series champion [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. It was the team's last season at [[Exhibition Stadium]], before moving to [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] halfway into the season. The Blue Jays hit eight [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slams]], the most in MLB in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/HUuaW|title=Team Batting Event Finder: 1989, All Teams, Home Runs, With Runners on 123|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\n* October 9, 1988: [[Carlos Delgado]] was signed as an amateur free agent by the Blue Jays.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/d/delgaca01.shtml Carlos Delgado] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* December 6, 1988: [[Mauro Gozzo]] was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Kansas City Royals in the 1988 minor league draft.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gozzoma01.shtml</ref>\n* December 22, 1988: [[Cecil Fielder]] was purchased from the Blue Jays by the [[Hanshin Tigers]] (Japan Central).<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/fieldce01.shtml Cecil Fielder] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* December 24, 1988: [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] was signed as a free agent by the Blue Jays.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/flanami01.shtml Mike Flanagan] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* January 18, 1989: [[Bob Brenly]] was signed as a free agent by the Blue Jays.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/b/brenlbo01.shtml Bob Brenly] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* March 9, 1989: [[DeWayne Buice]] was traded by the California Angels to the Toronto Blue Jays for [[Cliff Young (baseball)|Cliff Young]].<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/buicede01.shtml</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\nThe regular season would represent a turning point for the Blue Jays in many different ways. The Blue Jays started the 1989 season in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] against the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]]. Behind the pitching of [[Jimmy Key]], the Jays won the first game of the season 4-3.<ref name=p230>Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, Stephen Brunt, p.230, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-023978-2}}</ref> The rest of the month would result in a losing record for the Jays. After the first month of the season, the Blue Jays had 10 wins and 20 losses and sat 6.5 games behind the [[1989 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the standings. The result was that [[Pat Gillick]] made his first trade in 605 days.<ref name=p230/> On April 30, Gillick sent [[Jesse Barfield]] to the [[1989 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in exchange for [[Al Leiter]].<ref name=p230/> The reason for the deal was that management was convinced that [[Rob Ducey]] was ready to be an everyday outfielder. The spot eventually went to the surprising [[Junior Felix]] that year, and Ducey never became the everyday player the Jays imagined him to be.\n\nThe Blue Jays had never fired a manager in the middle of the season. After the Jays were swept by the [[1989 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] in a three-game series, including a 13-1 loss in the final game of the series, the Jays had 12 wins and 24 losses.<ref name=p231>Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, Stephen Brunt, p.231, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-023978-2}}</ref> The Jays had also lost 15 of their last 19 games. Gillick decided that a change was needed. On Monday, May 15, [[Jimy Williams]] had become the first Jays manager to be fired in mid-season.<ref name=p232>Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, Stephen Brunt, p.232, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-023978-2}}</ref>  Williams would be replaced by [[Cito Gaston]], the first black manager in the history of the franchise.\n\nThe Blue Jays' last game at Exhibition Stadium was against the first team they played there, the [[Chicago White Sox]]. From there, the Blue Jays opened the new Skydome with a loss to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. On September 30, they clinched the American League East division title at the new ballpark.\n\n===Notable games===\n* April 16, 1989 &ndash; Blue Jays third baseman [[Kelly Gruber]] hits for the cycle in a 15-8 victory over the [[1989 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]].\n* May 4, 1989 &ndash; In a game versus the [[1989 California Angels season|California Angels]], [[Junior Felix]] hits a home run in his first Major League at-bat, becoming only the 60th Major Leaguer to achieve the feat.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|title=Home Run in First At-Bat|accessdate=June 9, 2011|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats5.shtml}}</ref>\n* May 28, 1989 &ndash; The Blue Jays play their final game at [[Exhibition Stadium]], a 7-5 10-inning win over the [[1989 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. Coincidentally, the White Sox had been the Jays' opponents in their first game at Exhibition Stadium (also the first game in franchise history) twelve years before.\n* June 4, 1989 &ndash; The Blue Jays stage a remarkable comeback in a game against the [[1989 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] in [[Boston]]. Trailing 10-0 after six innings, they slowly close the gap, finally taking an 11-10 lead on a ninth-inning grand slam by [[Ernie Whitt]].

It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing first in the [[American League East]] with a record of 89 wins and 73 losses. They lost the [[1989 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in five games to the eventual World Series champion [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. It was the team's last season at [[Exhibition Stadium]], before moving to [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] halfway into the season. The Blue Jays hit eight [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slams]], the most in MLB in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/HUuaW|title=Team Batting Event Finder: 1989, All Teams, Home Runs, With Runners on 123|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\n* October 9, 1988: [[Carlos Delgado]] was signed as an amateur free agent by the Blue Jays.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/d/delgaca01.shtml Carlos Delgado] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* December 6, 1988: [[Mauro Gozzo]] was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Kansas City Royals in the 1988 minor league draft.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gozzoma01.shtml</ref>\n* December 22, 1988: [[Cecil Fielder]] was purchased from the Blue Jays by the [[Hanshin Tigers]] (Japan Central).<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/fieldce01.shtml Cecil Fielder] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* December 24, 1988: [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] was signed as a free agent by the Blue Jays.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/flanami01.shtml Mike Flanagan] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* January 18, 1989: [[Bob Brenly]] was signed as a free agent by the Blue Jays.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/b/brenlbo01.shtml Bob Brenly] at ''Baseball Reference''</ref>\n* March 9, 1989: [[DeWayne Buice]] was traded by the California Angels to the Toronto Blue Jays for [[Cliff Young (baseball)|Cliff Young]].<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/buicede01.shtml</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\nThe regular season would represent a turning point for the Blue Jays in many different ways. The Blue Jays started the 1989 season in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] against the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]]. Behind the pitching of [[Jimmy Key]], the Jays won the first game of the season 4-3.<ref name=p230>Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, Stephen Brunt, p.230, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-023978-2}}</ref> The rest of the month would result in a losing record for the Jays. After the first month of the season, the Blue Jays had 10 wins and 20 losses and sat 6.5 games behind the [[1989 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the standings. The result was that [[Pat Gillick]] made his first trade in 605 days.<ref name=p230/> On April 30, Gillick sent [[Jesse Barfield]] to the [[1989 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in exchange for [[Al Leiter]].<ref name=p230/> The reason for the deal was that management was convinced that [[Rob Ducey]] was ready to be an everyday outfielder. The spot eventually went to the surprising [[Junior Felix]] that year, and Ducey never became the everyday player the Jays imagined him to be.\n\nThe Blue Jays had never fired a manager in the middle of the season. After the Jays were swept by the [[1989 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] in a three-game series, including a 13-1 loss in the final game of the series, the Jays had 12 wins and 24 losses.<ref name=p231>Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, Stephen Brunt, p.231, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-023978-2}}</ref> The Jays had also lost 15 of their last 19 games. Gillick decided that a change was needed. On Monday, May 15, [[Jimy Williams]] had become the first Jays manager to be fired in mid-season.<ref name=p232>Diamond Dreams: 20 Years of Blue Jays Baseball, Stephen Brunt, p.232, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-14-023978-2}}</ref>  Williams would be replaced by [[Cito Gaston]], the first black manager in the history of the franchise.\n\nThe Blue Jays' last game at Exhibition Stadium was against the first team they played there, the [[Chicago White Sox]]. From there, the Blue Jays opened the new Skydome with a loss to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. On September 30, they clinched the American League East division title at the new ballpark.\n\n===Notable games===\n* April 16, 1989 &ndash; Blue Jays third baseman [[Kelly Gruber]] hits for the cycle in a 15-8 victory over the [[1989 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]].\n* May 4, 1989 &ndash; In a game versus the [[1989 California Angels season|California Angels]], [[Junior Felix]] hits a home run in his first Major League at-bat, becoming only the 60th Major Leaguer to achieve the feat.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|title=Home Run in First At-Bat|accessdate=June 9, 2011|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats5.shtml}}</ref>\n* May 28, 1989 &ndash; The Blue Jays play their final game at [[Exhibition Stadium]], a 7-5 10-inning win over the [[1989 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. Coincidentally, the White Sox had been the Jays' opponents in their first game at Exhibition Stadium (also the first game in franchise history) twelve years before.\n* June 4, 1989 &ndash; The Blue Jays stage a remarkable comeback in a game against the [[1989 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] in [[Boston]]. Trailing 10-0 after six innings, they slowly close the gap, finally taking an 11-10 lead on a ninth-inning grand slam by [[Ernie Whitt]]. Boston ties the score in the bottom half of the inning, but [[Junior Felix]] smokes a two-run home run in the top of the 12th inning, giving Toronto a 13-11 victory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelly |first=Cathal |title=Red-hot Jays burn hole in Bosox |url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/480296 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gcvAY4Hr?url=http://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/480296 |archivedate=May 8, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Jays, Down by 10-0, Stun Red Sox, 13-11|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/sports/jays-down-by-10-0-stun-red-sox-13-11.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 5, 1989|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}</ref>\n* June 5, 1989 &ndash; The Blue Jays play their first game in the brand-new [[SkyDome]], a 5-3 loss to the [[1989 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]].<ref>{{cite web|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Blue Jays Open the SkyDome but Lose|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/06/sports/blue-jays-open-the-skydome-but-lose.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 6, 1989|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}</ref>\n* August 4, 1989 &ndash; With the Blue Jays leading the [[New York Yankees]] 2-0, [[Dave Stieb]] comes one out away from pitching a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]], but the Yankees' [[Roberto Kelly]] cracks a double into left field to break it up.

It explores the concept of [[immortality]], which might not be as desirable as it may appear to be. It has sold over 5 million copies and has been called a classic of modern children's literature.  The book is also sold with the reading connections included.\n\n''Tuck Everlasting'' has been adapted into two feature films, released in [[Tuck Everlasting (1981 film)|1981]] and [[Tuck Everlasting (2002 film)|2002]], and three times  into unabridged audio books:<!-- out of place in lead --> by Listening Library/Random House in 1988 and narrated by Peter Thomas, by [[Recorded Books]] in 1993 and narrated by Barbara Caruso, and by Audio Bookshelf in 2001 and narrated by Melissa Hughes. It has also been adapted into a [[Tuck Everlasting (musical)|stage musical]] with music by Chris Miller, lyrics by Nathan Tysen, and book by [[Claudia Shear]] and [[Tim Federle]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nEleven-year-old Winifred \"Winnie\" Foster is frustrated with her family because they keep her cooped up in the house, and considers running away from her home in rural Treegap. One day, while in a wooded area her family owns, she sees a boy of about 17 drinking from a spring. He introduces himself as Jesse Tuck and tells her not to drink the spring water. Soon after, his brother Miles and his mother Mae take her away with them. On the way, they are pursued by a man in a yellow suit, who had approached the Fosters asking questions about their land the day before.\n\nThe Tucks explain to Winnie that the spring grants eternal life to anyone who drinks its water, effects which they discovered by accident. Winnie was the only person the Tucks granted with this information and was trusted to keep it because it might fall into the wrong hands. In the process, Miles had to cope with his wife leaving him and taking their children. They have been living in seclusion outside of Treegap for years, reuniting every ten years and drinking from the spring. Winnie grows particularly fond of Jesse and his father, Angus Tuck.\n\nMeanwhile, the man in the yellow suit has been pursuing the Tucks. Once he discovers they have taken Winifred, he steals their horse and rides it back to the Foster homestead. After he informs her family of Winnie's whereabouts, they dispatch him and the local constable to return her. However, he breaks away and rides ahead of the constable, for he has a selfish motive for finding Winnie.\n\nWhen the man in the yellow suit arrives at the Tucks' farm, he informs them that he has been searching for them for years. Miles' wife and children had come to live with his family when he was a boy, and he heard rumors of their secret. He then informs the angry family that he told the Fosters where Winnie was and that he has received a bounty in exchange for her safe return: the wooded area and with it the spring. He plans to gather the water from the spring and sell it to the public. When the Tucks refuse his offer to be partners in the venture, he declares he does not need their permission to sell the water and begins to take Winnie away. Mae finds out that the man in the yellow suit plans to make Winnie drink the water and use her for his demonstration of the water's powers. She hits him on the head with a gun barrel, fatally fracturing his skull, just as the constable arrives. Mae is arrested, condemned to the gallows and scheduled for execution the next morning.\n\nAngus, Miles, and Jesse realize that their secret will be revealed once Mae is hanged, for she will not be able to die, so they take Winnie with them and break Mae out of jail. Winnie takes her place so the Tucks can escape. Although they are reunited, there is no more reason for them to be in Treegap, as Mae is now a fugitive from justice. Before departing, Jesse gives Winnie a bottle of the special water so she might drink it when she turns 17 and follow them and marry him. She considers this, but decides not to and pours it onto a toad, also knowing she could just go to the spring if she changes her mind.\n\nMany years later, Mae and Angus Tuck return to Treegap and find that it has changed a great deal \u2013 the wooded area is gone and so is their spring; the town has become a typical suburban metropolis. While there, they visit a cemetery where they find Winnie's grave; she went on to marry, and had died two years before. Though Angus Tuck is saddened by this, he also secretly praises Winnie for choosing not to drink the water. They come across a toad near her grave and \"save\" it from a truck, unaware that it is the same one that she had poured water on years before.\n\n== Characters ==\n* Winifred \"Winnie\" Foster \u2013 The novel's protagonist, she is 11 years old when the novel begins and lives in Treegap, New Hampshire.

It explores the concept of [[immortality]], which might not be as desirable as it may appear to be. It has sold over 5 million copies and has been called a classic of modern children's literature.  The book is also sold with the reading connections included.\n\n''Tuck Everlasting'' has been adapted into two feature films, released in [[Tuck Everlasting (1981 film)|1981]] and [[Tuck Everlasting (2002 film)|2002]], and three times  into unabridged audio books:<!-- out of place in lead --> by Listening Library/Random House in 1988 and narrated by Peter Thomas, by [[Recorded Books]] in 1993 and narrated by Barbara Caruso, and by Audio Bookshelf in 2001 and narrated by Melissa Hughes. It has also been adapted into a [[Tuck Everlasting (musical)|stage musical]] with music by Chris Miller, lyrics by Nathan Tysen, and book by [[Claudia Shear]] and [[Tim Federle]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nEleven-year-old Winifred \"Winnie\" Foster is frustrated with her family because they keep her cooped up in the house, and considers running away from her home in rural Treegap. One day, while in a wooded area her family owns, she sees a boy of about 17 drinking from a spring. He introduces himself as Jesse Tuck and tells her not to drink the spring water. Soon after, his brother Miles and his mother Mae take her away with them. On the way, they are pursued by a man in a yellow suit, who had approached the Fosters asking questions about their land the day before.\n\nThe Tucks explain to Winnie that the spring grants eternal life to anyone who drinks its water, effects which they discovered by accident. Winnie was the only person the Tucks granted with this information and was trusted to keep it because it might fall into the wrong hands. In the process, Miles had to cope with his wife leaving him and taking their children. They have been living in seclusion outside of Treegap for years, reuniting every ten years and drinking from the spring. Winnie grows particularly fond of Jesse and his father, Angus Tuck.\n\nMeanwhile, the man in the yellow suit has been pursuing the Tucks. Once he discovers they have taken Winifred, he steals their horse and rides it back to the Foster homestead. After he informs her family of Winnie's whereabouts, they dispatch him and the local constable to return her. However, he breaks away and rides ahead of the constable, for he has a selfish motive for finding Winnie.\n\nWhen the man in the yellow suit arrives at the Tucks' farm, he informs them that he has been searching for them for years. Miles' wife and children had come to live with his family when he was a boy, and he heard rumors of their secret. He then informs the angry family that he told the Fosters where Winnie was and that he has received a bounty in exchange for her safe return: the wooded area and with it the spring. He plans to gather the water from the spring and sell it to the public. When the Tucks refuse his offer to be partners in the venture, he declares he does not need their permission to sell the water and begins to take Winnie away. Mae finds out that the man in the yellow suit plans to make Winnie drink the water and use her for his demonstration of the water's powers. She hits him on the head with a gun barrel, fatally fracturing his skull, just as the constable arrives. Mae is arrested, condemned to the gallows and scheduled for execution the next morning.\n\nAngus, Miles, and Jesse realize that their secret will be revealed once Mae is hanged, for she will not be able to die, so they take Winnie with them and break Mae out of jail. Winnie takes her place so the Tucks can escape. Although they are reunited, there is no more reason for them to be in Treegap, as Mae is now a fugitive from justice. Before departing, Jesse gives Winnie a bottle of the special water so she might drink it when she turns 17 and follow them and marry him. She considers this, but decides not to and pours it onto a toad, also knowing she could just go to the spring if she changes her mind.\n\nMany years later, Mae and Angus Tuck return to Treegap and find that it has changed a great deal \u2013 the wooded area is gone and so is their spring; the town has become a typical suburban metropolis. While there, they visit a cemetery where they find Winnie's grave; she went on to marry, and had died two years before. Though Angus Tuck is saddened by this, he also secretly praises Winnie for choosing not to drink the water. They come across a toad near her grave and \"save\" it from a truck, unaware that it is the same one that she had poured water on years before.\n\n== Characters ==\n* Winifred \"Winnie\" Foster \u2013 The novel's protagonist, she is 11 years old when the novel begins and lives in Treegap, New Hampshire.

After he attended business school, he returned to the supermarket. His family established a driving school that provided the funds for Pagenaud to begin his racing career.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Bruce|title=Say Cheese|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=20 February 2017|pages=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nPagenaud competed in 2002 and 2003 in French [[Formula Renault]] and in 2002 and 2004 competed in Formula Renault Eurocup. He then moved up to the [[World Series by Renault|Formula Renault 3.5 Series]] in 2005 where he finished 16th. In 2006 he went to the United States and won the [[Atlantic Championship|Champ Car Atlantic]] with [[Team Australia]] in his rookie season by just a few points over [[Graham Rahal]].\n\nWith his Atlantic championship, Pagenaud won US$2&nbsp;million to apply towards a ride in [[Champ Car]] in [[2007 Champ Car season|2007]]. On 13 February 2007 Pagenaud and Team Australia confirmed that he would be staying with the team, moving up to the Champ Car program. Pagenaud finished 8th in the  points standings in what was a very consistent debut season, with three consecutive 4th-place finishes in the Canadian rounds of the championship.\n\nAfter the demise of the Champ Car World Series, Pagenaud in 2008 moved to the [[American Le Mans Series]] co-driving the [[De Ferran Motorsports]] [[Acura ARX-01]]b LMP2 with former CART champion [[Gil de Ferran]]. He finished 14th in the drivers standings.\n\n===2009===\nIn 2009, Pagenaud and de Ferran Motorsports took huge steps forward, with the duo taking second place overall in the American Le Mans Series LMP1 class, only 17 points behind drivers [[David Brabham]] and [[Scott Sharp]] of champions [[Highcroft Racing]]. The duo of Pagenaud and de Ferran drove the ARX-01 to three wins over a total of ten races and three pole positions, turning the fastest lap of the ALMS weekend 6 times.\n\nAlso during 2009, Pagenaud drove in the prestigious [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in LMP1 for the privateer [[Pescarolo Sport]] team in the Peugeot FAP 908. The team did not finish the race, completing 210 laps. The race was won by David Brabham, driving in the factory Peugeot Sport Total No. 9 FAP 908 along with former [[Formula One]] drivers [[Alexander Wurz]] and [[Marc Gen\u00e9]].\n\n===2010===\nFor the 2010 ALMS season, Pagenaud moved over to the Patr\u00f3n Highcroft racing team, replacing Scott Sharp to co-drive with Brabham in the ARX-01c in LMP1 after Sharp vacated the seat to jump to the ALMS GT2 class with his own Ferrari team. Through four rounds in the 2010 ALMS series, the team of Pagenaud and Brabham lead the LMP1 class with three wins and 91 points.\n\nPagenaud also earned a seat driving for the [[Peugeot]] factory team  in 2010 in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans on the renown [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] in the Peugeot FAP 908 No. 3 with [[Pedro Lamy]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]].\n\nWhile the No. 3 Peugeot started from pole, it retired early before nightfall after a mere 38 laps when a suspension mount sheared from the car's tub. The same fate eventually befell the no.1 Peugeot car of [[Anthony Davidson]]/Gene/Wurz while in second place with mere hours left to go in the race, as [[Audi]] reclaimed the 24 Hours of Le Mans title it had retained for five years prior to Peugeot's 2009 win.\n\nDuring the race, Pagenaud found himself competing against his Highcroft Racing team which travelled to Le Mans for the first time in its history. With Brabham driving the Acura in LMP2 alongside [[Marino Franchitti]] and [[Marco Werner]], Highcroft maintained second through most of the race until a cooling issue sidelined the car for much of the race's final four hours.\n\n===2014===\n[[File:GoPro Grand Prix 2015 15 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Pagenaud during practice at the [[2015 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma]]]]\n\nHe won the inaugural [[Grand Prix of Indianapolis]] on 10 May.

Pagenaud ended up being over-taken by the field and went on to finish 10th, while teammate [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won the race. Pagenaud didn't win a race in 2015, but renewed his deal with TEAM Penske in 2016.\n\n=== 2016 ===\nPagenaud got off to the best start of his IndyCar career with five consecutive podiums, including three wins in a row. As the season progressed, Pagenaud and his teammate [[Will Power]] became the primary contenders for the championship. With a strong run at the end of the season, Pagenaud took his first IndyCar Series championship victory, giving Team Penske another championship victory in its 50th year of racing. He finished the season with five race victories and a total of eight podiums.\n\n=== 2017\u2013present ===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\nPagenaud would go winless throughout 2018.\nPagenaud won the Grand Prix of Indianapolis and he would also win the [[2019 Indianapolis 500]] from pole position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/motor/indycar/2019/05/26/2019-indianapolis-500-simon-pagenaud/1245105001/|title=Simon Pagenaud dominates, holds off Alexander Rossi to score first Indianapolis 500 win|last=Ayello|first=Jim|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=May 26, 2019|accessdate=July 20, 2019}}</ref> Pagenaud took the championship lead from [[Team Penske]] team mate [[Josef Newgarden]], however Newgarden would retake the championship lead one race later in Detroit.

He currently drives the No. 22 Chevrolet for [[Team Penske]] in the [[IndyCar Series]]. After a successful career in [[Sports prototype|sports car]] racing that saw him taking the top class championship title in the [[2010 American Le Mans Series]], he moved to [[Formula Racing]] in the [[Indycar Series]] where he became the [[2016 IndyCar Series|2016 IndyCar champion]] and the [[2019 Indianapolis 500]] winner, becoming the first French driver to win the Indianapolis 500 since [[Gaston Chevrolet]] in 1920 and the first polesitter to have won the race since [[Helio Castroneves]] in [[2009 Indianapolis 500|2009]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2016/09/21/breakfast-with-simon-pagenaud-newly-crowned-2016-verizon-indycar-champ/#6cf42b87d0aa|title=Breakfast With Simon Pagenaud, Newly Crowned 2016 Verizon IndyCar Champ|last=Clash|first=Jim|access-date=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Montmorillon]], Pagenaud first worked at age 14 in the family's supermarket, eventually managing the video game department. After he attended business school, he returned to the supermarket. His family established a driving school that provided the funds for Pagenaud to begin his racing career.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Bruce|title=Say Cheese|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=20 February 2017|pages=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nPagenaud competed in 2002 and 2003 in French [[Formula Renault]] and in 2002 and 2004 competed in Formula Renault Eurocup. He then moved up to the [[World Series by Renault|Formula Renault 3.5 Series]] in 2005 where he finished 16th. In 2006 he went to the United States and won the [[Atlantic Championship|Champ Car Atlantic]] with [[Team Australia]] in his rookie season by just a few points over [[Graham Rahal]].\n\nWith his Atlantic championship, Pagenaud won US$2&nbsp;million to apply towards a ride in [[Champ Car]] in [[2007 Champ Car season|2007]]. On 13 February 2007 Pagenaud and Team Australia confirmed that he would be staying with the team, moving up to the Champ Car program. Pagenaud finished 8th in the  points standings in what was a very consistent debut season, with three consecutive 4th-place finishes in the Canadian rounds of the championship.\n\nAfter the demise of the Champ Car World Series, Pagenaud in 2008 moved to the [[American Le Mans Series]] co-driving the [[De Ferran Motorsports]] [[Acura ARX-01]]b LMP2 with former CART champion [[Gil de Ferran]]. He finished 14th in the drivers standings.\n\n===2009===\nIn 2009, Pagenaud and de Ferran Motorsports took huge steps forward, with the duo taking second place overall in the American Le Mans Series LMP1 class, only 17 points behind drivers [[David Brabham]] and [[Scott Sharp]] of champions [[Highcroft Racing]]. The duo of Pagenaud and de Ferran drove the ARX-01 to three wins over a total of ten races and three pole positions, turning the fastest lap of the ALMS weekend 6 times.\n\nAlso during 2009, Pagenaud drove in the prestigious [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in LMP1 for the privateer [[Pescarolo Sport]] team in the Peugeot FAP 908. The team did not finish the race, completing 210 laps. The race was won by David Brabham, driving in the factory Peugeot Sport Total No. 9 FAP 908 along with former [[Formula One]] drivers [[Alexander Wurz]] and [[Marc Gen\u00e9]].\n\n===2010===\nFor the 2010 ALMS season, Pagenaud moved over to the Patr\u00f3n Highcroft racing team, replacing Scott Sharp to co-drive with Brabham in the ARX-01c in LMP1 after Sharp vacated the seat to jump to the ALMS GT2 class with his own Ferrari team. Through four rounds in the 2010 ALMS series, the team of Pagenaud and Brabham lead the LMP1 class with three wins and 91 points.\n\nPagenaud also earned a seat driving for the [[Peugeot]] factory team  in 2010 in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans on the renown [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] in the Peugeot FAP 908 No. 3 with [[Pedro Lamy]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]].\n\nWhile the No. 3 Peugeot started from pole, it retired early before nightfall after a mere 38 laps when a suspension mount sheared from the car's tub. The same fate eventually befell the no.1 Peugeot car of [[Anthony Davidson]]/Gene/Wurz while in second place with mere hours left to go in the race, as [[Audi]] reclaimed the 24 Hours of Le Mans title it had retained for five years prior to Peugeot's 2009 win.\n\nDuring the race, Pagenaud found himself competing against his Highcroft Racing team which travelled to Le Mans for the first time in its history. With Brabham driving the Acura in LMP2 alongside [[Marino Franchitti]] and [[Marco Werner]], Highcroft maintained second through most of the race until a cooling issue sidelined the car for much of the race's final four hours.\n\n===2014===\n[[File:GoPro Grand Prix 2015 15 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Pagenaud during practice at the [[2015 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma]]]]\n\nHe won the inaugural [[Grand Prix of Indianapolis]] on 10 May. This was the first time his father watched him race at the venue.\n\n===2015===\nPagenaud moved from [[Schmidt Peterson Motorsports]] to [[Team Penske]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=DiZinno|first=Tony|url=http://motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com/2014/09/29/simon-pagenaud-confirmed-at-team-penske-in-fourth-indycar/|title=Simon Pagenaud confirmed at Team Penske in fourth IndyCar|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=29 September 2014|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> Pagenaud nearly won the [[2015 Indianapolis 500]], leading with less than 30 laps to go and engaging most of the race in a 3-way battle between [[Scott Dixon]] and [[Tony Kanaan]]. Pagenaud ended up being over-taken by the field and went on to finish 10th, while teammate [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won the race. Pagenaud didn't win a race in 2015, but renewed his deal with TEAM Penske in 2016.\n\n=== 2016 ===\nPagenaud got off to the best start of his IndyCar career with five consecutive podiums, including three wins in a row. As the season progressed, Pagenaud and his teammate [[Will Power]] became the primary contenders for the championship. With a strong run at the end of the season, Pagenaud took his first IndyCar Series championship victory, giving Team Penske another championship victory in its 50th year of racing. He finished the season with five race victories and a total of eight podiums.\n\n=== 2017\u2013present ===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\nPagenaud would go winless throughout 2018.\nPagenaud won the Grand Prix of Indianapolis and he would also win the [[2019 Indianapolis 500]] from pole position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/motor/indycar/2019/05/26/2019-indianapolis-500-simon-pagenaud/1245105001/|title=Simon Pagenaud dominates, holds off Alexander Rossi to score first Indianapolis 500 win|last=Ayello|first=Jim|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=May 26, 2019|accessdate=July 20, 2019}}</ref> Pagenaud took the championship lead from [[Team Penske]] team mate [[Josef Newgarden]], however Newgarden would retake the championship lead one race later in Detroit. Pagenaud would take pole and the win at the [[2019 Honda Indy Toronto]] and took pole at the [[2019 Iowa 300]], though the win would go to Newgarden. \nPagenaud is currently 3rd in the points standings, one point behind [[Andretti Autosport]] driver, [[Alexander Rossi]] and 34 points behind points leader Newgarden.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n!

The album includes a new version of her 1966 hit \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\", [[Michael Bolton]]'s \"[[I Found Someone]]\", which Bolton and [[Mark Mangold]] had originally written and composed for, and which had initially been recorded by, [[Laura Branigan]], several songs written by [[Desmond Child]], and two by [[Diane Warren]], who would go on to write many more songs for the singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherscholar.com/recordreview.htm|title=Cher Review|accessdate=2009-02-04|work=CherScholar.com}}</ref>\n\nThe album reached #26 in the UK, and peaked at #32 on the US ''Billboard'' album charts.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cher|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History- Cher|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> The first single released from the album and its only UK top 10 hit was \"[[I Found Someone]]\", which reached #5 in the UK and #10 in the US.<ref name=BillboardSingles/> The second single, \"[[We All Sleep Alone]]\", peaked at #14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 chart and just missed breaking the Adult Contemporary top 10 in the US, stalling at #11.<ref name=BillboardSingles>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cher|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History- Cher (Singles)|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> It was less successful in the UK, however, peaking at #47. The album's other singles were \"[[Skin Deep (Cher song)|Skin Deep]]\", \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)|Bang-Bang]]\", and \"[[Main Man]]\", the last two released only as promo singles in North America.\n\nThis was also her second album to be named \"Cher\", as ''[[Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves|Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves]]'' was initially released under the name ''Cher'' before it was retitled following the success of [[Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves|the single of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gypsys-tramps-thieves-mw0000309635|title=Allmusic: Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves|accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref> She also released a similarly-titled studio album in 1966 entitled ''[[Ch\u00e9r (1966 album)|Ch\u00e9r]]''.\n\n==Promotion==\nThe album was promoted on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where she performed \"I Found Someone\" and \"We All Sleep Alone\", and on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', where she performed \"I Found Someone\" and \"[[I Got You Babe]]\". Later released on [[VHS]], the Letterman performance would be her last with ex-husband [[Sonny Bono]] before his death.

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

The soft ground could not support the heavy central stone tower and steeple, which began to subside and lean. By 1920, the tower leaned {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the south. This defect formed the basis of an important lawsuit (''Wardle v. Bethune'') often cited as precedent relating to Article 1688 of [[Civil Code of Lower Canada|Quebec's Civil Code]].\n\n[[Ross and Macdonald|George Allan Ross]] designed alterations in 1923 and reconstructed the tower from 1939 to 1940.<ref name=\"ross\">{{cite web| title=George Allen Roaa| url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1416| publisher=Biographic Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800-1950| accessdate=2013-03-19| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152701/http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1416| archive-date=2012-04-25| url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1927, the stone steeple, weighing {{convert|1600000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was removed. New foundations were poured in 1939, and in 1940, an anonymous donation permitted the construction of a much lighter steeple made of [[aluminum]], molded to simulate the former stone spire. It is {{convert|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, attaining a height of {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground.<ref name=\"FAQ\" />\n\nRecent additions to the church include a choir gallery, built in 1980, and the church's third [[organ (music)|organ]], installed in 1981. Notable musicians to have served as the church's organist include [[Alfred Whitehead]] (1922\u20131947), [[S. Drummond Wolff]] (1952\u20131956) and [[Patrick Wedd]] ( 1996-2018).\n\nThe organ is opus 77 of Karl Wilhelm, Inc. of [[Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec]].  It is a mechanical key and stop instrument with four-manuals, 42 stops and 63 ranks.  In 1992, the pedal division was expanded with a 32' Bombarde.\n\nThe organ replaced the earlier instrument that served the congregation from 1859.  The earlier instrument was constructed by [[William Hill & Son & Norman & Beard Ltd.|William Hill and Son]] in London to duplicate an organ given to the congregation by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and destroyed in the fire of 1856.  The Hill instrument was remodeled and enlarged several on at least five occasions during the tenure of its service.  In 1979, the congregation commissioned the mechanical organ and the earlier instrument was sold for parts.<ref name=\"wilhelm\">{{cite web| title=Christ Church Anglican Cathedral| url=http://www.uquebec.ca/musique/orgues/quebec/christccm.html#English| publisher=uquebec.ca| accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Promenades Cath\u00e9drale===\n[[File:Christ Church Cathedral night.jpg|thumb|left|Christ Church Cathedral at night.]]\nIn the 1980s, a vast real estate project was undertaken below the cathedral. The project consisted of a 34-floor skyscraper, [[Tour KPMG]], built north of the cathedral, underground parking, and two levels of [[retail stores]] situated beneath the cathedral. For a period in 1987, the cathedral was supported on stilts while footings for the underground mall, [[Promenades Cath\u00e9drale]], were excavated. This project allowed for the linkage of the eastern and western branches of Montreal's [[Underground city, Montreal|underground city]], connecting the [[Eaton's]] store (subsequently [[Complexe Les Ailes]]) and The Bay's [[Henry Morgan Building]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Canadian Grenadier Guards==\nChrist Church Cathedral is the regimental church of the [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]]. The guards maintain their traditional ties with the church, as well as to [[McGill University]], by marching from the Arts Building on campus, to the cathedral, annually in commemoration of [[Remembrance Day]]. The cathedral also houses the guards' retired regimental colours.\n\n==L'Oasis musicale==\nEvery Saturday at 4pm throughout the year the cathedral hosts a series of free weekly concerts, \"L'Oasis musicale,\" which supports and promotes young aspiring musicians, many of whom are studying at music colleges in Montreal and starting out on their career. The concerts are open to all. The concerts feature a range of musicians, from solo instrumentalists and singers to ensembles, small orchestras, and choirs. The repertoire is mainly classical music, but occasionally, popular, folk, religious, or traditional music is played.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[List of cathedrals in Canada]]\n*

The soft ground could not support the heavy central stone tower and steeple, which began to subside and lean. By 1920, the tower leaned {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the south. This defect formed the basis of an important lawsuit (''Wardle v. Bethune'') often cited as precedent relating to Article 1688 of [[Civil Code of Lower Canada|Quebec's Civil Code]].\n\n[[Ross and Macdonald|George Allan Ross]] designed alterations in 1923 and reconstructed the tower from 1939 to 1940.<ref name=\"ross\">{{cite web| title=George Allen Roaa| url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1416| publisher=Biographic Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800-1950| accessdate=2013-03-19| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152701/http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1416| archive-date=2012-04-25| url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1927, the stone steeple, weighing {{convert|1600000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was removed.

It is {{convert|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, attaining a height of {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground.<ref name=\"FAQ\" />\n\nRecent additions to the church include a choir gallery, built in 1980, and the church's third [[organ (music)|organ]], installed in 1981. Notable musicians to have served as the church's organist include [[Alfred Whitehead]] (1922\u20131947) and [[S. Drummond Wolff]] (1952\u20131956).\n\nThe organ is opus 77 of Karl Wilhelm, Inc. of [[Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec]].  It is a mechanical key and stop instrument with four-manuals, 42 stops and 63 ranks.  In 1992, the pedal division was expanded with a 32' Bombarde.\n\nThe organ replaced the earlier instrument that served the congregation from 1859.  The earlier instrument was constructed by [[William Hill & Son & Norman & Beard Ltd.|William Hill and Son]] in London to duplicate an organ given to the congregation by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and destroyed in the fire of 1856.  The Hill instrument was remodeled and enlarged several on at least five occasions during the tenure of its service.  In 1979, the congregation commissioned the mechanical organ and the earlier instrument was sold for parts.<ref name=\"wilhelm\">{{cite web| title=Christ Church Anglican Cathedral| url=http://www.uquebec.ca/musique/orgues/quebec/christccm.html#English| publisher=uquebec.ca| accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Promenades Cath\u00e9drale===\n[[File:Christ Church Cathedral night.jpg|thumb|left|Christ Church Cathedral at night.]]\nIn the 1980s, a vast real estate project was undertaken below the cathedral. The project consisted of a 34-floor skyscraper, [[Tour KPMG]], built north of the cathedral, underground parking, and two levels of [[retail stores]] situated beneath the cathedral. For a period in 1987, the cathedral was supported on stilts while footings for the underground mall, [[Promenades Cath\u00e9drale]], were excavated. This project allowed for the linkage of the eastern and western branches of Montreal's [[Underground city, Montreal|underground city]], connecting the [[Eaton's]] store (subsequently [[Complexe Les Ailes]]) and The Bay's [[Henry Morgan Building]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Canadian Grenadier Guards==\nChrist Church Cathedral is the regimental church of the [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]]. The guards maintain their traditional ties with the church, as well as to [[McGill University]], by marching from the Arts Building on campus, to the cathedral, annually in commemoration of [[Remembrance Day]]. The cathedral also houses the guards' retired regimental colours.\n\n==L'Oasis musicale==\nEvery Saturday at 4.30 pm throughout the year and every Wednesday at 6.30 pm during the summer months the cathedral hosts a series of weekly concerts, \"L'Oasis musicale,\" which supports and promotes local musicians, many of whom are studying at music colleges in Montreal and starting out on their career. The concerts are open to all. The concerts feature a range of musicians, from solo instrumentalists and singers to ensembles, small orchestras, and choirs. The repertoire is mainly classical music, but occasionally, popular, folk, religious, or traditional music is played.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[List of cathedrals in Canada]]\n* [[Dean of Montreal]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{in lang|fr}} Commission des biens culturels, ''Les chemins de la m\u00e9moire, Monuments et sites historiques du Qu\u00e9bec'', Vol. II, Les Publications du Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec, 1991, pp.&nbsp;81\u201383.\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Christ Church Cathedral (Montreal)}}\n* [http://www.montrealcathedral.ca/ Christ Church Cathedral (Montreal) - Official Website]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/ChristChurchCathedralMontreal/ Christ Church Cathedral (Montreal) on Facebook]\n* [https://twitter.com/ChristChurchMtl/ Christ Church Cathedral - (Montreal) on Twitter]\n* [http://montreal.anglican.org/index.lhtml Diocese of Montreal]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080326224350/http://canada.archiseek.com/quebec/montreal/cathedral_anglican.html Archiseek description]\n\n{{Montreal landmarks}}\n{{NHSC}}\n\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1859]]\n[[Category:19th-century Anglican church buildings]]\n[[Category:Anglican cathedrals in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Heritage immovables of Quebec]]\n[[Category:National Historic Sites in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Montreal]]\n[[Category:Churches on the National Historic Sites of Canada register]]\n[[Category:Burned buildings and structures in Canada]]\n[[Category:Rebuilt churches in Canada]]\n[[Category:Downtown Montreal]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "BertrandUK", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_Cathedral_(Montreal)"}

Local health departments determine the appropriate county during their public health investigation.

{"title_page": "Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing", "text_new": "{{computing law}}\nIn [[copyright law]],<!-- [[intellectual property]] law //It is not a general IP issue; it is mainly a copyright issue --> the legal status of '''[[hyperlinking]]''' (also termed \"'''linking'''\") and that of '''[[Framing (World Wide Web)|framing]]''' concern how courts address two different but related Web technologies. In large part, the legal issues concern use of these technologies to create or facilitate public access to proprietary media content &mdash; such as portions of commercial Web sites. When hyperlinking and framing have the effect of distributing, and creating routes for the distribution of content (information) that does not come from the proprietors of the Web pages affected by these practices, the proprietors often seek the aid of courts to suppress the conduct, particularly when the effect of the conduct is to disrupt or circumvent the proprietors' mechanisms for receiving [[Royalties|financial compensation]].\n\nThe issues about linking and framing have become so intertwined under copyright law that it is impractical to attempt to address them separately. As will appear, some decisions confuse them with one another, while other decisions involve and therefore address both. Framing involves the use of hyperlinking, so that any challenge of framing under copyright law is likely to involve a challenge of hyperlinking as well. (The converse is not true.)\n\n==Linking==\nWhile hyperlinking occurs in other technologies, U.S. copyright litigation has centered on HTML. Accordingly, this article considers only such technology.\n\n===Ordinary link===\nThe HTML code for a simple, ordinary hyperlink is shown below.\n\nA home page link would be written this way:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/\">USPTO</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Deep link===\nMost Web sites are organized hierarchically, with a home page at the top and deeper pages within the site, reached by links on the home page. [[Deep linking]] is the practice of using a hyperlink that takes a user directly to a page other than the top or home page. The link given below is a deep link. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents\">General information concerning patents</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA typical Internet browser would render the foregoing HTML code as:\n\n{{block indent|1=<span style=\"text-decoration:underline; color:#36b;\">General information concerning patents</span>}}\n\nWhen a user clicks on the underlined text, the browser jumps from the page on which the link is shown to a page of the Web site of the [[US Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) that has the [[URL]] (Web address) shown above: <nowiki>https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents</nowiki>.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have involved complaints by proprietors of Web pages against the use of deep links.\n\n[[File:Seal of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.svg|thumb|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seal]]\n\n===Inline link===\nRelated issues arise from use of [[Inline linking|inline links]] (also called image-source or img-src links because the HTML code begins with \"img src=\") on Web pages. An inline link places material \u2014 usually an image such as a JPEG or GIF \u2014 from a distant Web site into the Web page being viewed. For example, the adjacent image is the seal of the USPTO, as shown on some of its pages at the USPTO Web site. The URL of one version of the USPTO seal image is https://www.uspto.gov/images/uspto_seal_200.gif, a version of which can be seen in context at https://www.uspto.gov/main/profiles/copyright.htm. The former of these becomes an inline or img-src link if ''img src='' is inserted before the ''http'', angle brackets enclose the whole expression, and the entire code fragment is inserted into the text of a page of HTML code.\n\nWhen an inline (img-src) link of an image is used on a Web page, it seems to be present as a part of the Web page. The presence of the image is only virtual, however, in the sense that the image file is not physically present at the server for the Web site being viewed. The actual location of the image file, if the image were that of the USPTO seal, would be at the USPTO server in Virginia. Use of inline linking has led to contentious litigation (discussed below).\n\n===Hierarchy of links===\n\n[[File:US Supreme Court front view.png|135px|thumb|right|Front view of the U.S. Supreme Court, uploaded to Wikipedia server]]\n\nThe image at right is a front view of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS). It can be found on the SCOTUS Web site as an element in the headings for various pages of that site: https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx<nowiki/>\u2014Biographies of Current Justices of the Supreme Court; https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/about.aspx<nowiki/>\u2014About the Supreme Court; and https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/courtbuilding.aspx<nowiki/>\u2014The Supreme Court Building. The image can also be found in isolation: https://www.supremecourt.gov/images/sectionbanner13.png. All these files are stored on the SCOTUS server and can be accessed by clicking on the respective hyperlinks (deep links). The link to the SCOTUS main page or portal is https://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx.\n\nImage links can be categorized in a hierarchy, based on the technological expedient used to effectuate the link, as explained below. Each further step corresponds to successively lower levels of risk of copyright infringement. The hierarchy operates as follows, using the picture of the SCOTUS building as an example for discussion purposes (selected because it is in the public domain and is not subject to copyright protection; 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;105 provides that copyright protection is not available for any work of the United States Government). An image may be placed on a Web page or made available for viewing by any of the following expedients:\n*Copying the image file to the server hosting the page (as that of the Supreme Court has been copied to the Wikipedia server to present the image at the upper right of this section of text). Unless the image is in the public domain, that copying will create copyright infringement liability unless a defense, such as [[fair use]] or license, applies.<ref>In ''Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google, Inc.'', 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007), the Ninth Circuit held that when Google stored thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's magazine images on its server to communicate them to Google's users, Google prima facie violated Perfect 10's copyright. But the court also held that Google had a valid fair use defense. ''Id''. at 1163-64.</ref> The HTML code for embedding such an image in text is the ordinary form for an image in text (where the PNG file is in same directory as the text): <nowiki><img src=\"Supreme_Court.png\" align=right></nowiki>\n*Using an img-src link to the image at the proprietor's Web page, to make the page ''appear'' to contain the image. [[File:US Supreme Court front view.png|135px|thumb|right|Front view of the U.S. Supreme Court, deep linked to a distant server]]  In an ordinary context, the page's creator would place text around the image, making the image appear as it does at the immediate right. The image from an img-src link looks like the image from a file copied to the page's server, even though the image (i.e., its code) is actually stored on the remote server of the other Web site and not on the page's own server. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered this fact of crucial significance in the ''Perfect 10'' case, discussed subsequently in this article. The court held that, when Google provided links to images, Google did not violate the provisions of the copyright law prohibiting unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copies of a work: \"Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act.\"<ref>508 F.3d at 1160.</ref> (This fact about image storage is also true of all links that follow in this list.)\n\n:This expedient has been challenged as copyright infringement. See the ''Arriba Soft'' and ''Perfect 10'' cases (below). In the ''Perfect 10'' case, Perfect 10 argued that Google's image pages caused viewers to believe they were seeing the images on Google's Web site. The court brushed this argument aside: \"While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google Web page, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.\"<ref>508 F.3d at 1161.</ref>\n\n*Using an ordinary (deep) hyperlink to the image at the remote server, so that users must click on a link on the hosting page to jump to the image.

It is striking that nowhere in [the adversaries'] briefs do they explain why linking could not be constructed in this fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ch6b2.htm |title=Chapter 6B2 - I.P.

[[Framing (World Wide Web)|Framing]] is a method of presentation in a Web page that breaks the screen up into multiple non-overlapping windows. Each window contains a display from a separate HTML file, for example, a Web page from a different Web site that is fetched by [[AutoLink|automatically hyperlinking to it]]. While the usage of frames as a common Web design element has been deprecated for several years (replaced by the usage of [[Span and div|&lt;div&gt;]] elements), some sites, like [[Google Images]] and [[Google Translate]], use frames as a way to help navigate non-Google pages from a framed Google interface.\n\nIncorporating copyrighted Web content by usage of framing has led to contentious litigation. Frames can be used for Web pages belonging to the original site or to load pages from other sites into a customized arrangement of frames that provide a generalized interface without actually requiring the viewer to browse the linked site from that site's URLs and interfaces.\n\nProprietors of copyrighted content have at times contended that framing their Web pages constituted copyright infringement. Copyright provides exclusive rights to reproduce ({{usc|17|106}}(1)) or distribute ({{usc|17|106}}(3)) copies of the work. However, framing does not directly ''reproduce'' or ''distribute'' any copy of the original Web page. Rather, the accused infringer simply establishes a pointer that the user's browser follows to the proprietor's server and Web page. For a pedagogically exaggerated example of the kind of framing that has incensed proprietors of copyrighted content,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Ad'frame.htm |title=Framing the 'Framing' Page |website=Docs.law.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> which \"frames\" a page titled Is Framing Copyright Infringement?, see [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Ad'frame.htm Framing the 'Framing' Page]. On the theory that a picture is worth 1000 words, the viewer is invited to compare the referenced pages to understand what framing is and why it annoys proprietors of framed pages.\n\n==History of copyright litigation in field==\nIn large part, linking and framing are not held to be [[copyright infringement]] under U.S. and German copyright law, even though the underlying Web pages are protected under copyright law. Because the copyright-protected content is stored on a server other than that of the linking or framing person (it is stored on the plaintiff's server), there is typically no infringing \"copy\" made by the defendant linking or framing person (as may be essential) on which to base liability. Some European countries take a more protective view, however, and hold unauthorized framing and so-called deep linking unlawful.\n\n===European Union===\n\nThe [[European Court of Justice]]'s binding ruling in 2014 was that embedding a work could not be a violation of copyright:\n{{quote|1=The embedding in a website of a protected work which is publicly accessible on another website by means of a link using the framing technology \u2026 does not by itself constitute communication to the public within the meaning of [the EU Copyright directive] to the extent that the relevant work is neither communicated to a new public nor by using a specific technical means different from that used for the original communication.|2=[https://edri.org/cjeu-embedding-copyright-infringement/ EDRI translation] of original [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=159023&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=382141 Courth ruling (C-348/13) of the BestWater International GmbH vs. Michael Mebes and Stefan Potsch] (ECLI:EU:C:2014:2315)|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn September 2016, the European Court of Justice ruled that knowingly linking to an unauthorized posting of a copyrighted work for commercial gain constituted infringement of the exclusive right to communicate the work to the public. The case surrounded [[GeenStijl]] and [[Sanoma]]; in 2011, photos were leaked from an upcoming issue of the Dutch version of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' (published by Sanoma) and hosted on a Web site known as FileFactory. GeenStijl covered the leak by displaying a thumbnail of one of the images and linking to the remainder of the unauthorized copies. The court ruled in favor of Sanoma, arguing that GeenStijl's authors knowingly reproduced and communicated a copyrighted work to the public without consent of its author, and that GeenStijl had profited from the unauthorized publication.<ref name=\"verge-eulinkingcopyright\">{{cite web|title=Europe's Court of Justice rules that hyperlinking can infringe on copyright|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12877872/eu-court-of-justice-hyperlinking-infringe-copyright.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12877872/eu-court-of-justice-hyperlinking-infringe-copyright|website=The Verge|date=11 September 2016|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n\n====''Belgian Association of Newspaper Editors'' v.

Newsbooster's service allows users to enter keywords to search for news stories, and then deep links to the stories are provided. The DNPA said that this conduct was \"tantamount to theft.\" The court ruled in favor of the DNPA, not because of the mere act of linking but because Newsbooster used the links to gain commercial advantage over the DNPA, which was unlawful under the [[Danish Marketing Act]]. The court enjoined Newsbooster's service.<ref name=\"wired-deeplink\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/07/53697?currentPage=all|title=Deep Link Foes Get Another Win|journal=Wired|author=Michelle Delio|date=8 July 2002|accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n====''home A/S'' v. ''Ofir A-S''====\nThe Maritime and Commercial Court in Copenhagen took a somewhat different view in 2005 in a suit that home A/S, a real estate chain, brought against Ofir A-S, an Internet portal (OFiR), which maintains an Internet search engine. home A/S maintains an Internet Web site that has a searchable database of its current realty listings. Ofir copied some database information, which the court held unprotected under Danish law, and also Ofir's search engine provided deep links to the advertisements for individual properties that home A/S listed, thus by-passing the home page and search engine of home A/S. The court held that the deep linking did not create infringement liability. The Court found that search engines are desirable as well as necessary to the function of the Internet; that it is usual that search engines provide deep links; and that businesses that offer their services on the Internet must expect that deep links will be provided to their Web sites. Ofir's site did not use banner advertising and its search engine allowed users, if they so chose, to go to a home page rather than directly to the advertisement of an individual property. The opinion does not appear to distinguish or explain away the difference in result from that of the ''Newsbooster'' case.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author1 = Sylvia Mercado-Kierkegaard\n | journal = [[Computer Law and Security Report]]\n |  volume = 22\n | issue = 4\n |date=April 2006\n | pages = 326\u2013332\n | doi = 10.1016/j.clsr.2006.05.007\n | title = Clearing the legal barriers \u2013 Danish court upholds 'deep linking' in Home v.

Tickets.com, Inc.]]'' (2000), yielded a ruling in favour of deep linking.\n\n====''Kelly'' v. ''Arriba Soft''====\nThe first important U.S. decision in this field was that of the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation|Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.]]''<ref>336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003).</ref> Kelly complained, among other things, that Arriba's search engine used thumbnails to deep link to images on his Web page. The court found that Arriba's use was highly transformative,<ref>See article on [[Transformativeness]].</ref> in that it made available to Internet users a functionality not previously available, and that was not otherwise readily provided \u2014 an improved way to search for images (by using visual cues instead of verbal cues). This factor, combined with the relatively slight economic harm to Kelly, tipped the [[fair use]] balance decisively in Arriba's favour.\n\nAs in other cases, Kelly objected to linking because it caused users to bypass his home page and intervening pages. He was unable, however, to show substantial economic harm. Kelly argued largely that the part of the copyright statute violated was the public display right ({{usc|17|106}}(5)).<ref>Kelly's position, as crystallized at the final stages of the appeal, was that an unauthorized public display occurred (or the conduct was not fair use) because Arriba was changing the ''context'' of Kelly's art works. Kelly had wanted to present them in a particular format and setting, but Arriba altered that by deep linking (linking well beyond Kelly's home page) directly to the images and presenting them in a different manner than the one that Kelly had chosen for them. (Arriba both in-line linked and deep linked.) The position that ''changing context = copyright infringement'' was perhaps best articulated in the brief of Kelly's amicus, the American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.</ref> He was aware of the difficulties under the reproduction and distribution provisions (17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106(1) and (3)), which require proof that the accused infringer trafficked in copies of the protected work. The court focused on the fair use defense, however, under which it ruled in Arriba's favour.\n\n====''Perfect 10'' v. ''Amazon''====\nIn ''[[Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.]]'',<ref>487 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2007).</ref> the Ninth Circuit again considered whether an image search engine's use of thumbnail was a [[fair use]]. Although the facts were somewhat closer than in the ''Arriba Soft'' case, the court nonetheless found the accused infringer's use fair because it was \"highly transformative.\" The court explained:\n\n<blockquote>\nWe conclude that the significantly transformative nature of Google's search engine, particularly in light of its public benefit, outweighs Google's superseding and commercial uses of the thumbnails in this case. \u2026 We are also mindful of the Supreme Court's direction that \"the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the court specifically addressed the copyright status of linking, in the first U.S. appellate decision to do so:\n\n<blockquote>\nGoogle does not \u2026 display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other words, Google does not have any \"material objects \u2026 in which a work is fixed \u2026 and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated\" and thus cannot communicate a copy. Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user's browser to a Web site publisher's computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives the address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user's computer screen. Google may facilitate the user's access to infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner's display rights. \u2026 While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google Web page, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.\n</blockquote>\n\n====State of U.S. law after ''Arriba Soft'' and ''Perfect 10''====\nThe ''Arriba Soft'' case stood for the proposition that deep linking and actual reproduction in reduced-size copies (or preparation of reduced-size derivative works) were both excusable as fair use because the defendant's use of the work did not actually or potentially divert trade in the marketplace from the first work; and also it provided the public with a previously unavailable, very useful function of the kind that copyright law exists to promote (finding desired information on the Web). The ''Perfect 10'' case involved similar considerations, but more of a balancing of interests was involved. The conduct was excused because the value to the public of the otherwise unavailable, useful function outweighed the impact on Perfect 10 of Google's possibly superseding use.\n\nMoreover, in ''Perfect 10'', the court laid down a far-reaching precedent in favour of linking and framing, which the court gave a complete pass under copyright. It concluded that \"in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google Web page, [but] the Copyright Act . . . does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.\"\n\nA February 2018 summary judgement from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|District Court for the Southern District of New York]] created a new challenge to the established cases. In ''Goldman v. Breitbart'', Justin Goldman, a photographer, posted his on-the-street photograph of [[Tom Brady]] with [[Boston Celtics]] GM [[Danny Ainge]] and others to [[Snapchat]], which became popular over social media such as [[Twitter]] on rumors that Brady was helping with the Celtics' recruitment. Several news organizations subsequently published stories embedding the tweets with Goldman's photograph in the stories. Goldman took legal action against nine of these news agencies, claiming they violated his copyright. Judge Katherine Forrest decided in favour of Goldman and asserting the news sites violated his copyright, rejecting elements of the ''Perfect 10'' ruling. Forrest said that as the news agencies had to take specific steps to embed the tweets with the photograph in their stories, wrote the stories to highlight those, and otherwise was not providing an automated service like Google's search engine.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-rules-news-publishers-violated-copyright-by-embedding-tweets-tom-brady-photo-1085342 | title = Judge Rules News Publishers Violated Copyright by Embedding Tweets of Tom Brady Photo | first = Eriq | last = Gardner | date = February 16, 2018 | accessdate = February 16, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Computer law]]\n[[Category:Copyright law]]\n[[Category:Hypertext]]\n", "text_old": "{{computing law}}\nIn [[copyright law]],<!-- [[intellectual property]] law //It is not a general IP issue; it is mainly a copyright issue --> the legal status of '''[[hyperlinking]]''' (also termed \"'''linking'''\") and that of '''[[Framing (World Wide Web)|framing]]''' concern how courts address two different but related Web technologies. In large part, the legal issues concern use of these technologies to create or facilitate public access to proprietary media content &mdash; such as portions of commercial Web sites. When hyperlinking and framing have the effect of distributing, and creating routes for the distribution of content (information) that does not come from the proprietors of the Web pages affected by these practices, the proprietors often seek the aid of courts to suppress the conduct, particularly when the effect of the conduct is to disrupt or circumvent the proprietors' mechanisms for receiving [[Royalties|financial compensation]].\n\nThe issues about linking and framing have become so intertwined under copyright law that it is impractical to attempt to address them separately. As will appear, some decisions confuse them with one another, while other decisions involve and therefore address both. Framing involves the use of hyperlinking, so that any challenge of framing under copyright law is likely to involve a challenge of hyperlinking as well. (The converse is not true.)\n\n==Linking==\nWhile hyperlinking occurs in other technologies, U.S. copyright litigation has centered on HTML. Accordingly, this article considers only such technology.\n\n===Ordinary link===\nThe HTML code for a simple, ordinary hyperlink is shown below.\n\nA home page link would be written this way:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/\">USPTO</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Deep link===\nMost Web sites are organized hierarchically, with a home page at the top and deeper pages within the site, reached by links on the home page. [[Deep linking]] is the practice of using a hyperlink that takes a user directly to a page other than the top or home page. The link given below is a deep link. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents\">General information concerning patents</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA typical Internet browser would render the foregoing HTML code as:\n\n{{block indent|1=<span style=\"text-decoration:underline; color:#36b;\">General information concerning patents</span>}}\n\nWhen a user clicks on the underlined text, the browser jumps from the page on which the link is shown to a page of the Web site of the [[US Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) that has the [[URL]] (Web address) shown above: https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have involved complaints by proprietors of Web pages against the use of deep links.\n\n[[File:Seal of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.svg|thumb|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seal]]\n\n===Inline link===\nRelated issues arise from use of [[Inline linking|inline links]] (also called image-source or img-src links because the HTML code begins with \"img src=\") on Web pages. An inline link places material \u2014 usually an image such as a JPEG or GIF \u2014 from a distant Web site into the Web page being viewed. For example, the adjacent image is the seal of the USPTO, as shown on some of its pages at the USPTO Web site. The URL of one version of the USPTO seal image is https://www.uspto.gov/images/uspto_seal_200.gif, a version of which can be seen in context at https://www.uspto.gov/main/profiles/copyright.htm. The former of these becomes an inline or img-src link if ''img src='' is inserted before the ''http'', angle brackets enclose the whole expression, and the entire code fragment is inserted into the text of a page of HTML code.\n\nWhen an inline (img-src) link of an image is used on a Web page, it seems to be present as a part of the Web page. The presence of the image is only virtual, however, in the sense that the image file is not physically present at the server for the Web site being viewed. The actual location of the image file, if the image were that of the USPTO seal, would be at the USPTO server in Virginia. Use of inline linking has led to contentious litigation (discussed below).\n\n===Hierarchy of links===\n\n[[File:US Supreme Court front view.png|135px|thumb|right|Front view of the U.S. Supreme Court, uploaded to Wikipedia server]]\n\nThe image at right is a front view of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS). It can be found on the SCOTUS Web site as an element in the headings for various pages of that site: https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx<nowiki/>\u2014Biographies of Current Justices of the Supreme Court; https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/about.aspx<nowiki/>\u2014About the Supreme Court; and https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/courtbuilding.aspx<nowiki/>\u2014The Supreme Court Building. The image can also be found in isolation: https://www.supremecourt.gov/images/sectionbanner13.png. All these files are stored on the SCOTUS server and can be accessed by clicking on the respective hyperlinks (deep links). The link to the SCOTUS main page or portal is https://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx.\n\nImage links can be categorized in a hierarchy, based on the technological expedient used to effectuate the link, as explained below. Each further step corresponds to successively lower levels of risk of copyright infringement. The hierarchy operates as follows, using the picture of the SCOTUS building as an example for discussion purposes (selected because it is in the public domain and is not subject to copyright protection; 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;105 provides that copyright protection is not available for any work of the United States Government). An image may be placed on a Web page or made available for viewing by any of the following expedients:\n*Copying the image file to the server hosting the page (as that of the Supreme Court has been copied to the Wikipedia server to present the image at the upper right of this section of text). Unless the image is in the public domain, that copying will create copyright infringement liability unless a defense, such as [[fair use]] or license, applies.<ref>In ''Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google, Inc.'', 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007), the Ninth Circuit held that when Google stored thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's magazine images on its server to communicate them to Google's users, Google prima facie violated Perfect 10's copyright. But the court also held that Google had a valid fair use defense. ''Id''. at 1163-64.</ref> The HTML code for embedding such an image in text is the ordinary form for an image in text (where the PNG file is in same directory as the text): <nowiki><img src=\"Supreme_Court.png\" align=right></nowiki>\n*Using an img-src link to the image at the proprietor's Web page, to make the page ''appear'' to contain the image. [[File:US Supreme Court front view.png|135px|thumb|right|Front view of the U.S. Supreme Court, deep linked to a distant server]]  In an ordinary context, the page's creator would place text around the image, making the image appear as it does at the immediate right. The image from an img-src link looks like the image from a file copied to the page's server, even though the image (i.e., its code) is actually stored on the remote server of the other Web site and not on the page's own server. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered this fact of crucial significance in the ''Perfect 10'' case, discussed subsequently in this article. The court held that, when Google provided links to images, Google did not violate the provisions of the copyright law prohibiting unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copies of a work: \"Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act.\"<ref>508 F.3d at 1160.</ref> (This fact about image storage is also true of all links that follow in this list.)\n\n:This expedient has been challenged as copyright infringement. See the ''Arriba Soft'' and ''Perfect 10'' cases (below). In the ''Perfect 10'' case, Perfect 10 argued that Google's image pages caused viewers to believe they were seeing the images on Google's Web site. The court brushed this argument aside: \"While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google Web page, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.\"<ref>508 F.3d at 1161.</ref>\n\n*Using an ordinary (deep) hyperlink to the image at the remote server, so that users must click on a link on the hosting page to jump to the image. The HTML code would be <nowiki>https://www.supremecourt.gov/images/sectionbanner13.png</nowiki>. This has been protested because it bypasses everything at the other site but the image. Such protests have been largely ineffective.<ref>Kelly unsuccessfully argued this point in ''Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.'', 336 F.3d 811, 816 (9th Cir. 2003).</ref> This argument on Kelly's behalf is articulated in the ''amicus curiae'' brief supporting Kelly by the American Society of Media Photographers:<blockquote>[I]t was the actual display of the full-size images of Kelly\u2019s work stripped from the original context that was not fair use. Merely linking to Kelly's originating home page, on the other hand, without free-standing display of the full-size images, would not run afoul of the fair use limits established by the Panel. It is striking that nowhere in [the adversaries'] briefs do they explain why linking could not be constructed in this fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ch6b2.htm |title=Chapter 6B2 - I.P.

The HTML code is <nowiki>https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx</nowiki> for ''Biographies of Current Justices of the Supreme Court''. This has been protested because it does not require the viewer to look at the advertising or other material at the home and other earlier pages on the proprietor's site, although the user must look at what is on the same page as the image. Such protests have been largely ineffective.\n*Linking to the home page of the image proprietor's Web site and explaining how to page down through his successive pages and all of his extraneous material to find the image. For example: <nowiki>https://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx</nowiki>. This will not create copyright infringement liability under any theory thus far advanced in U.S. litigation.<ref>A more detailed description of the alternatives with implementing HTML code snippets is available at ''Is Linking Copyright Infringement?''.</ref>\n\n===Framing===\nFraming is the juxtaposition of two separate Web pages within the same page, usually with a separate frame with navigational elements. [[Framing (World Wide Web)|Framing]] is a method of presentation in a Web page that breaks the screen up into multiple non-overlapping windows. Each window contains a display from a separate HTML file, for example, a Web page from a different Web site that is fetched by [[AutoLink|automatically hyperlinking to it]]. While the usage of frames as a common Web design element has been deprecated for several years (replaced by the usage of [[Span and div|&lt;div&gt;]] elements), some sites, like [[Google Images]] and [[Google Translate]], use frames as a way to help navigate non-Google pages from a framed Google interface.\n\nIncorporating copyrighted Web content by usage of framing has led to contentious litigation. Frames can be used for Web pages belonging to the original site or to load pages from other sites into a customized arrangement of frames that provide a generalized interface without actually requiring the viewer to browse the linked site from that site's URLs and interfaces.\n\nProprietors of copyrighted content have at times contended that framing their Web pages constituted copyright infringement. Copyright provides exclusive rights to reproduce ({{usc|17|106}}(1)) or distribute ({{usc|17|106}}(3)) copies of the work. However, framing does not directly ''reproduce'' or ''distribute'' any copy of the original Web page. Rather, the accused infringer simply establishes a pointer that the user's browser follows to the proprietor's server and Web page. For a pedagogically exaggerated example of the kind of framing that has incensed proprietors of copyrighted content,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Ad'frame.htm |title=Framing the 'Framing' Page |website=Docs.law.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> which \"frames\" a page titled Is Framing Copyright Infringement?, see [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Ad'frame.htm Framing the 'Framing' Page]. On the theory that a picture is worth 1000 words, the viewer is invited to compare the referenced pages to understand what framing is and why it annoys proprietors of framed pages.\n\n==History of copyright litigation in field==\nIn large part, linking and framing are not held to be [[copyright infringement]] under U.S. and German copyright law, even though the underlying Web pages are protected under copyright law. Because the copyright-protected content is stored on a server other than that of the linking or framing person (it is stored on the plaintiff's server), there is typically no infringing \"copy\" made by the defendant linking or framing person (as may be essential) on which to base liability. Some European countries take a more protective view, however, and hold unauthorized framing and so-called deep linking unlawful.\n\n===European Union===\n\nThe [[European Court of Justice]]'s binding ruling in 2014 was that embedding a work could not be a violation of copyright:\n{{quote|1=The embedding in a website of a protected work which is publicly accessible on another website by means of a link using the framing technology \u2026 does not by itself constitute communication to the public within the meaning of [the EU Copyright directive] to the extent that the relevant work is neither communicated to a new public nor by using a specific technical means different from that used for the original communication.|2=[https://edri.org/cjeu-embedding-copyright-infringement/ EDRI translation] of original [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=159023&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=382141 Courth ruling (C-348/13) of the BestWater International GmbH vs. Michael Mebes and Stefan Potsch] (ECLI:EU:C:2014:2315)|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn September 2016, the European Court of Justice ruled that knowingly linking to an unauthorized posting of a copyrighted work for commercial gain constituted infringement of the exclusive right to communicate the work to the public. The case surrounded [[GeenStijl]] and [[Sanoma]]; in 2011, photos were leaked from an upcoming issue of the Dutch version of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' (published by Sanoma) and hosted on a Web site known as FileFactory. GeenStijl covered the leak by displaying a thumbnail of one of the images and linking to the remainder of the unauthorized copies. The court ruled in favor of Sanoma, arguing that GeenStijl's authors knowingly reproduced and communicated a copyrighted work to the public without consent of its author, and that GeenStijl had profited from the unauthorized publication.<ref name=\"verge-eulinkingcopyright\">{{cite web|title=Europe's Court of Justice rules that hyperlinking can infringe on copyright|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12877872/eu-court-of-justice-hyperlinking-infringe-copyright.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12877872/eu-court-of-justice-hyperlinking-infringe-copyright|website=The Verge|date=11 September 2016|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n\n====''Belgian Association of Newspaper Editors'' v.

''Newsbooster''====\nThe Bailiff's Court of Copenhagen ruled in July 2002 against the Danish Web site Newsbooster, holding, in a suit brought by the Danish Newspaper Publishers Association (DNPA), that Newsbooster had violated Danish copyright law by deep linking to newspaper articles on Danish newspapers' Internet sites.  Newsbooster's service allows users to enter keywords to search for news stories, and then deep links to the stories are provided. The DNPA said that this conduct was \"tantamount to theft.\" The court ruled in favor of the DNPA, not because of the mere act of linking but because Newsbooster used the links to gain commercial advantage over the DNPA, which was unlawful under the [[Danish Marketing Act]]. The court enjoined Newsbooster's service.<ref name=\"wired-deeplink\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/07/53697?currentPage=all|title=Deep Link Foes Get Another Win|journal=Wired|author=Michelle Delio|date=8 July 2002|accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n====''home A/S'' v. ''Ofir A-S''====\nThe Maritime and Commercial Court in Copenhagen took a somewhat different view in 2005 in a suit that home A/S, a real estate chain, brought against Ofir A-S, an Internet portal (OFiR), which maintains an Internet search engine. home A/S maintains an Internet Web site that has a searchable database of its current realty listings. Ofir copied some database information, which the court held unprotected under Danish law, and also Ofir's search engine provided deep links to the advertisements for individual properties that home A/S listed, thus by-passing the home page and search engine of home A/S. The court held that the deep linking did not create infringement liability. The Court found that search engines are desirable as well as necessary to the function of the Internet; that it is usual that search engines provide deep links; and that businesses that offer their services on the Internet must expect that deep links will be provided to their Web sites. Ofir's site did not use banner advertising and its search engine allowed users, if they so chose, to go to a home page rather than directly to the advertisement of an individual property. The opinion does not appear to distinguish or explain away the difference in result from that of the ''Newsbooster'' case.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author1 = Sylvia Mercado-Kierkegaard\n | journal = [[Computer Law and Security Report]]\n |  volume = 22\n | issue = 4\n |date=April 2006\n | pages = 326\u2013332\n | doi = 10.1016/j.clsr.2006.05.007\n | title = Clearing the legal barriers \u2013 Danish court upholds 'deep linking' in Home v.

Tickets.com, Inc.]]'' (2000), yielded a ruling in favour of deep linking.\n\n====''Kelly'' v. ''Arriba Soft''====\nThe first important U.S. decision in this field was that of the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation|Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.]]''<ref>336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003).</ref> Kelly complained, among other things, that Arriba's search engine used thumbnails to deep link to images on his Web page. The court found that Arriba's use was highly transformative,<ref>See article on [[Transformativeness]].</ref> in that it made available to Internet users a functionality not previously available, and that was not otherwise readily provided \u2014 an improved way to search for images (by using visual cues instead of verbal cues). This factor, combined with the relatively slight economic harm to Kelly, tipped the [[fair use]] balance decisively in Arriba's favour.\n\nAs in other cases, Kelly objected to linking because it caused users to bypass his home page and intervening pages. He was unable, however, to show substantial economic harm. Kelly argued largely that the part of the copyright statute violated was the public display right ({{usc|17|106}}(5)).<ref>Kelly's position, as crystallized at the final stages of the appeal, was that an unauthorized public display occurred (or the conduct was not fair use) because Arriba was changing the ''context'' of Kelly's art works. Kelly had wanted to present them in a particular format and setting, but Arriba altered that by deep linking (linking well beyond Kelly's home page) directly to the images and presenting them in a different manner than the one that Kelly had chosen for them. (Arriba both in-line linked and deep linked.) The position that ''changing context = copyright infringement'' was perhaps best articulated in the brief of Kelly's amicus, the American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.</ref> He was aware of the difficulties under the reproduction and distribution provisions (17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106(1) and (3)), which require proof that the accused infringer trafficked in copies of the protected work. The court focused on the fair use defense, however, under which it ruled in Arriba's favour.\n\n====''Perfect 10'' v. ''Amazon''====\nIn ''[[Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.]]'',<ref>487 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2007).</ref> the Ninth Circuit again considered whether an image search engine's use of thumbnail was a [[fair use]]. Although the facts were somewhat closer than in the ''Arriba Soft'' case, the court nonetheless found the accused infringer's use fair because it was \"highly transformative.\" The court explained:\n\n<blockquote>\nWe conclude that the significantly transformative nature of Google's search engine, particularly in light of its public benefit, outweighs Google's superseding and commercial uses of the thumbnails in this case. \u2026 We are also mindful of the Supreme Court's direction that \"the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the court specifically addressed the copyright status of linking, in the first U.S. appellate decision to do so:\n\n<blockquote>\nGoogle does not \u2026 display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other words, Google does not have any \"material objects \u2026 in which a work is fixed \u2026 and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated\" and thus cannot communicate a copy. Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user's browser to a Web site publisher's computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives the address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user's computer screen. Google may facilitate the user's access to infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner's display rights. \u2026 While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google Web page, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.\n</blockquote>\n\n====State of U.S. law after ''Arriba Soft'' and ''Perfect 10''====\nThe ''Arriba Soft'' case stood for the proposition that deep linking and actual reproduction in reduced-size copies (or preparation of reduced-size derivative works) were both excusable as fair use because the defendant's use of the work did not actually or potentially divert trade in the marketplace from the first work; and also it provided the public with a previously unavailable, very useful function of the kind that copyright law exists to promote (finding desired information on the Web). The ''Perfect 10'' case involved similar considerations, but more of a balancing of interests was involved. The conduct was excused because the value to the public of the otherwise unavailable, useful function outweighed the impact on Perfect 10 of Google's possibly superseding use.\n\nMoreover, in ''Perfect 10'', the court laid down a far-reaching precedent in favour of linking and framing, which the court gave a complete pass under copyright. It concluded that \"in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google Web page, [but] the Copyright Act . . . does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.\"\n\nA February 2018 summary judgement from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|District Court for the Southern District of New York]] created a new challenge to the established cases. In ''Goldman v. Breitbart'', Justin Goldman, a photographer, posted his on-the-street photograph of [[Tom Brady]] with [[Boston Celtics]] GM [[Danny Ainge]] and others to [[Snapchat]], which became popular over social media such as [[Twitter]] on rumors that Brady was helping with the Celtics' recruitment. Several news organizations subsequently published stories embedding the tweets with Goldman's photograph in the stories. Goldman took legal action against nine of these news agencies, claiming they violated his copyright. Judge Katherine Forrest decided in favour of Goldman and asserting the news sites violated his copyright, rejecting elements of the ''Perfect 10'' ruling. Forrest said that as the news agencies had to take specific steps to embed the tweets with the photograph in their stories, wrote the stories to highlight those, and otherwise was not providing an automated service like Google's search engine.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-rules-news-publishers-violated-copyright-by-embedding-tweets-tom-brady-photo-1085342 | title = Judge Rules News Publishers Violated Copyright by Embedding Tweets of Tom Brady Photo | first = Eriq | last = Gardner | date = February 16, 2018 | accessdate = February 16, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Computer law]]\n[[Category:Copyright law]]\n[[Category:Hypertext]]\n", "name_user": "BOT MusicRooM", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_aspects_of_hyperlinking_and_framing"}
