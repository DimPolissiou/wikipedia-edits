The population was 323 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is part of the [[Rexburg, Idaho]] [[Rexburg micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cabin near Newdale repaired.jpg|thumb|left|Log cabin and homestead in the Newdale area. Early 1900s.]]\nIn the early 1900s, there were only a few homes and farms scattered across the vast terrain east of [[Teton, Idaho|Teton City]]. Early settlers in this area include family names such as Siddoway, Briggs, and Schwendiman. The Schwendiman family, consisting of 6 brothers and their mother, a widow, relocated from [[Paris, Idaho|Paris Idaho]] to [[Teton, Idaho|Teton Idaho]] in 1894. As the Schwendiman brothers grew older and married, they began to homestead and dry farm in the area east of Newdale, and obtained land in 160 acre parcels via the [[Homestead Acts]]. Part of this land includes where the City of Newdale now sits. Many families in this area would live on their farms, working from spring to fall, but would move to Teton or other nearby towns during the winter months.\n\nIn 1912, a one-room rock school house was built in Bowerman, an area 2 miles east of present-day Newdale, to accommodate approximately 15 school children living in the surrounding area. The school house was also used for LDS Church meetings. Bowerman may have developed into a village, if had not been for the railroad being built in the Newdale area, which encouraged growth.\n\n[[File:Newdale Train Depot Poor Quality Image.jpg|thumb|left|Newdale Train Depot]]\nThe [[Oregon Short Line Railroad]] wanted to expand into this part of the country and on June 27, 1914, purchased a right of way from brothers Sam and Fred Schwendiman to lay tracks for a new branch line. The new railroad attracted people to Newdale and in 1914 the Edwin Moroni Stocks family built a house and the Leo Schofield family built a cabin. Mrs. Hansine C. Hansen, a widow, was also one of the first people to move in, and had her sons move her house from Teton, perhaps early in 1915. Burt Garner was also one of the first to build a home and move in, and he also started a grocery store.\n\nSam and Fred Schwendiman incorporated the Newdale Investment Company for commercial purposes, which erected a rock building that housed, on the ground floor, a hardware supply and drug store. The other part of the building was leased to the First National Bank of Newdale, an independent bank managed by G.C. Alden. Upstairs, a fine recreation hall was completed for dancing, with a stage where operettas and drama productions could be given. The facility formally opened in June 1915 and attracted considerable attention at the time. A train depot was also built in 1915, and catered to both freight and passenger service. Later that summer, in August, a group of men representing the Chamber of Commerce came to Newdale by train and were entertained at this community center before making the loop back to Idaho Falls.\n\nThe US Post Office established a Newdale Post Office and on February 15, 1916, appointed Sam Schwendiman as the first post master.\n\n[[File:Newdale ID Water Tower.jpg|thumb|right|Newdale ID Water Tower]]\nOn March 17, 1916, the water system was completed, including a wooden elevated water storage tank and underground wooded water mains. The project cost $15,000 (some records say $18,000).\n\nThe Newdale Investment Company made land available for the townsite of Newdale, which was surveyed and plotted by engineers Cotton and Wilson in April 1916. In May, several hundred shade trees, apple trees, and other fruit trees were planted throughout the town.\n\nThe LDS Newdale Ward was organized on December 17, 1916, with Lester Hanson as the first bishop. School and church meetings were held in a vacant building on Main Street.\n\nIn 1916, a contract was negotiated with the Utah Power and Light Company, to bring electricity to Newdale. Telephone service came shortly after. The Idaho Falls Daily Post published a notice with headlines that read: \"Newdale bright lights beckon to the world. All over the Upper Snake Valley the question has been asked, 'What are these many electric lights we see twinkling up on the bench every night?'\".\n\n[[File:Newdale 1913or1914 Enhanced.jpg|thumb|left| Main Street in Newdale Idaho, facing south. Photo taken approximately 1913 or 1914.]]\nThe Village of Newdale was incorporated in January 1917. The first town board was: Joseph Fleischman as chairman, Frank Williams as clerk, Burt L. Garner as treasurer, and Edwin Stocks, George Bean, Henry Campeau as board members. In the fall of 1915 an incorporated Company, known as the Farmer's Warehouse Company, built a large warehouse in Newdale, which became the shipping point for crops raised in the surrounding area. Sugar beets were the main crop of the area, followed by grains, alfalfa, and seed peas. Potatoes would become the main crop after 1920.\n\nIn 1918, the Spanish Influenza hit, and the whole town masked their faces when going out in public. School was let out for the year because of the flu.\n\n[[File:Newdale Operahouse Enchanced.jpg|thumb|left| Newdale Opera House on Main St. Newdale Idaho]]The year 1918 produced one of the best crops that has even been produced in this area. Newdale grew rapidly and by 1919, after being only four years old, it had a national bank, a mercantile and drug store, a barber shop, a blacksmith, a carpenter shop, a printing shop, a real estate office, a livery stable, several general stores, lumber yards, hardware stores, implement yards, warehouses, grain elevators, commission houses, hotels, restaurants,  and an opera house. It is estimated that Newdale doubled in size in 1919. The value of city lots had raised several times.\n\n[[File:Billiards Newdale ID Token.png|thumb|right|A token from a billiards pool hall that existed in Newdale ID in 1916.]]\nAccording to railroad shipping records, Newdale was once the 3rd largest grain shipping center in the nation. Shipments between August 1, 1918 and May 31, 1919 totaled 403 train car loads of wheat, 19 barely, 3 oats, 17 peas, 72 beets, 3 potatoes, 3 hay, 68 livestock, and 3 misc produce. A railroad depot was built, and passengers trains would also stop at Newdale. The railroad used to continue north past Newdale and would go to St. Anthony and Ashton(citation needed).\n\n[[File:Newdale School 1919 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|School House Newdale ID 1919]]\nThe people of Newdale were very progressive and hard workers and had a desire to make the area a truly good place to live. In December 1919, an 8-room, brick school house was completed on a piece of land donated by Sam Schwendiman, where the Newdale City Park is today. Leigh Chantrill was a young boy at the time, and later said: \"It was really exciting when the new school house was completed enough so we could use it for school and church meetings\". Its classrooms were heated by wood stove, and had no indoor plumbing. A playground was also built including swings and a baseball diamond. Students would attend school in Newdale from 1st to 8th grade, and then go to school in Teton for freshman and sophomore years, and Sugar City for high school. The Newdale school house was also used for LDS church meetings until a church house was built in 1952.\n\nAn agriculture depression in the early 1920s hurt the town, and many families lost their homes and farms to creditors, and were forced to leave Newdale. In 1924, when John Schwendiman was asked to be bishop of the Newdale LDS ward, he said this about the state of the town: \u201cNewdale was half deserted. Some houses had burned down. Others were moved away and several were empty. The town was bonded for over $100,000 for the school house and water works.\u201d The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s had similar negative effects. The beat dump closed down but the potato industry would continue to expand. By 1944, only $1000 had been paid off in principal on the cities debts.  The 1940s brought a new generation of farmers, with a lot of thought and effort being put towards irrigation. They used wells and dams. Sprinkler irrigation would double or triple the amount of usable farm land in the area.\n\nAn LDS church house was completed and dedicated in 1952.\n\nIn 1967, the City of Newdale purchased the Newdale School house and property, which was no longer in use, and turned it into a city park over the next few years. It was also at this time that the streets of Newdale were officially named (from West to East): R.R. Street (Railroad), Main Street, Church Street, Park Street, and Schwendiman Park Road.\n\nA swimming pool was built in Newdale with a new well to supply the water. The pool failed shortly after opening, due to lack of patronage. Newdale wells produce warm water.\n\nNewdale is the nearest city to the [[Teton Dam]], which failed on June 5, 1976. Newdale did not receive any flooding or damage, due to its elevation and position relative to the dam.\n\n===Memories===\n\"I remember riding in the old Nash truck to deliver grain to the Farmer's Warehouse where Walter's potato business is now located.

Gerald Clark, who was Lee Clark's brother, got involved in the plot and was shot and killed just south of the Newdale store, by Fox and McCarrel. It was a sad time for the people of Newdale, because Mr. Gerald Clark had a family. After a long trial in the St. Anthony Court House, Mr. McCarrel and Mr. Fox were sent to the State Penitentiary.

The population was 323 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is part of the [[Rexburg, Idaho]] [[Rexburg micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cabin near Newdale repaired.jpg|thumb|left|Log cabin and homestead in the Newdale area. Early 1900s.]]\nIn the early 1900s, there were only a few homes and farms scattered across the vast terrain east of [[Teton, Idaho|Teton City]]. Early settlers in this area include family names such as Siddoway, Briggs, and Schwendiman. The Schwendiman family, consisting of 6 brothers and their mother, a widow, relocated from [[Paris, Idaho|Paris Idaho]] to [[Teton, Idaho|Teton Idaho]] in 1894. As the Schwendiman brothers grew older and married, they began to homestead and dry farm in the area east of Newdale, and obtained land in 160 acre parcels via the [[Homestead Acts]]. Part of this land includes where the City of Newdale now sits. Many families in this area would live on their farms, working from spring to fall, but would move to Teton or other nearby towns during the winter months.\n\nIn 1912, a one-room rock school house was built in Bowerman, an area 2 miles east of present-day Newdale, to accommodate approximately 15 school children living in the surrounding area. The school house was also used for LDS Church meetings. Bowerman may have developed into a village, if had not been for the railroad being built in the Newdale area, which encouraged growth.\n\n[[File:Newdale Train Depot Poor Quality Image.jpg|thumb|left|Newdale Train Depot]]\nThe [[Oregon Short Line Railroad]] wanted to expand into this part of the country and on June 27, 1914, purchased a right of way from brothers Sam and Fred Schwendiman to lay tracks for a new branch line. The new railroad attracted people to Newdale and in 1914 the Edwin Moroni Stocks family built a house and the Leo Schofield family built a cabin. Mrs. Hansine C. Hansen, a widow, was also one of the first people to move in, and had her sons move her house from Teton, perhaps early in 1915. Burt Garner was also one of the first to build a home and move in, and he also started a grocery store.\n\nSam and Fred Schwendiman incorporated the Newdale Investment Company for commercial purposes, which erected a rock building that housed, on the ground floor, a hardware supply and drug store. The other part of the building was leased to the First National Bank of Newdale, an independent bank managed by G.C. Alden. Upstairs, a fine recreation hall was completed for dancing, with a stage where operettas and drama productions could be given. The facility formally opened in June 1915 and attracted considerable attention at the time. A train depot was also built in 1915, and catered to both freight and passenger service. Later that summer, in August, a group of men representing the Chamber of Commerce came to Newdale by train and were entertained at this community center before making the loop back to Idaho Falls.\n\nThe US Post Office established a Newdale Post Office and on February 15, 1916, appointed Sam Schwendiman as the first post master.\n\n[[File:Newdale ID Water Tower.jpg|thumb|right|Newdale ID Water Tower]]\nOn March 17, 1916, the water system was completed, including a wooden elevated water storage tank and underground wooded water mains. The project cost $15,000 (some records say $18,000).\n\nThe Newdale Investment Company made land available for the townsite of Newdale, which was surveyed and plotted by engineers Cotton and Wilson in April 1916. In May, several hundred shade trees, apple trees, and other fruit trees were planted throughout the town.\n\nThe LDS Newdale Ward was organized on December 17, 1916, with Lester Hanson as the first bishop. School and church meetings were held in a vacant building on Main Street.\n\nIn 1916, a contract was negotiated with the Utah Power and Light Company, to bring electricity to Newdale. Telephone service came shortly after. The Idaho Falls Daily Post published a notice with headlines that read: \"Newdale bright lights beckon to the world. All over the Upper Snake Valley the question has been asked, 'What are these many electric lights we see twinkling up on the bench every night?'\".\n\n[[File:Newdale 1913or1914 Enhanced.jpg|thumb|left| Main Street in Newdale Idaho, facing south. Photo taken approximately 1913 or 1914.]]\nThe Village of Newdale was incorporated in January 1917. The first town board was: Joseph Fleischman as chairman, Frank Williams as clerk, Burt L. Garner as treasurer, and Edwin Stocks, George Bean, Henry Campeau as board members. In the fall of 1915 an incorporated Company, known as the Farmer\u2019s Warehouse Company, built a large warehouse in Newdale, which became the shipping point for crops raised in the surrounding area. Sugar beets were the main crop of the area, followed by grains, alfalfa, and seed peas. Potatoes would become the main crop after 1920.\n\nIn 1918, the Spanish Influenza hit, and the whole town masked their faces when going out in public. School was let out for the year because of the flu.\n\n[[File:Newdale Operahouse Enchanced.jpg|thumb|left| Newdale Opera House on Main St. Newdale Idaho]]The year 1918 produced one of the best crops that has even been produced in this area. Newdale grew rapidly and by 1919, after being only four years old, it had a national bank, a mercantile and drug store, a barber shop, a blacksmith, a carpenter shop, a printing shop, a real estate office, a livery stable, several general stores, lumber yards, hardware stores, implement yards, warehouses, grain elevators, commission houses, hotels, restaurants,  and an opera house. It is estimated that Newdale doubled in size in 1919. The value of city lots had raised several times.\n\n[[File:Billiards Newdale ID Token.png|thumb|right|A token from a billiards pool hall that existed in Newdale ID in 1916.]]\nAccording to railroad shipping records, Newdale was once the 3rd largest grain shipping center in the nation. Shipments between August 1, 1918 and May 31, 1919 totaled 403 train car loads of wheat, 19 barely, 3 oats, 17 peas, 72 beets, 3 potatoes, 3 hay, 68 livestock, and 3 misc produce. A railroad depot was built, and passengers trains would also stop at Newdale. The railroad used to continue north past Newdale and would go to St. Anthony and Ashton(citation needed).\n\n[[File:Newdale School 1919 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|School House Newdale ID 1919]]\nThe people of Newdale were very progressive and hard workers and had a desire to make the area a truly good place to live. In December 1919, an 8-room, brick school house was completed on a piece of land donated by Sam Schwendiman, where the Newdale City Park is today. Leigh Chantrill was a young boy at the time, and later said: \"It was really exciting when the new school house was completed enough so we could use it for school and church meetings\". Its classrooms were heated by wood stove, and had no indoor plumbing. A playground was also built including swings and a baseball diamond. Students would attend school in Newdale from 1st to 8th grade, and then go to school in Teton for freshman and sophomore years, and Sugar City for high school. The Newdale school house was also used for LDS church meetings until a church house was built in 1952.\n\nAn agriculture depression in the early 1920s hurt the town, and many families lost their homes and farms to creditors, and were forced to leave Newdale. In 1924, when John Schwendiman was asked to be bishop of the Newdale LDS ward, he said this about the state of the town: \u201cNewdale was half deserted. Some houses had burned down. Others were moved away and several were empty. The town was bonded for over $100,000 for the school house and water works.\u201d The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s had similar negative effects. The beat dump closed down but the potato industry would continue to expand. By 1944, only $1000 had been paid off in principal on the cities debts.  The 1940s brought a new generation of farmers, with a lot of thought and effort being put towards irrigation. They used wells and dams. Sprinkler irrigation would double or triple the amount of usable farm land in the area.\n\nAn LDS church house was completed and dedicated in 1952.\n\nIn 1967, the City of Newdale purchased the Newdale School house and property, which was no longer in use, and turned it into a city park over the next few years. It was also at this time that the streets of Newdale were officially named (from West to East): R.R. Street (Railroad), Main Street, Church Street, Park Street, and Schwendiman Park Road.\n\nA swimming pool was built in Newdale with a new well to supply the water. The pool failed shortly after opening, due to lack of patronage. Newdale wells produce warm water.\n\nNewdale is the nearest city to the [[Teton Dam]], which failed on June 5, 1976. Newdale did not receive any flooding or damage, due to its elevation and position relative to the dam.\n\n===Memories===\n\"I remember riding in the old Nash truck to deliver grain to the Farmer's Warehouse where Walter's potato business is now located.

Leigh Chantrill, story took place approximately 1918 - 1922.\n\n\"In the prohibition days when it was illegal to sell liquors in any form, the following took place in Newdale: Two young men from Newdale, Lee Clark and Delray Huff, went to work for the government as informants, or stool pigeons as they were called. They would buy liquor from the bootleggers, then they would report the bootleggers to the government law enforcement officers. Lee Clark and Delray Huff worked for the government and turned in a Mr. McCarrel and his fellow bootlegger a Mr. Fox. Fox and McCarrel came up to Newdale one night to shoot Lee Clark and Delray Huff. Gerald Clark, who was Lee Clark's brother, got involved in the plot and was shot and killed just south of the Newdale store, by Fox and McCarrel.

Pyle would go on to write other stories concerning King Arthur and his knights, including ''[[The Story of the Champions of the Round Table]]'', ''[[The Story of Sir Launcelot and His Companions]]'', and ''[[The Story of the Grail and the Passing of King Arthur]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{More plot|date=June 2018}}\n===''The Book of King Arthur''===\n====The Winning of Kinghood====\nThe book begins by telling how young Arthur pulled a sword out of an anvil, how he learned of his royal lineage, and how he thus became king.\n\n====The Winning of a Sword====\nKing Arthur loses to his enemy, [[Pellinore|King Pellinore]], and suffers many wounds. [[Merlin]] advises Arthur to seek [[Excalibur]]. The [[Lady of the Lake]] instructs Arthur on how to earn the sword, and, following her instructions, he takes Excalibur. He then meets Pellinore again, and with Excalibur's magic, he wins against him. The two thereafter make amends and become friends.\n\n====The Winning of a Queen====\nKing Arthur is captivated by the [[Lady Guinevere]], the daughter of his friend, [[King Leodegrance]], and in an attempt to win her love visits [[Cameliard]], the castle where Lady Guinevere resides. With Merlin's help, he disguises himself as a peasant and works as a gardener below her tower. Meanwhile, [[Rience|King Ryence]] threatens Leodegrance for much of his lands, and also for the notorious Duke of North Umber being able to marry Guinevere. The Duke torments the people of Cameliard by parading in front of the castle, calling for someone to challenge him at arms. Arthur, though unrecognized by others, accepts the challenge and defeats the Duke. He then goes traveling through the country and runs into [[Sir Geraint]], [[Gawain|Sir Gawaine]], [[Ywain|Sir Ewaine]], and [[Pelleas|Sir Pellias]]. He defeats them all in battle and demands them to be servants unto the Lady Guinevere. Shortly after, he returns to Cameliard, donning his peasant costume once more. He is just in time for another challenge by the Duke, and Arthur chooses to take on the challenge. Unrecognized, he forces the knights to obey to him. After he finds his armor, Arthur asks to be Guinevere's [[Courtly love|champion]]. She then gives him her necklace. He and his knights defeat the Duke and his companions. After the battle, Arthur reveals himself to [[King Leodegrance]], and asks for the hand of his daughter.\n\n===''The Book of Three Worthies''===\n\n====The Story of Merlin====\nMerlin is bewitched by an aspiring, young sorceress named Vivien, a friend of [[Morgan le Fay|Queen Morgana le Fay]]. Morgana seeks revenge against Arthur because he did not choose her son, [[Sir Tor]], to be a member of the Round Table. Merlin, being infatuated with Vivien, teaches her all of the sorcery he knows. Vivien then gives Merlin a sleeping potion forcing him into a deep sleep which gives her the opportunity to cast a spell on him so he can no longer move. Merlin, shortly before his death, prophesizes that Arthur is in trouble, and his dying wish is that Vivien would save Arthur. Vivien proceeds to have Merlin buried alive but promises to aid King Arthur. Meanwhile, King Arthur and [[Accolon|Sir Accalon]], meanwhile, become lost while hunting. While searching for their way out, they see a ship coming to shore. The ship is run by [[fairies]], and they offer Arthur and Accalon a feast and comfortable quarters for the night. Arthur awakes a prisoner in the dungeon of Sir Domas le Noir, which is full of miserable knights and even some ladies. The only way to escape is to fight a battle against Sir Domas's brother, Sir Ontzlake. Arthur agrees. Meanwhile, Accalon awakes in a beautiful, strange land with a fair maiden. She asks him to fight for Sir Ontzlake against Sir Domas and offers Excalibur as a reward if he accepts. Accalon agrees. This turns out to be a plan by Morgana to end Arthur's life. Arthur and Accalon, not recognizing each other, fight a very bloody and harsh battle. They both end up near their deaths; Vivien soon leads them to a nunnery. Through sorcery and concoctions, she leads Arthur to good health once again, though he must rest for a while. When Arthur asks Vivien to treat Accalon, she lies and says she has no more of her concoction. Accalon passes away from his wounds. Morgana steals the sheath of Excalibur while Arthur rests, and she drops the sheath back into the lake whence he obtained it. Once Arthur awakes he is outraged, and he, Vivien, and his men go searching for her. Morgana transforms herself into a rock, yet Vivien recognizes her and begs Arthur to kill her. Arthur, however, forgives his sister. Vivien is mad at Arthur for this and remains vengeful.\n\n====The Story of Sir Pellias====\nWhile the Queen and her court, including Sir Pellias, went out maying, a damsel named Parcenet approaches them. She explains that she came to see if the Queen was more beautiful than her Lady Ettard, who is reputed in her area to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Sir Pellias agrees to go to Grantmesnle, the home of Lady Ettard, to settle the matter with her knight, Sir Engamore of Malverat. As Parcenet and Sir Pellias journey to Grantmesnle, they venture into the legendary Forest of Adventure, a place rumored to always bring some kind of adventure to a knight. There they found a sad old woman who sat by a stream of water. She asks for help in crossing the stream, as it is very violent and she is feeble. Sir Pellias kindly helps the old woman onto his horse and then passes the stream. As Sir Pellias helps the old woman down from the horse, she transform into the Lady of the Lake. The Lady gave him a beautiful, magical necklace which makes the wearer adored by all who see him. Later he gives the necklace to Lady Ettard. Under the spell of the necklace, Sir Pellias becomes deeply infatuated with Lady Ettard. However, once Sir Pellias took off the necklace, Lady Ettard felt no love for him whatsoever. Sir Pellias humiliates himself trying to see the Lady Ettard who abandoned his affections. Sir Gawaine, meanwhile, is told by the Lady of the Lake to go to Grantmesnle to help bring sense into Sir Pellias. Sir Pellias accepts his help, and they devise a plan, but Sir Gawaine is, too, charmed by Lady Ettard. Sir Pellias and Sir Gawaine have a fight, where Pellias, although victorious, is wounded by Gawaine. Pellias, nearly dying, is brought to the chapel of a healing hermit. The Lady of the Lake comes. First, she takes the necklace with the charms. She then revives Pellias with a potion. Although Pellias is revived, he is no longer fully mortal, but instead half-mortal and half-fairy. The Lady of the Lake and Sir Pellias go to their fairy city hidden on the lake, where they are married.\n\n====The Story of Sir Gawaine====\nDuring a procession of King Arthur and his Court, they saw a beautiful dog pursuing a likewise beautiful deer. Immediately after, they saw a knight and a lady attacked by another knight who, having struck the knight of the lady, took her captive. Upon King Arthur\u2019s request, Sir Gawaine and his brother went off to discover the meaning of these events. Gawaine and his brother eventually arrived at a castle where they saw the dog had been slain by arrows. In a rage, Gawaine pursued the deer into the castle courtyard and killed it perceiving that the dog died because it pursued the deer. The lady of the castle became greatly distressed over her slain deer, so the lord, Sir Ablamor, challenged Gawaine to a fight. Gawaine bested Ablamor but didn\u2019t kill him. Because Gawaine showed him mercy, Ablamor invited him to dine in his castle and explained the meaning behind the strange events. Sometime earlier, Ablamor\u2019s brother\u2019s wife had gone out riding with Ablamor\u2019s wife when they came across a woman, she turned out to be the sorceress Vivien, who gave them the dog and deer. Ever since then, the two brothers had been at odds because the dog continually pursued the deer. During the day of the Court\u2019s procession, Lord Ablamor saw his wife\u2019s deer being chased by his brother\u2019s wife dog and became greatly angered. When he also saw his brother and his brother\u2019s wife riding not far behind, Ablamor concluded that the pursuit of the deer was on purpose and struck his brother and took his wife captive. Gawaine returned to King Arthur\u2019s court and related these events to him. Shortly after these events, King Arthur went off seeking adventure. After becoming lost in a forest, he and his esquire reached a castle where they sought shelter. There they met an old knight who challenged King Arthur to a test of courage. The challenge was to see who could survive after getting their head cut off. To the surprise of Arthur, who struck first, the old knight lived. The old knight said he would spare King Arthur\u2019s life if after a year and a day Arthur returned and answered a riddle. After the year had passed and King Arthur sought in vain for an answer to the riddle, he set out to fulfill his promise. On the way, he met an old woman who promised to tell him the answer to the riddle on the condition that she would get to marry a knight of his court. The old woman also told him that the old knight was kept alive by an enchanted necklace. King Arthur agreed to the old woman\u2019s condition and defeated the old knight. In keeping his promise, King Arthur brought the old woman to his court and allowed her to choose a knight to marry. She chose Sir Gawaine which is upsetting to him. After they marry, she tested Gawaine and when he proved to be a worthy knight, she revealed herself as a Lady of the Lake.\n\n==Reception==\nInstead of just retelling the stories previously told by [[Sidney Lanier]] and [[Sir Thomas Malory]], Pyle came up with new versions of the stories, using other stories and his own imagination to embellish the tales.<ref name=\"Lupack-82\">Lupack, p.82</ref> Pyle's telling of the Arthurian stories \"[used] text and illustrations to complement one another...in the presentation of natural description.\"<ref name=\"Lupack-83\">Lupack, p.83</ref> Helmut Nickel, in his essay \"Arms and Armor in Arthurian Films\", called Pyle's illustrations \"glorious\", and worthy of use for inspiration for any Arthurian film.<ref name=\"Nickel-236\">Nickel, p.236</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Lupack|first1=Alan|last2=Lupack|first2=Barbara Tepa|title=King Arthur in America|date=May 1999|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=Harty|editor1-first=Kevin J.|last1=Nickel|first1=Helmut|title=Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays|chapter=Arms and Armor in Arthurian Films|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource|1=The Story of King Arthur and his Knights|2=The Story of King Arthur and his Knights}}\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/storyofkingarthu00pylerich ''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights''] at the [[Internet Archive]]\n*[https://archive.org/details/king_arthur_and_his_knights_1704_librivox Audio book version] by [[LibriVox]] at the Internet Archive\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Story of King Arthur and His Knights}}\n[[Category:1903 American novels]]\n[[Category:1903 children's books]]\n[[Category:1903 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Modern Arthurian fiction]]\n[[Category:Arthurian literature in English]]\n[[Category:Children's historical novels]]\n[[Category:Historical fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table series]]\n[[Category:Novels by Howard Pyle]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = The Story of King Arthur and His Knights\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = The Story of King Arthur and His Knights by Howard Pyle - 1903 cover.png\n| caption       = Cover of the first printing of the 1903 edition\n| author        = [[Howard Pyle]]\n| cover_artist  = \n| series        = \n| genre         = [[Children's literature]], [[historical fiction]]\n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| publisher     = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]\n| published     = November 1903\n| media_type    = \n| pages         = 416\n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   = [[The Story of the Champions of the Round Table]]\n}}\n'''''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights''''' is a 1903 [[novel]] by the American illustrator and writer [[Howard Pyle]].

Once Arthur awakes he is outraged, and he, Vivien, and his men go searching for her. Morgana transforms herself into a rock, yet Vivien recognizes her and begs Arthur to kill her. Arthur, however, forgives his sister. Vivien is mad at Arthur for this and remains vengeful.\n\n====The Story of Sir Pellias====\nWhile the Queen and her court, including Sir Pellias, went out maying, a damsel named Parcenet approaches them. She explains that she came to see if the Queen was more beautiful than her Lady Ettard, who is reputed in her area to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Sir Pellias agrees to go to Grantmesnle, the home of Lady Ettard, to settle the matter with her knight, Sir Engamore of Malverat. As Parcenet and Sir Pellias journey to Grantmesnle, they venture into the legendary Forest of Adventure, a place rumored to always bring some kind of adventure to a knight. There they found a sad old woman who sat by a stream of water. She asks for help in crossing the stream, as it is very violent and she is feeble. Sir Pellias kindly helps the old woman onto his horse and then passes the stream. As Sir Pellias helps the old woman down from the horse, she transform into the Lady of the Lake. The Lady gave him a beautiful, magical necklace which makes the wearer adored by all who see him. Later he gives the necklace to Lady Ettard. Under the spell of the necklace, Sir Pellias becomes deeply infatuated with Lady Ettard. However, once Sir Pellias took off the necklace, Lady Ettard felt no love for him whatsoever. Sir Pellias humiliates himself trying to see the Lady Ettard who abandoned his affections. Sir Gawaine, meanwhile, is told by the Lady of the Lake to go to Grantmesnle to help bring sense into Sir Pellias. Sir Pellias accepts his help, and they devise a plan, but Sir Gawaine is, too, charmed by Lady Ettard. Sir Pellias and Sir Gawaine have a fight, where Pellias, although victorious, is wounded by Gawaine. Pellias, nearly dying, is brought to the chapel of a healing hermit. The Lady of the Lake comes. First, she takes the necklace with the charms. She then revives Pellias with a potion. Although Pellias is revived, he is no longer fully mortal, but instead half-mortal and half-fairy. The Lady of the Lake and Sir Pellias go to their fairy city hidden on the lake, where they are married.\n\n====The Story of Sir Gawaine====\nDuring a procession of King Arthur and his Court, they saw a beautiful dog pursuing a likewise beautiful deer. Immediately after, they saw a knight and a lady attacked by another knight who, having struck the knight of the lady, took her captive. Upon King Arthur\u2019s request, Sir Gawaine and his brother went off to discover the meaning of these events. Gawaine and his brother eventually arrived at a castle where they saw the dog had been slain by arrows. In a rage, Gawaine pursued the deer into the castle courtyard and killed it perceiving that the dog died because it pursued the deer. The lady of the castle became greatly distressed over her slain deer, so the lord, Sir Ablamor, challenged Gawaine to a fight. Gawaine bested Ablamor but didn\u2019t kill him. Because Gawaine showed him mercy, Ablamor invited him to dine in his castle and explained the meaning behind the strange events. Sometime earlier, Ablamor\u2019s brother\u2019s wife had gone out riding with Ablamor\u2019s wife when they came across a woman, she turned out to be the sorceress Vivien, who gave them the dog and deer. Ever since then, the two brothers had been at odds because the dog continually pursued the deer.  During the day of the Court\u2019s procession, Lord Ablamor saw his wife\u2019s deer being chased by his brother\u2019s wife dog and became greatly angered. When he also saw his brother and his brother\u2019s wife riding not far behind, Ablamor concluded that the pursuit of the deer was on purpose and struck his brother and took his wife captive. Gawaine returned to King Arthur\u2019s court and related these events to him. Shortly after these events, King Arthur went off seeking adventure. After becoming lost in a forest, he and his esquire reached a castle where they sought shelter. There they met an old knight who challenged King Arthur to a test of courage. The challenge was to see who could survive after getting their head cut off. To the surprise of Arthur, who struck first, the old knight lived. The old knight said he would spare King Arthur\u2019s life if after a year and a day Arthur returned and answered a riddle. After the year had passed and King Arthur sought in vain for an answer to the riddle, he set out to fulfill his promise. On the way, he met an old woman who promised to tell him the answer to the riddle on the condition that she would get to marry a knight of his court. The old woman also told him that the old knight was kept alive by an enchanted necklace. King Arthur agreed to the old woman\u2019s condition and defeated the old knight.  In keeping his promise, King Arthur brought the old woman to his court and allowed her to choose a knight to marry. She chose Sir Gawaine which is upsetting to him. After they marry, she tested Gawaine and when he proved to be a worthy knight, she revealed herself as a Lady of the Lake.\n\n==Reception==\nInstead of just retelling the stories previously told by [[Sidney Lanier]] and [[Sir Thomas Malory]], Pyle came up with new versions of the stories, using other stories and his own imagination to embellish the tales.<ref name=\"Lupack-82\">Lupack, p.82</ref> Pyle's telling of the Arthurian stories \"[used] text and illustrations to complement one another...in the presentation of natural description.\"<ref name=\"Lupack-83\">Lupack, p.83</ref> Helmut Nickel, in his essay \"Arms and Armor in Arthurian Films\", called Pyle's illustrations \"glorious\", and worthy of use for inspiration for any Arthurian film.<ref name=\"Nickel-236\">Nickel, p.236</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Lupack|first1=Alan|last2=Lupack|first2=Barbara Tepa|title=King Arthur in America|date=May 1999|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=Harty|editor1-first=Kevin J.|last1=Nickel|first1=Helmut|title=Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays|chapter=Arms and Armor in Arthurian Films|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource|1=The Story of King Arthur and his Knights|2=The Story of King Arthur and his Knights}}\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/storyofkingarthu00pylerich ''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights''] at the [[Internet Archive]]\n*[https://archive.org/details/king_arthur_and_his_knights_1704_librivox Audio book version] by [[LibriVox]] at the Internet Archive\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Story of King Arthur and His Knights}}\n[[Category:1903 American novels]]\n[[Category:1903 children's books]]\n[[Category:1903 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:Modern Arthurian fiction]]\n[[Category:Arthurian literature in English]]\n[[Category:Children's historical novels]]\n[[Category:Historical fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table series]]\n[[Category:Novels by Howard Pyle]]\n", "name_user": "NicoScribe", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_King_Arthur_and_His_Knights"}
