Her father was a customs officer from [[Fribourg]], her mother Jeanne was a dance instructor. Ir\u00e8ne's family was very open-minded and allowed the adolescent who wanted to become a fashion illustrator to enroll at Basel's art school in 1925. There, Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden attended drawing classes with [[Albrecht Mayer]] (1875\u20131952), studied color theory under Arnold Fiechter (1879\u20131943) and graphic arts under  [[Fritz Baumann (Maler)|Fritz Baumann]] (1886\u20131942). Until she got her degree in 1929, she produced mainly portrait drawings.\n\nThat year, Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden made her first trip to Paris, where she continued her education for a few months at the  [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]]. In 1932, she spent a couple of months in the French capital with  [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim|Meret Oppenheim]], a friend since around 1927/28. In the years following her graduating, Ms. Zurkinden began painting more scenic cityscapes in a style clearly influenced by [[Impressionism]]. During this time, she lived alternately in Paris and Basel, where she earned herself a reputation as a popular portrait artist. From 1932 to 1972, the artist had an annual exhibition in the Gallery of Marguerite Schulthess in Basel's Aeschenvorstadt. After Marguerite Schulthess's death, Ms. Zurkinden became a fixture of Basel's Gallery Riehentor, whose owner Trudl Bruckner was a founding member of ART Basel. In 1980, the Beyeler Gallery in Basel's B\u00e4umleingasse presented the artist in a solo exhibition.\n\nIn 1934, Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden met jazz musician Kurt Fenster, the son of a Brazilian circus artist and a German mother. During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] dictatorship, Fenster emigrated to Paris. The couple lived for several years in the French capital. At the outbreak of  [[World War II|World War 2]], Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden returned to Switzerland. Her sons Nicolas (Kolka) (*1937) and Stephan (*1943) from her relationship with Kurt Fenster grew up with their mother in Basel.\n\nFrom 1942,  Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden participated in the exhibitions of [[Gruppe 33|Group 33]]. During the second half of the 1930s and the early 1940s, she produced works inspired by surrealism. In 1985, the Kunstmuseum Basel honored her with a comprehensive retrospective of her work.\n\nAfter [[World War II|World War 2]], Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden lived in Basel and Paris and made long trips to  [[Morocco]] (1948), [[Spain]] (1950/51) and [[Italy]] (1952/53). In those years, she designed costumes and sets for the [[Theater Basel|Stadttheater Basel]] and increasingly worked on book illustrations.\n\n== Awards and commemoration ==\n\n* In 1978 she was awarded the [https://www.sperber-kollegium.ch/ehrespalebaerglemer/1976-1978/ \"Ehrespaleb\u00e4rglemer\"] by the Sperber-Kollegium Basel.\n* In 1986 she was awarded the [[Kulturpreis der Stadt Basel|Basel Cultural Award]].\n* The city of Basel honored the artist in 2014 by naming a tree-lined public square \"Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden Square\".

After Marguerite Schulthess's death, Ms. Zurkinden became a fixture of Basel's Gallery Riehentor, whose owner Trudl Bruckner was a founding member of ART Basel. In 1980, the Beyeler Gallery in Basel's B\u00e4umleingasse presented the artist in a solo exhibition.\n\nIn 1934, Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden met jazz musician Kurt Fenster, the son of a Brazilian circus artist and a German mother. During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] dictatorship, Fenster emigrated to Paris. The couple lived for several years in the French capital. At the outbreak of  [[World War II|World War 2]], Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden returned to Switzerland. Her sons Nicolas (Kolka) (*1937) and Stephan (*1943) from her relationship with Kurt Fenster grew up with their mother in Basel.\n[[File:Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden (1932).jpg|thumb|Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden: Self-portrait.

During the second half of the 1930s and the early 1940s, she produced works inspired by surrealism. In 1985, the Kunstmuseum Basel honored her with a comprehensive retrospective of her work.\n\nAfter [[World War II|World War 2]], Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden lived in Basel and Paris and made long trips to  [[Morocco]] (1948), [[Spain]] (1950/51) and [[Italy]] (1952/53). In those years, she designed costumes and sets for the [[Theater Basel|Stadttheater Basel]] and increasingly worked on book illustrations.\n\n== Awards and commemoration ==\n[[File:Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden (1909\u20131987) .jpg|thumb|Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden's gravestone]]\n\n* In 1978 she was awarded the [https://www.sperber-kollegium.ch/ehrespalebaerglemer/1976-1978/ \"Ehrespaleb\u00e4rglemer\"] by the Sperber-Kollegium Basel.\n* In 1986 she was awarded the [[Kulturpreis der Stadt Basel|Basel Cultural Award]].\n* The city of Basel honored the artist in 2014 by naming a tree-lined public square \"Ir\u00e8ne Zurkinden Square\".

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://stgilescathedral.org.uk/the-national-covenant-of-scotland/|title=The National Covenant of Scotland|website=stgilescathedral.org.uk|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Thistle Chapel==\n[[File:Thistle Chapel Interior.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel showing the ceiling and knights' stalls]]\n{{see|Thistle Chapel}}\n\nLocated at the south-east corner of St Giles', the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]]; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://stgilescathedral.org.uk/the-national-covenant-of-scotland/|title=The National Covenant of Scotland|website=stgilescathedral.org.uk|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Thistle Chapel==\n[[File:Thistle Chapel Interior.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel showing the ceiling and knights' stalls]]\n{{see|Thistle Chapel}}\n\nLocated at the south-east corner of St Giles', the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]]; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

Named after a fictional railway company in ''Europa'',<ref name=\"tomb\" /> their most recent film at the time, Zentropa has produced many movies other than Trier's own, as well as several television series. It has also produced hardcore sex films: ''Constance'' (1998), ''Pink Prison'' (1999), ''HotMen CoolBoyz'' (2000), and ''All About Anna'' (2005). To make money for his newly founded company, von{{nbsp}}Trier made ''[[The Kingdom (miniseries)|The Kingdom]]'' (Danish title ''Riget'', 1994) and ''[[The Kingdom (miniseries)|The Kingdom{{nbsp}}II]]'' (''Riget{{nbsp}}II'', 1997), a pair of miniseries recorded in the Danish national hospital, the name \"Riget\" being a colloquial name for the hospital known as Rigshospitalet (lit. The Kingdom's Hospital) in Danish. A projected third season of the series was derailed by the death in 1998 of [[Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd]], who played Dr. Helmer, and that of [[Kirsten Rolffes]], who played Mrs. Drusse, in 2000, two of the major characters.\n\n=== Inventing the Dogme 95 manifesto ===\n[[File:Dogme28.jpg|thumb|''[[Dogme 95]]'' Certificate for Susanne Bier's film ''[[Open Hearts]]'']] In 1995 von Trier and [[Thomas Vinterberg]] presented their manifesto for a new cinematic movement, which they called [[Dogme 95]].

A documentary chronicling the project was directed by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0418697/ Jesper Jargil], and was released in 2000 with the title ''[[De Udstillede]]'' (The Exhibited).\n\n=== The ''Golden Heart'' trilogy ===\nVon Trier achieved his greatest international success with his ''Golden Heart'' trilogy. Each film in the trilogy is about naive heroines who maintain their \"golden hearts\" despite the tragedies they experience. This trilogy consists of: ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), and ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000).<ref>[http://www.andsoitbeginsfilms.com/2013/06/top-10-unconventional-trilogies.html Unconventional Trilogies], dated June 2013, at andsoitbeginsfilms.com</ref> While all three films are sometimes associated with the [[Dogme 95]] movement, only ''[[The Idiots]]'' is a certified Dogme{{nbsp}}95 film.\n\n==== ''Breaking the Waves'' ====\n''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), the first film in his ''Golden Heart'' trilogy, won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and featured [[Emily Watson]], who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Its grainy images, and hand-held photography, pointed towards Dogme{{nbsp}}95 but violated several of the manifesto's rules, and therefore does not qualify as a Dogme{{nbsp}}95 film.\n\n====''The Idiots''====\nThe second film in the trilogy, ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), was nominated for a [[Palme d'Or]], with which he was presented in person at the Cannes Film Festival despite his dislike of traveling.\n\n==== ''Dancer in the Dark'' ====\nIn 2000 von Trier premiered a musical featuring Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]], ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]''.

''Dogville'' and ''Manderlay'' were both shot with the same distinctive, extremely stylized approach, placing the actors on a bare [[sound stage]] with no set decoration and the buildings' walls marked by chalk lines on the floor, a style inspired by 1970s televised theatre. ''[[Dogville]]'' (2003) starred [[Nicole Kidman]] and ''[[Manderlay]]'' (2005) starred [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in the same main role as Grace Margaret Mulligan. Both films have casts of major international actors, including [[Harriet Andersson]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[James Caan]], [[Danny Glover]], and [[Willem Dafoe]], and question various issues relating to American society, such as intolerance (in ''Dogville'') and slavery (in ''Manderlay'').\n\n===''The Boss of It All'' and ''The Early Years''===\nIn 2006 von Trier released a Danish-language comedy film, ''[[The Boss of It All]]''. It was shot using an experimental process that he has called [[Automavision]], which involves the director choosing the best possible fixed camera position and then allowing a computer to randomly choose when to tilt, pan, or zoom.\n\nFollowing ''[[The_Boss_of_It_All|The Boss of It All]]'', von Trier scripted an autobiographical film, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1|da|3=De unge \u00e5r: Erik Nietzsche sagaen del 1}}'' in 2007, which went on to be directed by [[Jacob Thuesen]]. The film tells the story of von{{nbsp}}Trier's years as a student at the National Film School of Denmark.

It is based on a screenplay by [[Carl Th. Dreyer]] and stars [[Udo Kier]].

Named after a fictional railway company in ''Europa'',<ref name=\"tomb\" /> their most recent film at the time, Zentropa has produced many movies other than Trier's own, as well as several television series. It has also produced hardcore sex films: ''Constance'' (1998), ''Pink Prison'' (1999), ''HotMen CoolBoyz'' (2000), and ''All About Anna'' (2005). To make money for his newly founded company, von{{nbsp}}Trier made ''[[The Kingdom (miniseries)|The Kingdom]]'' (Danish title ''Riget'', 1994) and ''[[The Kingdom (miniseries)|The Kingdom{{nbsp}}II]]'' (''Riget{{nbsp}}II'', 1997), a pair of miniseries recorded in the Danish national hospital, the name \"Riget\" being a colloquial name for the hospital known as Rigshospitalet (lit. The Kingdom's Hospital) in Danish. A projected third season of the series was derailed by the death in 1998 of [[Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd]], who played Dr. Helmer, and that of [[Kirsten Rolffes]], who played Mrs. Drusse, in 2000, two of the major characters.\n\n=== Inventing the Dogme 95 manifesto ===\n[[File:Dogme28.jpg|thumb|''[[Dogme 95]]'' Certificate for Susanne Bier's film ''[[Open Hearts]]'']] In 1995 von Trier and [[Thomas Vinterberg]] presented their manifesto for a new cinematic movement, which they called [[Dogme 95]].

A documentary chronicling the project was directed by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0418697/ Jesper Jargil], and was released in 2000 with the title ''[[De Udstillede]]'' (The Exhibited).\n\n=== The ''Golden Heart'' trilogy ===\nVon Trier achieved his greatest international success with his ''Golden Heart'' trilogy. Each film in the trilogy is about naive heroines who maintain their \"golden hearts\" despite the tragedies they experience.

''Dogville'' and ''Manderlay'' were both shot with the same distinctive, extremely stylized approach, placing the actors on a bare [[sound stage]] with no set decoration and the buildings' walls marked by chalk lines on the floor, a style inspired by 1970s televised theatre. ''[[Dogville]]'' (2003) starred [[Nicole Kidman]] and ''[[Manderlay]]'' (2005) starred [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in the same main role as Grace Margaret Mulligan. Both films have casts of major international actors, including [[Harriet Andersson]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[James Caan]], [[Danny Glover]], and [[Willem Dafoe]], and question various issues relating to American society, such as intolerance (in ''Dogville'') and slavery (in ''Manderlay'').\n\n===''The Boss of It All'' and ''The Early Years''===\nIn 2006 von Trier released a Danish-language comedy film, ''[[The Boss of It All]]''. It was shot using an experimental process that he has called [[Automavision]], which involves the director choosing the best possible fixed camera position and then allowing a computer to randomly choose when to tilt, pan, or zoom.\n\nFollowing ''[[The_Boss_of_It_All|The Boss of It All]]'', von Trier scripted an autobiographical film, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1|da|3=De unge \u00e5r: Erik Nietzsche sagaen del 1}}'' in 2007, which went on to be directed by [[Jacob Thuesen]]. The film tells the story of von{{nbsp}}Trier's years as a student at the National Film School of Denmark. It stars [[Jonatan Spang]] as von{{nbsp}}Trier's alter ego, called \"Erik Nietzsche\", and is narrated by von{{nbsp}}Trier himself.
