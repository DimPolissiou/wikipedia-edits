See WP:ENGVAR for more info.--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of [[Liam Gallagher]] (lead vocals, tambourine), [[Paul Arthurs]] (guitar), [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]] (bass guitar), and [[Tony McCarroll]] (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother, [[Noel Gallagher]] (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, which formed the band's core and settled line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members until the group's dissolution.\n\nOasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). The following year the band recorded ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], in the midst of a [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|chart rivalry]] with [[Britpop]] peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], selling over 22 million copies worldwide, and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each night, which were at the time the largest outdoor concerts in UK history. 2.5 million people applied for tickets, which remains the highest demand for a show in British history. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997); although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, and went on to sell 8 million copies, its popularity tapered off quickly.\n\nMcGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist/frontman [[Gem Archer]] and former [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist/frontman [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]], with White also later departing in 2004,  replaced by [[Zak Starkey]] and later [[Chris Sharrock]] as touring members. The band subsequently released 3 more studio albums; ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' (2002), ''[[Don't Believe The Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008) to moderate critical and commercial success. However, in August 2009 the band abruptly split up after the departure of Noel. Following the departure of Noel, Liam and the rest of the band decided to continue under the name [[Beady Eye]] and Noel formed a solo project, [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].<ref name=\"End of Oasis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/liam-gallagher-renames-oasis_1131186 |title=Oasis \u2013 Liam Gallagher renames Oasis |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011}}</ref> Following the disbandment of Beady Eye in 2014, Liam began a solo career with Arthurs occasionally joining him on tour, Bell reunited with former band Ride, while Archer and Sharrock became members of Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds.\n\nOasis are among the most successful acts on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and [[UK Albums Chart|Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Oasis-Coldplay-Take-That-enter-Guinness-World-Records-2010-Book/blog/713512/7691.html|title=Oasis, Coldplay & Take That enter Guinness World Records 2010 Book \u2013 Guinness World Records Blog post|date=|publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124221745/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Oasis-Coldplay-Take-That-enter-Guinness-World-Records-2010-Book/blog/713512/7691.html|archivedate=24 January 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/24788|title=Oasis receive Outstanding Brit Award|date=19 October 2006|work=NME.COM|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oasisinet.com/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825180037/http://www.oasisinet.com/|date=25 August 2015}}</ref> They have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums.

Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance [[Liam Gallagher]] as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an [[Inspiral Carpets]] tour poster in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom which listed the [[Oasis Leisure Centre]] in [[Swindon]] as a venue.<ref>Harris, John. ''Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock''. Da Capo Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-306-81367-X}}, pg.&nbsp;124\u201325</ref>\n\nOasis played their first gig on 18 August 1991 at the [[Boardwalk (music club)|Boardwalk]] club in Manchester. Liam's brother [[Noel Gallagher]], a [[road crew|roadie]] for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, he began to consider the possibility of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. \"He had loads of stuff written,\" Arthurs recalled. \"When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;125\u201326</ref> Under Noel, Oasis crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing [[barre chord]]s and [[root (chord)|root bass notes]], McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;127\u201328</ref>\n\n===1993\u20131995: Breakthrough with ''Definitely Maybe'' ===\nAfter over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape, Oasis's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner [[Alan McGee]]. Oasis were invited to play a gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] club in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night's set list; the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get into the club.<ref>VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see [[18 Wheeler (band)|18 Wheeler]], one of his own bands. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later.<ref>\"Oasis.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with [[Sony]], which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 131</ref>\nFollowing a limited white label release of the demo of their song \"Columbia\", Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, \"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]\", playing venues such as the Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. Supersonic was released in April 1994, reaching number&nbsp;31 in the charts.<ref>Harris, pg. 149</ref> The release was followed by \"[[Shakermaker]]\", which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, \"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]\", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', was released on 29 August 1994, entering the charts at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 178</ref>\n\nNearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a [[tambourine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|title=Born To Feud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>  The incident upset Noel to such an extent he temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song \"[[Talk Tonight]]\" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, the elder Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref> The group followed up with the fourth single from ''Definitely Maybe'', \"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]\", and the Christmas single \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\", issued in December 1994 which entered the British charts at number three.<ref>Harris, pg. 213</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', international success, and peak popularity===\nOasis had their first UK number one single in April 1995 with \"[[Some Might Say]]\". At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was \"unlawfully expelled from the partnership\" for what he called a \"personality clash\" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|title=Supanet entertainment music feature|publisher=Supanet.com|accessdate=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622220353/https://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|title=\u00a3550,000 for sacked Oasis drummer|work=BBC News|date=3 March 1999|accessdate=3 February 2008}}</ref> McCarroll was replaced by [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], formerly of [[Starclub]] and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] and recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]].

Previously, Oasis did not associate themselves with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the [[BBC]]'s ''Britpop Now'' programme introduced by Blur singer Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|\"Battle of Britpop\"]] that dominated the national news.<ref>{{cite news |title=When Blur beat Oasis in the battle of Britpop |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |accessdate=17 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> Blur's \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\" outsold Oasis' \"[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]\" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week.<ref>Harris, pg. 235</ref> Oasis' management came up with several reasons for this, claiming \"Country House\" sold more because it was less expensive (\u00a31.99 vs \u00a33.99) and because there were two versions of \"Country House\" with different B-sides, forcing serious fans to buy two copies.<ref>Harris, pg. 233</ref> An alternative explanation given at the time by Creation was that there were problems associated with the barcode on the \"Roll with It\" single case, which did not record all sales.<ref>Author unknown. \"Cockney revels\".

Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying that Liam said, \"If he can play the guitar, he can play the fookin' bass\"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis' back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled tour of America in December 1999.\n\nWith the folding of Creation Records, Oasis formed their own label, [[Big Brother Recordings|Big Brother]], which released all of Oasis' subsequent records in the UK and Ireland. Oasis' fourth album, ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', was released in February 2000 to good first-week sales. It reached number one on the British charts and peaked at number&nbsp;24 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref>[http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=album&atype=0&country=172&idx=19 Oasis \u2013 Official Website \u2013 Discography] retrieved on 15 December 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005304/http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=album&atype=0&country=172&idx=19 |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=oasis|chart=all}} Billboard.com \u2013 Discography \u2013 Oasis \u2013 Standing on the Shoulders of Giants]{{dead link|date=February 2011}} retrieved on 15 December 2007</ref> Four singles were released from the album: \"[[Go Let It Out]]\", \"[[Who Feels Love?]]\", \"[[Sunday Morning Call]]\" and \"[[Where Did It All Go Wrong?]]\", which the first three were top five UK singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/|title=Top 40 Singles|publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220614/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/|archivedate=16 October 2015}}</ref>  The \"Go Let It Out\" video was shot before Bell joined the group and therefore featured the unusual line-up of Liam on rhythm guitar, Archer on lead guitar and Noel on bass.

[[Johnny Marr]] provided additional guitar as well as backup vocals on a couple of songs.\n\nAfter the album's release, the band embarked on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, while the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist [[Jay Darlington]] were involved in a car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, the latter half of the German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a [[Munich]] nightclub.

The album was originally planned for a September 2004 release, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of ''Definitely Maybe''. However, long-time drummer Alan White, who at this time had played on nearly all of the band's material, left the band in early January 2004. At the time, his brother Steve White stated on his own website that \"the spirit of being in a band was kicked out of him\" and he wanted to be with his girlfriend.<ref>[http://www.whiteydrums.com/ Drumming website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815014323/http://www.whiteydrums.com/ |date=15 August 2015 }}</ref> White was replaced by [[Zak Starkey]], drummer of [[the Who]] and the son of [[the Beatles]]' [[Ringo Starr]]. Though Starkey performed on studio recordings and toured with the band, he was not officially a member and the band were a four-piece for the first time in their career. Starkey played publicly for the first time at [[The Lighthouse (Poole)|Poole Lighthouse]].\n\nA few days later, Oasis, with Starkey, headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival]] for the second time in their career and performed a largely greatest hits set, which included two new songs&nbsp;\u2014 Gem Archer's \"A Bell Will Ring\" and Liam Gallagher's \"The Meaning of Soul\".

In May 2005, after three years and as many scrapped recording sessions, the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'', fulfilling their contract with [[Sony BMG]].

Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother, [[Noel Gallagher]] (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, which formed the band's core and settled line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members until the group's dissolution.\n\nOasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). The following year the band recorded ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], in the midst of a [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|chart rivalry]] with [[Britpop]] peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], selling over 22 million copies worldwide, and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each night, which were at the time the largest outdoor concerts in UK history. 2.5 million people applied for tickets, which remains the highest demand for a show in British history. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997); although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, and went on to sell 8 million copies, its popularity tapered off quickly.\n\nMcGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist/frontman [[Gem Archer]] and former [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist/frontman [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]], with White also later departing in 2004,  replaced by [[Zak Starkey]] and later [[Chris Sharrock]] as touring members. The band subsequently released 3 more studio albums; ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' (2002), ''[[Don't Believe The Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008) to moderate critical and commercial success. However, in August 2009 the band abruptly split up after the departure of Noel. Following the departure of Noel, Liam and the rest of the band decided to continue under the name [[Beady Eye]] and Noel formed a solo project, [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].<ref name=\"End of Oasis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/liam-gallagher-renames-oasis_1131186 |title=Oasis \u2013 Liam Gallagher renames Oasis |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011}}</ref> Following the disbandment of Beady Eye in 2014, Liam began a solo career with Arthurs occasionally joining him on tour, Bell reunited with former band Ride, while Archer and Sharrock became members of Noel Gallagher\u2019s High Flying Birds.\n\nOasis are among the most successful acts on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and [[UK Albums Chart|Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Oasis-Coldplay-Take-That-enter-Guinness-World-Records-2010-Book/blog/713512/7691.html|title=Oasis, Coldplay & Take That enter Guinness World Records 2010 Book \u2013 Guinness World Records Blog post|date=|publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124221745/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Oasis-Coldplay-Take-That-enter-Guinness-World-Records-2010-Book/blog/713512/7691.html|archivedate=24 January 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/24788|title=Oasis receive Outstanding Brit Award|date=19 October 2006|work=NME.COM|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oasisinet.com/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825180037/http://www.oasisinet.com/|date=25 August 2015}}</ref> They have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums.

Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance [[Liam Gallagher]] as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an [[Inspiral Carpets]] tour poster in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom which listed the [[Oasis Leisure Centre]] in [[Swindon]] as a venue.<ref>Harris, John.

Da Capo Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-306-81367-X}}, pg.&nbsp;124\u201325</ref>\n\nOasis played their first gig on 18 August 1991 at the [[Boardwalk (music club)|Boardwalk]] club in Manchester. Liam's brother [[Noel Gallagher]], a [[road crew|roadie]] for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, he began to consider the possibility of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. \"He had loads of stuff written,\" Arthurs recalled. \"When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;125\u201326</ref> Under Noel, Oasis crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing [[barre chord]]s and [[root (chord)|root bass notes]], McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable.\"<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;127\u201328</ref>\n\n===1993\u20131995: Breakthrough with ''Definitely Maybe'' ===\nAfter over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape, Oasis's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner [[Alan McGee]]. Oasis were invited to play a gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] club in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night's set list; the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get into the club.<ref>VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see [[18 Wheeler (band)|18 Wheeler]], one of his own bands. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later.<ref>\"Oasis.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with [[Sony]], which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 131</ref>\nFollowing a limited white label release of the demo of their song \"Columbia\", Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, \"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]\", playing venues such as the Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. Supersonic was released in April 1994, reaching number&nbsp;31 in the charts.<ref>Harris, pg. 149</ref> The release was followed by \"[[Shakermaker]]\", which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, \"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]\", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', was released on 29 August 1994, entering the charts at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 178</ref>\n\nNearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a [[tambourine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|title=Born To Feud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>  The incident upset Noel to such an extent he temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song \"[[Talk Tonight]]\" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, the elder Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref> The group followed up with the fourth single from ''Definitely Maybe'', \"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]\", and the Christmas single \"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]\", issued in December 1994 which entered the British charts at number three.<ref>Harris, pg. 213</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', international success, and peak popularity===\nOasis had their first UK number one single in April 1995 with \"[[Some Might Say]]\". At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was \"unlawfully expelled from the partnership\" for what he called a \"personality clash\" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|title=Supanet entertainment music feature|publisher=Supanet.com|accessdate=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622220353/https://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|title=\u00a3550,000 for sacked Oasis drummer|work=BBC News|date=3 March 1999|accessdate=3 February 2008}}</ref> McCarroll was replaced by [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], formerly of [[Starclub]] and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] and recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]].

Previously, Oasis did not associate themselves with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the [[BBC]]'s ''Britpop Now'' programme introduced by Blur singer Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the [[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|\"Battle of Britpop\"]] that dominated the national news.<ref>{{cite news |title=When Blur beat Oasis in the battle of Britpop |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |accessdate=17 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> Blur's \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\" outsold Oasis' \"[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]\" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week.<ref>Harris, pg. 235</ref> Oasis' management came up with several reasons for this, claiming \"Country House\" sold more because it was less expensive (\u00a31.99 vs \u00a33.99) and because there were two versions of \"Country House\" with different B-sides, forcing serious fans to buy two copies.<ref>Harris, pg. 233</ref> An alternative explanation given at the time by Creation was that there were problems associated with the barcode on the \"Roll with It\" single case, which did not record all sales.<ref>Author unknown. \"Cockney revels\".

Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK number&nbsp;one single \"[[D'You Know What I Mean?]]\", the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention.

[[Johnny Marr]] provided additional guitar as well as backup vocals on a couple of songs.\n\nAfter the album's release, the band embarked on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, while the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist [[Jay Darlington]] were involved in a car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result.

The album was originally planned for a September 2004 release, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of ''Definitely Maybe''. However, long-time drummer Alan White, who at this time had played on nearly all of the band's material, left the band in early January 2004. At the time, his brother Steve White stated on his own website that \"the spirit of being in a band was kicked out of him\" and he wanted to be with his girlfriend.<ref>[http://www.whiteydrums.com/ Drumming website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815014323/http://www.whiteydrums.com/ |date=15 August 2015 }}</ref> White was replaced by [[Zak Starkey]], drummer of [[the Who]] and the son of [[the Beatles]]' [[Ringo Starr]]. Though Starkey performed on studio recordings and toured with the band, he was not officially a member and the band were a four-piece for the first time in their career. Starkey played publicly for the first time at [[The Lighthouse (Poole)|Poole Lighthouse]].\n\nA few days later, Oasis, with Starkey, headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival]] for the second time in their career and performed a largely greatest hits set, which included two new songs&nbsp;\u2014 Gem Archer's \"A Bell Will Ring\" and Liam Gallagher's \"The Meaning of Soul\".

In May 2005, after three years and as many scrapped recording sessions, the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'', fulfilling their contract with [[Sony BMG]]. It followed the path of ''Heathen Chemistry'' as being a collaborative project again, rather than a Noel-written album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/oasis/7660|title=NME news article|date=12 September 2005|work=NME.COM|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> The album was the first in a decade not to feature drumming by Alan White, marking the recording debut of Starkey.

Guards!]]'' (1989), \"[[Theatre of Cruelty (Discworld)|Theatre of Cruelty]]\" (1993) (a short story), ''[[Men at Arms]]'' (1993), ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'' (1996), ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' (1997), ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' (1999), ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' (2002), ''[[Thud!]]'' (2005) and ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'' (2011).\n\nThe Watch is also to be the subject of a police procedural television series in development as of 2018,<ref>{{cite web|title=Editorial|url=http://discworldmonthly.co.uk/dwm0222.php|accessdate=28 February 2016|newspaper=Discworld Monthly|date=November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/meet-rhianna-pratchett--the-woman-behind-the-lara-croft-backstory-424300.html|title=Meet Rhianna Pratchett - The woman behind the Lara Croft backstory|date=2016-10-06|access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref> entitled ''[[The Watch (TV series)|The Watch]]''.\n\n==Style==\nPratchett's Watch has been described as part of a longstanding fantasy tradition where the characters of the city watch would \"rush in and die, or run away\", with Pratchett's approach to that tradition ranging from parody in the earlier novels to \"deeper satire\" in the later ones.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YSFEwHD6FQ0C&pg=PT238 The Turtle Moves!: Discworld's Story Unauthorized] by [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]]</ref>\n\n==Fictional history (before the time the novels are set in)==\n'''''Note:''''' ''Some of the information repeated below was taken from ''[[The Discworld Companion]]'' and the ''1999 [[Discworld Diary]]'', which had a City Watch theme, and has not been confirmed in any of the ''Discworld'' novels.''\n\nThe \"Ankh-Morpork Watch & Ward\" was founded in AM 1561 by King Veltrick I. They had full [[copper]] armour and a copper shield inscribed \"''Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter''\" (\"Make the Day, the Moments Pass Quickly\", Veltrick's motto). Four days later Veltrick's son assassinated him, and became Veltrick II. Since he had little interest in maintaining a police force, the equipment of the Watch quickly deteriorated.\n\nAt this time there were four separate forces:\n* The \"Palace Guard\", who guarded the palace.\n* The \"Cable Street Particulars\", a political police force concentrating on discovering \"plots\" against the current rulers of the city. The name may have been inspired by the [[Baker Street Irregulars]] from the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]], and perhaps by the [[Battle of Cable Street]], a riot started between [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] and anti-fascist protesters in 1936. They are also known as The [[Unmentionables]] (a colloquial British term for underwear), possibly a parody of [[Irish National Invincibles|The Invincibles]], an Irish extremist nationalist group, or of [[The Untouchables (law enforcement)|The Untouchables]], a [[prohibition]]-era law-enforcement group, who served as government intelligence.\n* The \"Ward\", who acted as gate-guards, [[thief-taker]]s etc. during the day.\n* The \"Watch\", who served the same purpose in the hours of darkness. The force comprised one commander, five captains, ten sergeants, forty corporals, lance-corporals, constables and lance-constables, and, in times of emergency, a \"citizens militia\" of varied size.\n\nPublic opinion of the Watches (the Ward became known as the Day Watch) was never high, and reached an all-time low when a Commander, who had told the public not to take the law into their own hands, was thrown onto the Ankh with a cry of \"If it's not in our hands, whose hands is it in?\" The Guilds were policing themselves by this point, so the Watch was becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\nThe Watch had a brief respite in AM 1688, following the Ankh-Morpork Civil War, when Commander Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes and his Ironheads became the city's rulers. However, after he was deposed in favour of the [[Havelock Vetinari|Patricianship]], the Watch sank even further into obscurity; he was (until recently) the last Watch Commander. Under the rule of the Patricians, not only did Guild Law apply in the Guilds, but the only laws that applied anywhere else were the whims of the man in charge.\n\nBy the time of Homicidal Lord Winder's rule as Patrician, there were only a handful of Watch Houses remaining. The Cable Street Particulars were thriving, however, having changed from an [[intelligence agency]] into a [[secret police]] force, employing torture with gusto. During the [[Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May]], their building was burnt down by members of the Night Watch from Treacle Mine Road. The change in Patricians did not lead to an improvement in perceptions of the Watch, and when Lord Vetinari replaced [[Discworld characters#Lord Snapcase|Mad Lord Snapcase]], and even theft was legalised, there seemed to be no point to them at all.\n\nThe dysfunctional Night Watch now comprised three men, based in the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House. While the Day Watch had become another of the city's gangs, the Night Watch was just inactive.\n\n== History according to plot of novels ==\nThis changed when Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson joined, and the Night Watch saved the city from a [[European dragon|dragon]]. Following the destruction of their Watch House, they moved to larger premises in Pseudopolis Yard (a name reminiscent of [[Scotland Yard]]) and started recruiting more members, especially from ethnic minorities such as [[dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarfs]], [[troll (Discworld)|trolls]] and the undead. The Watch has even admitted a [[vampire]]. When they saved the Patrician's life Vetinari agreed to increase the force's stature, with new Section Houses being built around the city. The remains of the Day Watch were incorporated into a new City Watch, commanded by [[Sam Vimes]].\n\nSince then, the Watch has become a proper police force, dealing in crime prevention and investigation, rather than simple \"thief-taking\". They now have a [[forensics]] section, a Traffic Division and the long-gone Cable Street Particulars have been replaced by a plain-clothes division. A Watch Academy has been set up, although watchmen trained there often get \"poached\" by other [[Sto Plains]] city-states who have seen the advantages such a force has. Vimes tolerates this, because it is useful that coppers all over the plains have been trained to obey him.\n\nAnother recent addition are \"the [[Special Constabulary|Specials]]\", based on the Watch's ancient right to establish a Citizen's [[Militia]] as needed. Known members include the [[Librarian (Discworld)|Librarian]] (who was actually made a Special Constable long before the Militia was set up); Mr Boggis of the Thieves' Guild; Sam Vimes' butler Willikins; and a [[Technology of the Discworld#The clacks|clacks]] operative named Andy \"Two Swords\" Hancock who carries a disturbing amount of weaponry.\n\nThe Watch's current motto is \"''FABRICATI DIEM, PVNC''\", as inscribed on the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House; presumably the last part of the original \"''Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter''\" had been lost. This is nonsense in Latin, and doesn't actually mean \"[[Go ahead, make my day|Make my day]], punk\", although it looks as though it ought to; this is the nature of most \"[[Discworld (world)#Latatian|Latatian]]\" in the books, and is not unusual. Fred Colon insists it means \"To protect and serve\". The motto of the Vimes family is ''\"Protego et servio\"'', or \"I protect and serve\".\n\nMore and more watchmen trained by the City Watch prefer to work in other cities abroad where they can earn good money thanks to their outstanding qualification and ethics. They are referred to as \"Sammies\" (similar to \"Bobbies\", a term for British police officers derived from the common abbreviation of the first name of Sir Robert Peel, the man credited with the creation of the first regular, uniformed, police service in the UK) and communicate with each other by telegraph (\"clacks\"), a reference to real-world Interpol (mentioned in ''The Night Watch'').\n\n==Members==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ankh-Morpork City Watch.jpg|thumb|270px|The vigilant Ankh-Morpork City Watch in [[Guards! Guards!]]. From left to right: [[Nobby Nobbs]], [[Carrot Ironfoundersson]], [[Sam Vimes]] and [[Fred Colon]]. Second row: Dragon. Illustration by [[Paul Kidby]].]] -->\n\nThe primary members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are (see the linked articles for full details of the characters):\n\n===Commander Sir Samuel Vimes===\n{{Main|Sam Vimes}}\nSamuel Vimes is the Commander of the City Watch, it is all he has ever known and he now brings the dirty tricks he learned as a street copper to his new role.\nHe also makes sure to pass these tricks of the trade on to new recruits.\nUnder Sam Vimes, the Watch has strengthened its position, making many enemies (Although the Assassin's Guild no longer accept contracts). \nIn his time in the Watch he has married the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork, Lady Sybil, and had a son with her, young Sam.\n\n===Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson===\nAdopted by [[Dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarfs]] as an infant after the deaths of his human parents, Carrot grew up down in the mines of the Copperhead mountains. He is \"six feet tall and nearly as broad across the shoulders\". His dwarfish name is ''Kzad-bhat'', which, roughly translated, means \"Head Banger\", a logical nickname for a {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|adj=mid|-tall}} man living in a mine built by {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} dwarfs. He was quite surprised the day he was informed that he was human. His adoptive father thought that he ought to go and live amongst humans, and found him a job with the Ankh-Morpork Night Watch under the misapprehension that they were respected and respectable. Carrot was \"barely 16 years old\" at this time.\n\nCarrot joined the Night Watch while it was only a small group of misfits who ran from evildoers rather than arrest them (see ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''). He had difficulty with this attitude, as his \"old-fashioned\" view of justice led him to arrest the leader of the entirely legal Thieves' Guild on his first day. He since has learned to understand the city a bit better. The city learned about him as quickly when he won in a fight against every miscreant in the Mended Drum tavern, including the then doorman [[Sergeant Detritus|Detritus]] the troll.\n\nCaptain Carrot has made quite a name for himself, rapidly and effortlessly coming to know all of the city's one-million population by name and tax papers. He is big on paperwork and organization and always (often to the dismay of his girlfriend and fellow officer, [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]]) takes time to see all sides of a story before getting involved. When [[Sam Vimes]] planned to retire after his marriage to [[Lady Sybil Ramkin]], Carrot was named his successor. He is not particularly skilled in comma placement and has a bit of trouble with the whole concept of \"[[I before E except after C|i before e]]\". He is considered \"the Disc's most linear thinker\". For instance, as part of a murder investigation, [[Theatre of Cruelty (Discworld)|he interviews]] [[Death (Discworld)|Death]]. Carrot is also famous enough that there are [[action figure]]s of him available (as seen in the novel ''[[Hogfather]]'').\n\nCarrot's main talents are his genuine interest in and liking for people (particularly when contrasted with his boss and friend, [[Sam Vimes]] who \"doesn't like anybody\") and his charisma and \"supernatural likability\". He is often shown to be able to get people to do things no one else could force them to do, simply by assuming that they will; for example, he has great success in his outreach programs to at-risk Ankh-Morporkian youth by treating them like boy scouts. When he directly commands someone, they find it supremely difficult to disobey (even Vimes is shown on one occasion as being susceptible to this power). However, he prefers not to utilize this extreme of his power except in dire emergencies.\n\nCarrot is often thought of as non-threatening, which is a dangerous conclusion if you are the unlucky person who disappoints his honest nature. People think of Carrot as being simple, and the narrator will occasionally point out that this is true<ref>eg in Men at Arms</ref> - however, people often make the mistake of confusing \"simple\" with \"stupid\". Carrot's simplicity is his cunning. In ''[[Soul Music (novel)|Soul Music]]'', Carrot adds supplementary questions to the quiz machine in the Mended Drum, asking players who was responsible for recent crimes and frequently making arrests as a result. Carrot often sees the bright side of life. When Angua, a werewolf, tells him that her brother Andrei is stuck in wolf form and is forced to live as a champion sheepdog, Carrot notes that he ''is'' a champion. Carrot has also promised Angua that, should she ever follow in her brother Wolfgang's murderous footsteps, he will be the one to stop her.\n\nWhile it is common knowledge that Carrot is the true [[Heir apparent|heir to the throne]] of Ankh-Morpork, he doesn't acknowledge it, and has even hidden evidence of his royal heritage. The Patrician, [[Havelock Vetinari]], considers him useful for this reason as well as others, as it means that any attempt to start a [[revolution]] under the claim of being true heir is impossible, and that if anyone complains that only a king has the authority to do something he does, he can simply defer to Carrot.\n\nCarrot himself never uses his royal powers or acknowledges his royal heritage. After having learned about it (''[[Men at Arms]]''), he confides in Vetinari that he wants the people to obey the law because it's the law, not because \"Captain Carrot is good at being obeyed\", and that he is content with his job of ringing a bell and yelling that all's well \"provided of course that 'all is well'\".\n\nCarrot does, however on rare occasions, hint at his royal powers to make things happen. In ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', Lord Vetinari gives Sam Vimes the title of Duke, something only a King can do, while Carrot is present\u2014Vetinari goes so far as to say that he \"had been reminded\" that Vimes could have that title. In ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', when faced with the defection of most members of the Watch under Sergeant Fred Colon (then an Acting-Captain), Carrot puts his (plain and battered) royal sword on a desk in plain sight and reminds Watch members that they had taken an oath to the King, and that the King had not relieved them of it.\n\nCarrot is a stereotypical \"perfect\" policeman; totally honest, law abiding and determined to be friends with everyone. People of all species can't help wanting to behave well in his presence. He has an attitude of loving everyone. His philosophy of love for everyone has caused distress for Angua. She worries that his love toward her is equal to that he gives everyone else and not special. While he would place the welfare of the public above hers (and his own), when she was in danger he travelled to the rim of the Disc to save her.\n\nCarrot's attitude towards his relationship is considered particularly unusual. During ''Jingo'', Angua is kidnapped on a [[Klatch]]ian ship and the watch pursues them. Carrot does not stand at the front of the ship fraught with worry but, sensibly, gets some sleep so he will be ready to rescue her when they catch up. Although [[Sam Vimes]] and the ship's captain see the sense of this, they can't believe that someone in love could be so sensible.\n\nIn ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'' Pratchett says that Carrot has a bright future ahead of him, \"should Lord Vetinari not survive the next assassination attempt\". He also notes that, although most people envision Carrot as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], he is actually modeled after [[Liam Neeson]]. In both the ''[[Discworld (video game)|Discworld]]'' computer game and the [[BBC Radio]] production of ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' he speaks with a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] accent. His character is also reminiscent of [[Constable]] [[Benton Fraser]] from ''[[Due South]]'' (who also has a [[wolf]] companion) but Carrot and Angua were an item before Due South was broadcast.\n\n===Captain Angua von \u00dcberwald===\nCaptain '''Delphine Angua von \u00dcberwald''' first appeared in ''[[Men at Arms]]''. Angua is a member of the [[Ankh-Morpork]] City Watch, originally hired as part of an [[affirmative action]] plan by [[Havelock Vetinari]]. Her physical beauty led colleagues to predict that criminals would be lining up to be arrested by her, but Angua's surprising strength and tough attitude soon made her one of the most feared officers on the Watch. Angua is a [[werewolf]], though she maintains a strict [[vegetarian]] diet during her human phase and only eats chickens during her wolf phase, for which she leaves discreet payments afterwards.  \n\nIn the 1999 computer game ''[[Discworld Noir]]'', and the 2001 books-on-tape version of ''Men at Arms'', her name is pronounced \"An-gyoo-uh\" with a hard \"g\". Terry Pratchett writes on the terrypratchettbooks.com forum: \"it's Ang as in Anger, u as in you, a as in a thing\".\n\nAngua comes from a family of werewolves. She is the daughter of a Baron and Baroness of [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]], and has two brothers, Wolfgang and Andrei. Her sister, Elsa, is deceased, killed by Wolfgang, who disguised it as an accident. Both Andrei and Elsa were \"Yennorks\", werewolves that are stuck in one form (Andrei always appeared to be a wolf, and Elsa a human). Angua and Wolfgang are the only children in their family with shape-shifting ability, known as \"bi-morphs\". Wolfgang is extremely violent and enjoys killing, even eating, \"inferior\" humans. Angua, partially in reaction to what Wolfgang did to their sister, rebels against the traditional werewolf lifestyle of her parents and brother and leaves \u00dcberwald. Andrei manages to slip away as well and enjoys a career as a talented sheep herder.\n\nAfter moving to Ankh-Morpork, Angua soon became the first woman to join the ranks of the City Watch. She met Corporal [[#Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson|Carrot Ironfoundersson]] in the Watch, and the two soon fell in love. Since recovering from his initial surprise (which involved drawing his sword), Carrot has not seemed bothered by the fact that Angua is a werewolf. However, Angua often worries that their different backgrounds and needs will eventually doom the relationship.\n\nOne of Angua's closest friends in the Watch is [[Dwarfs (Discworld)#Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom|Cheery Littlebottom]] the [[dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarf]]. In ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', Angua helps encourage Cheery to \"come out\" as a woman (dwarf society expects both male and female dwarves to behave in an indistinguishable way), even lending her dresses and make-up. At the same time, Angua conceals her true nature as a werewolf from Cheery because she knows her new friend hates and fears werewolves. Throughout the book Angua debates with herself over whether it would be best to just return to \u00dcberwald and live among other werewolves. In the end, she decides to stay in Ankh-Morpork.\n\nAngua has also made friends with Gaspode, a matty, hairy canine who gained and lost the talent of human speech in ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]''. He then regains it by the time of ''Men at Arms'' by sleeping too near the [[Unseen University|Unseen University's]] High-Energy Magic building. Gaspode flirts with Angua constantly and has helped her out on missions many times.\n\nIn ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', Watch Commander [[Sam Vimes]] is sent to \u00dcberwald on a diplomatic mission. Lord Vetinari chooses Angua to be a member of the Watch team that will accompany him, but Angua has already left for \u00dcberwald on business of her own. Carrot, assisted by Gaspode the dog, sets out after her. This is the first Discworld book to reveal much about Angua's background, and her parents and brother Wolfgang all figure in the story. Angua's relationship with actual wolves also provides much tension. Wolfgang plays a significant role as the leader of a violent werewolf movement in \u00dcberwald. Ultimately, Vimes kills Wolfgang in a violent confrontation in the city square. Angua is gratified to hear this, as Wolfgang threatened her and anything she cared for while he remained alive.\n\nThe fact that the Watch now has a werewolf has become common knowledge throughout Ankh-Morpork, but that hasn't affected Angua's privacy substantially, as, for obvious reasons, it is generally assumed to be [[#Corporal Nobby Nobbs|Nobby Nobbs]]; Carrot, Vimes, Vetinari and Angua herself all play along, mostly rather amused. However, in ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]'', it is revealed in passing that several members of the Ankh-Morpork aristocracy, as well as the lawyer Mr Slant, are well aware of her nature, and in ''[[Making Money]]'', [[Moist von Lipwig]] also figures this out upon seeing Angua in her werewolf form with Nobby standing beside her and recognizing her hair. Though the widespread recognition of the werewolf presence in the Watch has not inconvenienced Angua on a human level, it has led to a growing sophistication within the city's criminal underworld in evading capture. The first recorded use of a scent bomb is by The New Firm (Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip) in ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]''. Several references to scent bombs have been made since, most notably their usage by Carcer, at the beginning of ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', when he killed Sergeant Stronginthearm.\n\nAngua assists Vimes in another diplomatic mission in ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', and is mentioned in ''[[Going Postal]]'' as being difficult for criminals in Ankh-Morpork to avoid. Angua also appears in a supporting role in ''[[Thud!]]'', where she gains a rival in the form of the Watch's first vampire officer, [[#Lance-Constable Salacia \"Sally\" von Humpeding|Sally]]. Angua is an extremely practical and level-headed person. While not as cynical as Commander [[Sam Vimes]], she balances out Carrot's na\u00efvet\u00e9 (although she occasionally wonders if he's really as innocent as he appears). In human form, Angua is a strict [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. In wolf form, she has a tendency to go after chickens, but she is always careful to go back and slip some money under the door the next day.\n\nThough she is deeply committed to Carrot, even likening herself to being his dog (or as she puts it in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', a wolf that lives with humans) it hasn't stopped others with romantic interest; there is tension with a wolf named Gavin in ''The Fifth Elephant'', and she receives a marriage proposal from the small mutt Mr. Fusspot in ''Making Money''.\n\nIn the events of ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]'' it is noted that Angua has been newly promoted to [[Police captain|Captain]]. Captain Carrot arrests Tiffany Aching after a disturbance in the King's Head involving the Nac Mac Feegles, who are defeated by [[Nac Mac Feegle|Wee Mad Arthur]], another Feegle (the rat catcher from Feet of Clay who rescues Sgt Colon from the King Golem, although he was referred to as a gnome in the original novel). Wee Mad Arthur has now joined the watch, and he tells Tiffany that she shall be escorted by his colleague, Captain Angua. Subsequent (\"main\" as opposed to young-adult) novels also refer to her by this rank.\n\nIn the 2010 Sky television adaptation of ''[[Terry Pratchett's Going Postal|Going Postal]]'', Angua was played by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]].\n\nThe [[Cretaceous]] [[gymnosperm]] species ''[[Czekanowskia anguae]]'' is named after Angua.<ref name=\"anguae\">Watson, J., Lydon, S. J. and Harrison, N. A. (2001).[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/36952440 \"A revision of the English Wealden Flora, III: Czekanowskiales, Ginkgoales & allied Coniferales\"]. Bulletin of the Natural History Museum (Geology Series), 57(1), 29-82.</ref>\n\n===Sergeant Fred Colon===\n'''Frederick \"Fred\" Colon''' is a [[sergeant]], and appears to have been so for a long time. May have been first mentioned in ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'' as \"a Sergeant of The Watch\" who enters the then Broken Drum. He is described on several occasions as \"one of nature's sergeants\". He is overweight, preferring to avoid trouble and exertion, and rather unimaginative. When not on desk duty (a post he gets more often than other sergeants, due to being responsible for working out the rota), he generally \"guards\" bridges or large buildings against theft. He was a [[corporal]] in the Watch at the time [[Sam Vimes]] first joined, and subsequent to this spent some time in the army (the Duke of [[Quirm]]'s Middleweight [[Infantry]] and then the Duke of Eorle's First Heavy Infantry), before returning to the Watch.\n\nIn ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', Colon became the head of the Traffic Squad, which also included his best friend [[#Corporal Nobby Nobbs|Nobby Nobbs]]. This role perfectly fit the above described qualities, especially as the Traffic Squad is \"self-financing\" (i.e. they keep the fines). A brief promotion to acting-captain proved a disaster as everyone, including Colon himself, expected. He is currently holding dual position of Custody Officer and Watch Liaison Officer; jobs so vague that no one is entirely sure what they entail, least of all Colon himself; they serve the dual purpose of preventing his brain from becoming overburdened with responsibility and avoiding the catastrophic possibility that he might be given a task of any real importance. His office, in a separate building from the main watch house, is frequented by old acquaintances who want somewhere quiet to get away from the wife, hear what's happening on the street and\u2014in Vimes' words\u2014\"gossip like washerwomen.\" For this free-flowing source of information, Vimes considers the cost of doughnuts on an expense voucher a very favourable trade.\n\nCloser examination, though, shows that Colon has some hidden depths. As Vimes thought it, most of the other watch officers saw a fat, stupid, lazy, cowardly man and that was mostly what was there, but Colon and Nobby have a street-level knowledge of Ankh-Morpork on a par with Vimes and are good at sensing tension in a crowd. Both are also survivors of the Glorious 25 May when, as described in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', in the aftermath of a coup an assortment of regular police and hangers-on (including an apprentice Assassin called [[Vetinari]]) took out, at some cost, the hard-line remnants of the outgoing regime's secret police. Colon also performs his duties in ''[[Thud!]]'' fairly well. He is an amiable jailer, and bright enough to keep the keys in a closed tin box in the bottom drawer of his desk, well out of reach of anything an inmate would be able to use. He is often portrayed as being prejudiced against \"minority \", even in the Watch, such as dwarves, undead, \"foreigners\", or even women. However, his prejudice is so non-specific and naive (and frequently short-lived when actually exposed to the group in question) that nobody takes it seriously.\n\nHe is possibly related to Sergeant Doppelpunkt (German for \"colon\", as in the punctuation mark), one half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]], seen in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]''. Other [[Discworld characters]] with a notable similarity to Colon include a member of the guard in the \u00dcberwald town of Bonk (who was nicknamed \"Colonesque\" by Samuel Vimes) and one of the market guards in Al Khali, [[Klatch]]. Like the various [[Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler|Dibblers]], this may be due to [[morphic resonance]].\n\nColon is married, though his wife works during the day; since he works at night, the two seldom see each other and instead communicate by leaving notes. Vimes even goes as far as to privately attribute the longevity of Fred's marriage to this fact. In ''Guards! Guards!'' it is noted they have a number of children, a fact which Vimes puts down to 'persuasive handwriting'.\n\nColon made a brief appearance in the [[Cosgrove Hall]] adaptation of ''[[Soul Music (novel)|Soul Music]]''. In the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of ''Guards! Guards!'' he was voiced by [[Stephen Thorne]]. In the 1988 stage play he was played by Roger Bingham. In the Radio 4 adaptation of ''Night Watch'' he was voiced by [[Sam Dale]].\n\n===Corporal Nobby Nobbs===\n'''Cecil Wormsborough St. John \"Nobby\" Nobbs''' is untidy, smelly, and about the same height as a dwarf. Because of this and the fact that he is extremely ugly, he carries a certificate signed by the [[Havelock Vetinari|Patrician]] to prove that, on the [[testimony]] of his [[parent]]s and the [[midwife]] who delivered him, he is probably a human being.  A running joke is the inability of others to believe this, despite&mdash;or even because of&mdash;the evidence. In fact, in ''Hogfather'', even [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] himself was unable to discern Nobby's species. According to the blurb of ''[[Men At Arms]]'', Nobby was \"disqualified from the human race for shoving\". He always seems to have a [[Cigarette litter|cigarette butt]] about him, normally stowed behind his ear.\n\nSamuel Vimes is Nobby's commanding officer, and Sergeant Fred Colon his partner and longtime friend. Together, Nobby and Colon have managed to have many strangely philosophical (or just strange) conversations, including one on whether [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] has a first name, or even any friends to call him it. Oddly enough, these conversations hint at Nobby being more intelligent than Colon, with Nobby continually pointing out fatal flaws in Colon's statements and arguments, and Colon mentally scrambling to come up with an answer (this is not unlike some of the byplay in the [[Laurel and Hardy]] films). Nobby is fond of [[folk dancing]].\n\nAs a child he was a [[street urchin]] and a major source of information for various city notables. His father was abusive, and broke his leg at least once (Vimes notes in ''Night Watch'' that Nobby used to have his arms broken by his father too\u2014and in ''Hogfather'', Nobby claims that he never got anything in his stocking ... except once, when his father vomited into it). The young Nobby sometimes refers to his father as \"Number One Suspect\", and is afraid of going to prison because his father is currently in there. He was apparently inspired to join the Watch after meeting with [[Sam Vimes|Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel]] (or alternatively Sam Vimes, due to time travel), who once gave him a spoon (which his father subsequently stole upon being released from prison).\n\nNobby was once thought to be the [[Earl]] of Ankh, but it was all a charade to make him [[king]] as he would be easier to manipulate than the 'real' heir in the form of [[#Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson|Captain Carrot]]. Nobby proved less tractable than the conspirators had expected, turning down a cushy life as [[figurehead]] ruler of Ankh-Morpork largely, by his own account, for fear of what Vimes would have to say&mdash;or more importantly, ''do''&mdash;when he found out given his and his infamous ancestor's opinions on royalty. It was also due to his family's long-standing belief that they should never [[Volunteering|volunteer]] for anything as there is always going to be a catch. Indeed, he fled the offer at a dead run, all the time terrified Vimes would \"[[Rage (emotion)|go spare]]\". However, at the end of the book ''Feet of Clay'', it is also suggested that he may be a real [[nobleman]], due to the amount of family heirlooms he has not mentioned to any other person. On the other hand, the Nobbses have stolen so much stuff over the years that, as Vimes has said, \"you could probably prove Nobby was the [[Dowager]] [[Duchess]] of [[Quirm]]\".\n\nNobby played a role in the resolution of the \"[[war]]\" between [[Ankh-Morpork]] and the empire of [[Klatch]] in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', and in recognition the Patrician gave him a new job in traffic control. He has since been \"promoted\" to assistant to the Watch Liaison Officer (in other words Fred Colon), a job vague enough to ensure he never has to do anything actually important.\n\nIronically it is also Nobby who ends the war between the dwarves and the trolls. In Thud it is revealed that the Battle of Koom Valley, the main reason for the continuing hatred between those two races, was not supposed to be a war at all but a chance for the Kings of each side to discuss peace. This information is contained in an ancient artifact called a Cube. Nobby, who has been set up as a petty thief from the start, finds and steals the Cube at some point in the book, although we do not find this out until Vimes tells him to hand it over. Vimes works out how to make the Cube play its message, in the presence of the current King of the Dwarves, and the truth of Koom Valley is heard for the first time in hundreds of years.\n\nHe believes he is in a romantic relationship with Verity \"[[Hammerhead shark|Hammerhead]]\" Pushpram, a girl who runs a fish stall and gets her nickname from the fact that her eyes appear to be looking in opposite directions. However, this \"[[Intimate relationship|relationship]]\" seems to consist solely of her hitting him with a fish and telling him to bugger off. He remains \"faithful\" to her, however, in all books except ''[[Thud!]]'', in which he is temporarily in a relationship with exotic dancer [[Discworld characters#Tawneee|Tawneee]]. As of the events of ''Snuff'', he appears to be in a romantic relationship with Shine of the Rainbow, a goblin girl, and it is tacitly suggested that Nobby may have some Goblin in his ancestry, explaining why nobody could be sure of his humanity. This relationship is confirmed in \"[[Raising Steam]]\", when Colon refers to Nobby being \"practically married\", in reference to his own marital arguments with Mrs Colon.\n\nHe is possibly related to Corporal Knopf (as Knopf can be translated as knob), one half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]], seen in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]''. Other ''Discworld'' characters with a notable similarity to Nobby include a member of the guard in the \u00dcberwald town of Bonk, who was nicknamed \"Nobbski\" by Vimes, and one of the market guards in Al Khali, [[Klatch]]. Like the various [[Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler|Dibblers]], this may be due to morphic resonance. Despite this, being related to Nobby is not seen as a good thing in Ankh Morpork. One of the Unseen University bedlows who, by sheer [[coincidence]], shared the same last name as Nobby was incredibly swift to denounce any potential ties of family.\n\nAccording to the ''Pratchett Portfolio'', his typical saying is \"'tis a lie sir, I never done it\" (like all other \"typical sayings\" in the Portfolio (except that of the Death of Rats) he has not actually been recorded saying it).\n\nDuring Nobby's time in Klatch he \"got in touch with his feminine side\", and is quite fond of wearing women's clothing. This can occasionally be useful, as he dressed up as an old lady as part of a [[Traffic stop|Traffic scam]] before being stopped by Vimes.\n\nNobby made a brief appearance in the [[Cosgrove Hall]] adaptation of ''[[Soul Music (novel)|Soul Music]]''. In the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of ''Guards! Guards!'' he was voiced by [[Melvyn Hayes]]. In the 1988 stageplay he was played by David Brett, formerly of the [[Flying Pickets]]. Nobby has also appeared in two computer adventure games, ''[[Discworld (computer game)|Discworld (The Trouble With Dragons)]]'' (where he was voiced by [[Tony Robinson]]) and ''[[Discworld Noir]]'' (where he was voiced by [[Rob Brydon]]). In both cases Nobby had a distinct Irish accent. In the 2006 TV adaptation of ''[[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather|Hogfather]]'' he was played by [[Nicolas Tennant]].\n\n===Sergeant Detritus===\n''See [[Detritus (Discworld)|Trolls (Discworld)]]''\n\n===Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom===\n''See [[Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom|Dwarfs (Discworld)]]''\n\n===Constable Reginald Shoe===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of Discworld characters]] -->\n''See: Undead (Discworld)''\n\n===Lance-Constable Salacia \"Sally\" von Humpeding===\n''See Undead (Discworld)''\n\n===Constable Dorfl===\n''See: [[Dorfl|Golems (Discworld)]]''\n\n\n===Constable Visit-the-Infidel/Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets{{anchor|Constable_Visit}}===\n'''Visit-the-Infidel-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets''' (sometimes referred to as Visit-the-Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets) is a [[Constable]] of the City Watch. He is generally just called \"Constable Visit\", or occasionally by his nickname \"Washpot\". The term comes from one of Visit's favourite quotations, \"Moab is my washpot. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe\", from Psalm&nbsp;60 in ''The Book of Om''. His name is, apparently, shorter in Omnian.\n\nHe first appeared in ''Feet of Clay''. He is referred to by Pratchett as follows: \"There's one in every station, and Constable Visit was enough for two.\" Samuel Vimes says he is a good copper, his highest form of personal praise. He is an Omnian of a gentle but determined [[Proselytism|proselytising]] nature. He can clear a large crowd in seconds, just by talking to them about [[religion]] and threatening them with [[pamphlet]]s, principally ''Unadorned Facts'' and ''Battle Call'' (parodies of ''[[The Plain Truth]]'' and ''[[The War Cry]]'').\n\nIn off-duty moments he goes door to door with his fellow Omnian, Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments. Entire pubs have been known to draw the curtains, turn off the lights and lie on the floor whimpering at news of his coming down the street. The only \"entity\" not afraid of Visit's endless proselytising is his friend and fellow constable Dorfl, a golem with endless patience and a desire to argue faith rationally.\n\nHe appears in the SkyOne television adaptation of ''[[Hogfather]]'', portrayed by [[Richard Katz (actor)|Richard Katz]].\n\n===Inspector A E Pessimal===\n'''A E Pessimal''' was first the government Inspector of the Watch assigned (in ''[[Thud!]]'') by [[Lord Vetinari]] to inspect the Watch and judge whether the Watch gave [[fair value]] for the [[wikt:civic|civic]] [[funding|funds]] it used (\"[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?|who watches the watchmen?]]\") and to inspect the Unseen University in ''[[A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices]]''.\n\nHe is described as a neat little man, with very shiny shoes, and has no friends and no sense of humour. He does not have a first name, as others would understand; he was \"initialled\" at birth rather than named.<ref group=\"note\">Using a single letter (not really an \"initial\" since it's the only letter, not the first) as a name is not actually rare. Famous people with single-letter names include the former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[List of light-heavyweight boxing champions|Light Heavyweight World Champion]] boxer [[J. B. Williamson]], and the late US President Harry S Truman.</ref>\nHe was in a position to seriously inconvenience Vimes with difficult questions such as; \"Why is C.W.St.J. 'Nobby' Nobbs in the Watch? Are you aware you employ a petty criminal?\"\n\nEventually, Vimes decided to shake the man up, and swore him in as a [[special constable]] for the duration of an impending street fight of roughly a thousand trolls and dwarves. Vimes thought he could scare the man while showing him what it was like to be a copper. Instead, A E took his position seriously, to the point of bare-handedly attacking and trying to bite a troll who took a swing at Vimes. This action remains one of the few events to have totally shocked Vetinari, when he heard about it in Vimes' report (\"''Mr Pessimal?'' Mr. A E ''Pessimal''? We are talking about the same person? Small man, very clean shoes?\").\n\nA short while later, A E came to Vimes' office and was offered the position of Lance-Constable and [[adjutant]], with an estimate that he could be a [[Sergeant]] in a year. Vimes' reason for taking A E on was A E's patience and intelligence; Vimes needed someone who could look through paperwork and understand what was being said by sifting out important or suspicious facts. Vimes reasons that A E always wanted to be a Watchman and was stopped by his weak stature. As a condition of his employment, A E was told that he would go on patrol twice a week, so he would be able to learn what's important. A E is also one of the few people Vimes allows to call him \"Mister Vimes\", saying that the man \"earned it all in one go\". Along with Vimes' Dis-Organizer Mark Five (\"[[BlackBerry|The Gooseberry]]\"), it would seem that A E is the start to a [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|new department]] in the City Watch.\n\nBy the events of ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', A E has risen to the newly minted [[Police rank|rank]] of [[Inspector]] in the City Watch, and his [[forensic accounting]] has become legendary and feared throughout Ankh-Morpork, as people fear what he may uncover in their financial records.\n\n===Constable Igor===\n'''Igor''' is an [[Igor (Discworld)|Igor]] who was considered \"too modern\" for [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]] by his family, and went with Samuel Vimes to Ankh-Morpork. He specialises in [[genetics|genetic]] experiments (\"bio-artificing\"), which, on the Discworld, involves really small stitches. His creations include a pet rabbit called Eerie, a particularly suitable name as he grows spare human ears on it (a reference to the human ear equipped mouse of 1995, a few years prior to the creation of the book). Another early experiment was breeding noses, which act as independent lifeforms until sewn on. He also experimented with swimming potatoes in the hopes of breeding instant Fish & Chips. As with all Igors, Constable Igor is highly talented at performing transplant surgery.\n\nHe has a speech \"impediment\" in that he sometimes forgets to lisp. Vimes employs him because of his surgery methods, which Vimes considered to be considerably more advanced than most of Ankh-Morpork's doctors. Igor first appeared in the novel ''The Fifth Elephant''.\n\n===Constable Downspout===\nConstable '''Downspout''', who first appears in ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', is a [[surveillance]] expert for the Watch. Being a [[Troll (Discworld)#Other kinds of troll|gargoyle]], he is capable of remaining motionless in one spot and watching for days at a time, a \"world champion at not moving\" as Vimes once put it. He has no use for money and instead receives his salary in [[Columbidae|pigeon]]s, which he eats.\n\n===Corporal Buggy Swires===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of Discworld characters]] -->\nA [[Gnomes (Discworld)|gnome]]. Introduced in ''Jingo'' (possibly in ''[[The Light Fantastic]]''; there was a gnome identified only as Swires), Buggy possesses the hard-nosed, bellicose personality typical of his species, proving able to shout down uncooperative witnesses despite being only six inches tall. He has since established himself as the sole member of the Watch's Airborne Section through his ability to tame various species of bird (most recently a [[buzzard]], acquired from the pictsies for a crate of whisky) to act as transport, for reconnaissance and messaging purposes.\n\n===Minor Watchmen===\n\n====Special-Constable Andy \"Two Swords\" Hancock====\nMentioned only in ''Thud!'', Andy Hancock is one of the \"Specials\", a group of militia men trained by Sergeant Colon. He is described as being an \"amiable man with an amiable smile\". He fights with two curved [[Agatean Empire|Agatean]] swords and [[nunchaku]], which he calls \"Agatean numknuts\" (a reference to \"numchuks\" a common term for the nunchaku in the United States, and a common accident occurring with their untrained use, as well as to the slang insult \"numbnuts\" meaning \"idiot\"). He is probably either an extremely competent fighter, or just a wild ninja wannabe. It is stated that he destroyed three practice dummies in thirty minutes. When not practicing, Hancock works for the \"Grand Trunk\" clacks company, supplying the Watch with information.\n\n====Sergeant Stronginthearm====\nDwarf desk sergeant, appearing in ''The Fifth Elephant'' and killed just prior to the beginning of ''Night Watch'' by the serial killer known as [[Carcer Dun]].\n\n====Acting-Constable Cuddy====\nIntroduced in ''Men at Arms''. The first dwarf recruit who put aside his differences with trolls and became a good friend to [[Sergeant Detritus|Detritus]]. Killed by Dr. Cruces towards the end of the story. There are overt hints that Carrot may have buried the \"[[Hand cannon|gonne]]\" of the story, as well as the book containing the royal lineage, in Cuddy's coffin to keep it safe (and to give Cuddy a good weapon for the afterlife). He also created the special cooling helmet for [[Sergeant Detritus|Detritus]].\n\n====Constables Flint and Morraine====\nTwo troll watchmen. Introduced in ''Men at Arms'' but only have very minor roles. They were the first two non-watchmen \"sworn in\" (conscripted) into the Carrot's \"Citizen's Militia\" by Detritus, using a special [[Threat|troll oath]] (\"I will do what I told, otherwise I get my goohuloog head kicked in.\"). It is unclear however if these two trolls bear any resemblance to the two trolls, Flint and Morry, in ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]''.\n\nFlint was briefly elevated to sergeant under the tenure of Acting-Captain Fred Colon (promoted to run the watch during the temporary resignations of Carrot and Angua while Vimes, Littlebottom and Detritus were serving as ambassadors to Uberwald in ''The Fifth Elephant''), much to the annoyance of Nobby Nobbs, who had been obviously gunning for the promotion himself.\n\n====Lance-Constable Bluejohn====\nThe Watch's largest Troll officer, Bluejohn is a gentle and retiring troll. He is so big that he is used as the riot shield for the rest of the Watch officers and he is often used during crowd control. This is because, wherever he is sent, he ''is'' the crowd. His name is taken from a type of [[fluorite]] found in [[Derbyshire]], England.\n\n====Corporal Ping====\nIntroduced in ''The Fifth Elephant'', he has a knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. In the midst of a murder investigation, he takes a moment to inform Commander Sir Samuel Vimes that \"ping\" is a dialect word, meaning [[Water-meadow|watermeadow]]. He also appears in ''Night Watch''.\n\n====Andre====\nA plain-clothes watchman of the reformed Cable Street Particulars, working in the Ankh-Morpork Opera House during ''[[Maskerade]]''. Has not been seen or mentioned since, except indirectly in ''Feet of Clay'', when Carrot writes to his parents that there are now \"secret policemen\".\n\n====Constable Wee Mad Arthur====\nSworn in by Fred Colon during the events of ''Feet of Clay''. He was made a special Watchman for that night. His species is never explicitly stated before the novel, ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]'', though Detritus refers to him as a \"''ger-nome''\". During a fight in the [[Pub|King's Head]], in ''I Shall Wear Midnight'', he fights off about thirty members of the Feegle clan from the Chalk, before returning to the Chalk to discover that he is, in fact, a [[Nac Mac Feegle|Feegle]] foundling who was raised by gnomes, much in the same way Carrot was raised by dwarves. He is noted to, like [[#Corporal Buggy Swires|Buggy Swires]] and other Nac Mac Feegle, have human strength in a six-inch body. After returning from [[leave (military)|leave]] in the Chalk, he was instrumental in uncovering the [[Slavery|enslavement]] of [[Mouldavia|Goblins]], exercising the use of his newly learned \"Crawstep\" technique from his time with the Chalk [[Nac Mac Feegle]] clan.\n\n====The Librarian====\n{{Main|Librarian (Discworld)}}\n\nThe librarian of the [[Unseen University]] is a sentient Orangutan (formerly a human, before being magically transformed, who now communicates using only the word \"Ook!\")<ref>{{cite news|title=Book Review: Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Unseen-Academicals-by-Terry-Pratchett-884571.php|accessdate=18 September 2012|last=Bancells|first=Chris|date=26 April 2011|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}</ref> who is one of the Discworld's most frequently recurring characters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview: Terry Pratchett - author|url=http://www.abc.net.au/abc3/articles/s2515692.htm|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=13 March 2009|work=[[ABC3]]}}</ref> Given a badge during the events of ''[[Guards!

The only description of him in this appearance was that he was \"definitely human\", as opposed to the \"probably human\" Nobbs. He is known by the nickname \"Kipper\" by his fellow Watchmen, and Sam Vimes is comfortable enough with him to openly use the name. He later accompanied Commander Vimes on his trip to the dwarves' mine, but was sent away before reaching it with a message for Lady Sybil. During his off-nights, he works security shifts at the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork, where he appeared in ''[[Making Money]]'' apprehending whom he thought to be a would-be robber (actually [[Moist von Lipwig]]) in the vault.\n\nHis next appearance was in ''[[Unseen Academicals]]'', where he found two of the main characters, Trevor Likely and Mr. Nutt, in need of assistance after a football riot spilled over into a gang fight.\n\nIn ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', Haddock is part of a diplomatic exchange programme with the City State of Quirm; Here, he is serving with the city watch at the rank of Acting-Captain; it is unclear if this is a reflection of Haddock's abilities per se, the esteem in which the Ankh-Morpork City Watch \"Sammies\" are held, or simply a function of the exchange programme itself. During these events, Commander Vimes promises his awaited promotion to Sergeant if he can complete a vital task (finding bacon sandwiches at short notice, with the right kind of sauce). Haddock does so, and Vimes signs his promotion on the spot. After this point, Kipper Haddock's location and current duties are unknown.\n\n====Lewton====\nLewton appears in the third Discworld computer game, ''[[Discworld Noir]]''. Lewton is the Disc's first and only [[private investigator]] and a former member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, having been banished from it for taking a [[bribe]].\n\nLewton was once a member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (sometime before the books). Commander [[Sam Vimes]] had a particular unexplained grudge against him. Lewton met and fell in love with a female [[archaeologist]] named Ilsa and seemed to have a happy life; a particular moment fondly remembered was the Hotel Pseudopolis. Life seemed to be going well for Lewton. However, one day, Ilsa left Ankh-Morpork for unexplained reasons and this drew Lewton into a [[clinical depression|depression]]. He spent countless days drinking and drinking. During these hard times, Lewton took a bribe which ended in him being permanently excluded from the Watch. A few years later, Lewton decided to pick himself up, forget about Ilsa and the rest of his past and start a new life. He became a Private Investigator. However, he rarely got any cases.\n\nWhen Carlotta Von Uberwald came into his life, Lewton's life changed forever. She gave him the Mundy Case and although Lewton didn't know it, she used him as a puppet in order to find Mundy (of whom she said was her lover but he was really an informant for her cult). After discovering this they argued, and during this argument Carlotta kissed and bit Lewton, turning him into a werewolf (or some variant type, several of which are named or referenced in the books themselves). Using his new wolf abilities, Lewton managed to put a stop to Carlotta's cult's plans and save Ankh-Morpork from being consumed by a giant \"god of destruction\".\n\nWhile he was working on the Mundy Case, Ilsa came back to his life and it looked like they were going get back together, but much like with Casablanca's ending, at the end of the game Lewton watches her fly away in the Disc's first airplane.\n\n===Former Members===\n\n====Findthee Swing====\nCaptain Swing is the head of the [[#Cable Street Particulars|Unmentionables]] in the [[Ankh-Morpork]] of the past in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]''. Swing is mainly remembered for his attempt to control crime by ordering all weapons confiscated, reasoning that this would result in a decline in crime figures, failing to acknowledge that criminals don't obey the law in the first place and would actually greatly enjoy the lack of weapons in society.\n\nHe is described as a thin, balding man dressed in a long, old-fashioned black coat with large pockets, and supports himself on an opera cane (which is in reality a [[swordstick]]). Swing moves and speaks in an erratic, jumpy fashion, in bursts, and sputters rather than a continuous flow of movement or sound. He is, however, a skilled [[swordsman]], as he does not resort to flashy [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]], but instead actually attacks his opponent.\n\nSwing always carries with him a large set of calipers and a steel ruler, with which he measures the facial characteristics of people he meets in order to determine their personal traits ([[phrenology]]). Its reliability is questionable; according to it, Vimes has the eye of a mass murderer (Vimes says he indeed does ... in his other suit), while Carcer's only problem was his environment (most likely all the dead bodies wherever he went).\n\nHe is killed by Vimes during the fire at the Unmentionables' headquarters. On arriving at the Great Desert he tries to use his phrenological skills to determine Death's character, only to find that Death has no characteristics he can measure.\n\nThe name [[Captain Swing]] has long been associated with civil unrest, being the pseudonym of the (possibly mythical) leader of the [[Swing Riots]].\n\n==== Mayonnaise Quirke and The Day Watch ====\nBefore the merging of the Watches, the Day Watch dealt with all crimes committed during daylight. The only significant Day Watch member mentioned is its captain, \"[[Mayonnaise]]\" Quirke, who first appears in ''Men at Arms''. Quirke is nicknamed \"Mayonnaise\" by the Night Watch as he is rich, thick, oily, and smells faintly of eggs. In ''Night Watch'' he is revealed to be a little bit older than Vimes. He was originally a [[Corporal]] in the Night Watch before kicked out by [[Serjeant-at-Arms|Sergeant-at-Arms]] John Keel (actually Vimes). He joined the Day Watch shortly afterwards and presumably rose to the rank of [[Police captain|captain]] at the same time as Vimes did. During the events of ''Men at Arms'', he is knocked out by Carrot, who tells his men to leave the city; presumably, Quirke left with them.\n\n==Allies==\n\n===71-Hour Ahmed===\nA Klatchian warrior who accompanies the Klatchian envoy Prince Khufurah on a diplomatic journey to Ankh-Morpork in the novel ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]''. He speaks with a heavy accent and has a penchant for chewing on cloves. Following an attempt on the prince's life by an unknown assassin, he is suspected of killing the Watch's prime suspect, provoking Vimes and other Watch members to pursue him back to Klatch (Particularly after he captures [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]] in werewolf form).\n\nApart from belonging to a vicious but honorable warrior clan known as the [[#D'regs|D'reg]]s, he is later revealed to be the [[Wali|Wali of Klatch]], a Klatchian equivalent of a watchman on a par with Vimes (Wali is both a play on the British term \"Wally\", meaning a simpleton or halfwit and an Arabic word equivalent to \"magistrate\"). It also turns out his obsessive clove-chewing and broken Morporkian are in fact a disguise meant to delude foreigners into falsely assuming he is nothing but an uncivilized barbarian. Like many privileged foreigners, he was sent to the Assassins' Guild as a child on the assumption that he would get an excellent education. He confounds Vimes by his fond memories of Ankh-Morpork, and even [[Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler]]. He and Vimes eventually develop a wary respect for each other, mostly based on both of them being basically honest cops in unenviable positions.\n\nHe got his nickname after killing a man (guilty of poisoning a well, and killing a number of villagers and very valuable camels) one hour before the end of the traditional D'reg three days of hospitality, during which even your greatest enemy should be shown respect.\n\n===Willikins===\nButler to [[Sam Vimes|Commander Vimes]] and [[Lady Sybil Vimes|Lady Sibyl]], Willikins was in his youth a member of the Shamlegger Street Rude Boys street gang (whose skills at street violence were respected even by Sam Vimes) where his weapon of choice was [[Oddjob|a cap brim sewn with sharpened pennies]]. In ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' it is revealed that he has been in the service of the Ramkin family for most of his life. His only absence from this employment was during the events in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' when he joined the army during the war against Klatch, during which he was known to alternate between violently yelling at his men for showing disrespect and then politely apologising to Vimes for their actions. It is implied, and almost certainly true, that he bit a man's nose off during the same war.  At some point in his life (almost certainly prior to entering service with the Ramkins), Willikins spent some time in the Tanty (prison), as he explains in ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]''.  Willikins' exaggerated deference and circumlocutory manner of speech strongly echo the character [[Jeeves]] created by [[P G Wodehouse]].\n\nHe has proven himself more than once to be a skilled and ruthless fighter as well as a dutiful butler\u2014sometimes simultaneously: during the events of ''[[Thud!]]'', Willikins is surprised by a Deep-Down Dwarf carrying a flamethrower entering the house illegally, and is \"forced to defend (himself) with the first thing that came to hand\", the 18-inch long sharp serrated-steel ice knife; he also lodged another dwarf on a meathook. It is also revealed in ''Thud!'' that Willikins is a member of the \"Specials\"\u2014The Ankh-Morpork City Militia. However, during the events of ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', Willikins goes to great lengths to avoid being involved with the local version of the Watch, claiming it went against his personal grain to be associated with the forces of Law and Order.\n\n===John \"Mossy\" Lawn===\nA doctor in Ankh-Morpork. He first appeared in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', as a backstreet \"pox doctor\", offering medical assistance to \"seamstresses\". He had trained in [[Klatch]], where he had learnt techniques other Morporkian surgeons distrusted, but which kept patients alive for longer than it took to pay the bill. He also gave free treatment to those who needed it, including those who had been tortured by the Cable Street Particulars. He is quiet, if a tad sarcastic, and almost unshockable. Following his successful delivery of Young Sam, [[Samuel Vimes]] gave him a large area of land in the Goosegate area of the city. In ''[[Going Postal]]'' this is the Lady Sybil Free Hospital. Dr Lawn's preferred method of dealing with the nursing staff is to throw a handful of chocolates in one direction and run in the other as fast as possible. He claims that, when he dies, he wants a bell left on his gravestone so he can have the pleasure of not getting up when people ring.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084014/http://wiki.lspace.org/ Discworld & Pratchett Wiki]\n\n{{Discworld}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[Category:Discworld characters]]\n[[Category:Discworld organisations]]\n[[Category:Fictional law enforcement agencies]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional organization from Terry Pratchett's Discworld novel series}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}\n{{in-universe|date=January 2012}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Ankh-Morpork City Watch''' is the police force of the fictional city of [[Ankh-Morpork]] in the ''[[Discworld]]'' series by the English writer [[Terry Pratchett]].\n\nThe series comprises eight fantasy novels and one short story centred on the adventures of the City Watch and its commander [[Sam Vimes]], in order of publication they are; ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' (1989), \"[[Theatre of Cruelty (Discworld)|Theatre of Cruelty]]\" (1993) (a short story), ''[[Men at Arms]]'' (1993), ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'' (1996), ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' (1997), ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'' (1999), ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' (2002), ''[[Thud!]]'' (2005) and ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'' (2011).\n\nThe Watch is also to be the subject of a police procedural television series in development as of 2018,<ref>{{cite web|title=Editorial|url=http://discworldmonthly.co.uk/dwm0222.php|accessdate=28 February 2016|newspaper=Discworld Monthly|date=November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/meet-rhianna-pratchett--the-woman-behind-the-lara-croft-backstory-424300.html|title=Meet Rhianna Pratchett - The woman behind the Lara Croft backstory|date=2016-10-06|access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref> entitled ''[[The Watch (TV series)|The Watch]]''.\n\n==Style==\nPratchett's Watch has been described as part of a longstanding fantasy tradition where the characters of the city watch would \"rush in and die, or run away\", with Pratchett's approach to that tradition ranging from parody in the earlier novels to \"deeper satire\" in the later ones.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YSFEwHD6FQ0C&pg=PT238 The Turtle Moves!: Discworld's Story Unauthorized] by [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]]</ref>\n\n==Fictional history (before the time the novels are set in)==\n'''''Note:''''' ''Some of the information repeated below was taken from ''[[The Discworld Companion]]'' and the ''1999 [[Discworld Diary]]'', which had a City Watch theme, and has not been confirmed in any of the ''Discworld'' novels.''\n\nThe \"Ankh-Morpork Watch & Ward\" was founded in AM 1561 by King Veltrick I. They had full [[copper]] armour and a copper shield inscribed \"''Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter''\" (\"Make the Day, the Moments Pass Quickly\", Veltrick's motto). Four days later Veltrick's son assassinated him, and became Veltrick II. Since he had little interest in maintaining a police force, the equipment of the Watch quickly deteriorated.\n\nAt this time there were four separate forces:\n* The \"Palace Guard\", who guarded the palace.\n* The \"Cable Street Particulars\", a political police force concentrating on discovering \"plots\" against the current rulers of the city. The name may have been inspired by the [[Baker Street Irregulars]] from the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]], and perhaps by the [[Battle of Cable Street]], a riot started between [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]] and anti-fascist protesters in 1936. They are also known as The [[Unmentionables]] (a colloquial British term for underwear), possibly a parody of [[Irish National Invincibles|The Invincibles]], an Irish extremist nationalist group, or of [[The Untouchables (law enforcement)|The Untouchables]], a [[prohibition]]-era law-enforcement group, who served as government intelligence.\n* The \"Ward\", who acted as gate-guards, [[thief-taker]]s etc. during the day.\n* The \"Watch\", who served the same purpose in the hours of darkness. The force comprised one commander, five captains, ten sergeants, forty corporals, lance-corporals, constables and lance-constables, and, in times of emergency, a \"citizens militia\" of varied size.\n\nPublic opinion of the Watches (the Ward became known as the Day Watch) was never high, and reached an all-time low when a Commander, who had told the public not to take the law into their own hands, was thrown onto the Ankh with a cry of \"If it's not in our hands, whose hands is it in?\" The Guilds were policing themselves by this point, so the Watch was becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\nThe Watch had a brief respite in AM 1688, following the Ankh-Morpork Civil War, when Commander Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes and his Ironheads became the city's rulers. However, after he was deposed in favour of the [[Havelock Vetinari|Patricianship]], the Watch sank even further into obscurity; he was (until recently) the last Watch Commander. Under the rule of the Patricians, not only did Guild Law apply in the Guilds, but the only laws that applied anywhere else were the whims of the man in charge.\n\nBy the time of Homicidal Lord Winder's rule as Patrician, there were only a handful of Watch Houses remaining. The Cable Street Particulars were thriving, however, having changed from an [[intelligence agency]] into a [[secret police]] force, employing torture with gusto. During the [[Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May]], their building was burnt down by members of the Night Watch from Treacle Mine Road. The change in Patricians did not lead to an improvement in perceptions of the Watch, and when Lord Vetinari replaced [[Discworld characters#Lord Snapcase|Mad Lord Snapcase]], and even theft was legalised, there seemed to be no point to them at all.\n\nThe dysfunctional Night Watch now comprised three men, based in the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House. While the Day Watch had become another of the city's gangs, the Night Watch was just inactive.\n\n== History according to plot of novels ==\nThis changed when Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson joined, and the Night Watch saved the city from a [[European dragon|dragon]]. Following the destruction of their Watch House, they moved to larger premises in Pseudopolis Yard (a name reminiscent of [[Scotland Yard]]) and started recruiting more members, especially from ethnic minorities such as [[dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarfs]], [[troll (Discworld)|trolls]] and the undead. The Watch has even admitted a [[vampire]]. When they saved the Patrician's life Vetinari agreed to increase the force's stature, with new Section Houses being built around the city. The remains of the Day Watch were incorporated into a new City Watch, commanded by [[Sam Vimes]].\n\nSince then, the Watch has become a proper police force, dealing in crime prevention and investigation, rather than simple \"thief-taking\". They now have a [[forensics]] section, a Traffic Division and the long-gone Cable Street Particulars have been replaced by a plain-clothes division. A Watch Academy has been set up, although watchmen trained there often get \"poached\" by other [[Sto Plains]] city-states who have seen the advantages such a force has. Vimes tolerates this, because it is useful that coppers all over the plains have been trained to obey him.\n\nAnother recent addition are \"the [[Special Constabulary|Specials]]\", based on the Watch's ancient right to establish a Citizen's [[Militia]] as needed. Known members include the [[Librarian (Discworld)|Librarian]] (who was actually made a Special Constable long before the Militia was set up); Mr Boggis of the Thieves' Guild; Sam Vimes' butler Willikins; and a [[Technology of the Discworld#The clacks|clacks]] operative named Andy \"Two Swords\" Hancock who carries a disturbing amount of weaponry.\n\nThe Watch's current motto is \"''FABRICATI DIEM, PVNC''\", as inscribed on the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House; presumably the last part of the original \"''Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter''\" had been lost. This is nonsense in Latin, and doesn't actually mean \"[[Go ahead, make my day|Make my day]], punk\", although it looks as though it ought to; this is the nature of most \"[[Discworld (world)#Latatian|Latatian]]\" in the books, and is not unusual. Fred Colon insists it means \"To protect and serve\". The motto of the Vimes family is ''\"Protego et servio\"'', or \"I protect and serve\".\n\nMore and more watchmen trained by the City Watch prefer to work in other cities abroad where they can earn good money thanks to their outstanding qualification and ethics. They are referred to as \"Sammies\" (similar to \"Bobbies\", a term for British police officers derived from the common abbreviation of the first name of Sir Robert Peel, the man credited with the creation of the first regular, uniformed, police service in the UK) and communicate with each other by telegraph (\"clacks\"), a reference to real-world Interpol (mentioned in ''The Night Watch'').\n\n==Members==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ankh-Morpork City Watch.jpg|thumb|270px|The vigilant Ankh-Morpork City Watch in [[Guards! Guards!]]. From left to right: [[Nobby Nobbs]], [[Carrot Ironfoundersson]], [[Sam Vimes]] and [[Fred Colon]]. Second row: Dragon. Illustration by [[Paul Kidby]].]] -->\n\nThe primary members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are (see the linked articles for full details of the characters):\n\n===Commander Sir Samuel Vimes===\n{{Main|Sam Vimes}}\nSamuel Vimes is the Commander of the City Watch, it is all he has ever known and he now brings the dirty tricks he learned as a street copper to his new role.\nHe also makes sure to pass these tricks of the trade on to new recruits.\nUnder Sam Vimes, the Watch has strengthened its position, making many enemies (Although the Assassin's Guild no longer accept contracts). \nIn his time in the Watch he has married the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork, Lady Sybil, and had a son with her, young Sam.\n\n===Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson===\nAdopted by [[Dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarfs]] as an infant after the deaths of his human parents, Carrot grew up down in the mines of the Copperhead mountains. He is \"six feet tall and nearly as broad across the shoulders\". His dwarfish name is ''Kzad-bhat'', which, roughly translated, means \"Head Banger\", a logical nickname for a {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|adj=mid|-tall}} man living in a mine built by {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} dwarfs. He was quite surprised the day he was informed that he was human. His adoptive father thought that he ought to go and live amongst humans, and found him a job with the Ankh-Morpork Night Watch under the misapprehension that they were respected and respectable. Carrot was \"barely 16 years old\" at this time.\n\nCarrot joined the Night Watch while it was only a small group of misfits who ran from evildoers rather than arrest them (see ''[[Guards! Guards!]]''). He had difficulty with this attitude, as his \"old-fashioned\" view of justice led him to arrest the leader of the entirely legal Thieves' Guild on his first day. He since has learned to understand the city a bit better. The city learned about him as quickly when he won in a fight against every miscreant in the Mended Drum tavern, including the then doorman [[Sergeant Detritus|Detritus]] the troll.\n\nCaptain Carrot has made quite a name for himself, rapidly and effortlessly coming to know all of the city's one-million population by name and tax papers. He is big on paperwork and organization and always (often to the dismay of his girlfriend and fellow officer, [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]]) takes time to see all sides of a story before getting involved. When [[Sam Vimes]] planned to retire after his marriage to [[Lady Sybil Ramkin]], Carrot was named his successor. He is not particularly skilled in comma placement and has a bit of trouble with the whole concept of \"[[I before E except after C|i before e]]\". He is considered \"the Disc's most linear thinker\". For instance, as part of a murder investigation, [[Theatre of Cruelty (Discworld)|he interviews]] [[Death (Discworld)|Death]]. Carrot is also famous enough that there are [[action figure]]s of him available (as seen in the novel ''[[Hogfather]]'').\n\nCarrot's main talents are his genuine interest in and liking for people (particularly when contrasted with his boss and friend, [[Sam Vimes]] who \"doesn't like anybody\") and his charisma and \"supernatural likability\". He is often shown to be able to get people to do things no one else could force them to do, simply by assuming that they will; for example, he has great success in his outreach programs to at-risk Ankh-Morporkian youth by treating them like boy scouts. When he directly commands someone, they find it supremely difficult to disobey (even Vimes is shown on one occasion as being susceptible to this power). However, he prefers not to utilize this extreme of his power except in dire emergencies.\n\nCarrot is often thought of as non-threatening, which is a dangerous conclusion if you are the unlucky person who disappoints his honest nature. People think of Carrot as being simple, and the narrator will occasionally point out that this is true<ref>eg in Men at Arms</ref> - however, people often make the mistake of confusing \"simple\" with \"stupid\". Carrot's simplicity is his cunning. In ''[[Soul Music (novel)|Soul Music]]'', Carrot adds supplementary questions to the quiz machine in the Mended Drum, asking players who was responsible for recent crimes and frequently making arrests as a result. Carrot often sees the bright side of life. When Angua, a werewolf, tells him that her brother Andrei is stuck in wolf form and is forced to live as a champion sheepdog, Carrot notes that he ''is'' a champion. Carrot has also promised Angua that, should she ever follow in her brother Wolfgang's murderous footsteps, he will be the one to stop her.\n\nWhile it is common knowledge that Carrot is the true [[Heir apparent|heir to the throne]] of Ankh-Morpork, he doesn't acknowledge it, and has even hidden evidence of his royal heritage. The Patrician, [[Havelock Vetinari]], considers him useful for this reason as well as others, as it means that any attempt to start a [[revolution]] under the claim of being true heir is impossible, and that if anyone complains that only a king has the authority to do something he does, he can simply defer to Carrot.\n\nCarrot himself never uses his royal powers or acknowledges his royal heritage. After having learned about it (''[[Men at Arms]]''), he confides in Vetinari that he wants the people to obey the law because it's the law, not because \"Captain Carrot is good at being obeyed\", and that he is content with his job of ringing a bell and yelling that all's well \"provided of course that 'all is well'\".\n\nCarrot does, however on rare occasions, hint at his royal powers to make things happen. In ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', Lord Vetinari gives Sam Vimes the title of Duke, something only a King can do, while Carrot is present\u2014Vetinari goes so far as to say that he \"had been reminded\" that Vimes could have that title. In ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', when faced with the defection of most members of the Watch under Sergeant Fred Colon (then an Acting-Captain), Carrot puts his (plain and battered) royal sword on a desk in plain sight and reminds Watch members that they had taken an oath to the King, and that the King had not relieved them of it.\n\nCarrot is a stereotypical \"perfect\" policeman; totally honest, law abiding and determined to be friends with everyone. People of all species can't help wanting to behave well in his presence. He has an attitude of loving everyone. His philosophy of love for everyone has caused distress for Angua. She worries that his love toward her is equal to that he gives everyone else and not special. While he would place the welfare of the public above hers (and his own), when she was in danger he travelled to the rim of the Disc to save her.\n\nCarrot's attitude towards his relationship is considered particularly unusual. During ''Jingo'', Angua is kidnapped on a [[Klatch]]ian ship and the watch pursues them. Carrot does not stand at the front of the ship fraught with worry but, sensibly, gets some sleep so he will be ready to rescue her when they catch up. Although [[Sam Vimes]] and the ship's captain see the sense of this, they can't believe that someone in love could be so sensible.\n\nIn ''[[The Art of Discworld]]'' Pratchett says that Carrot has a bright future ahead of him, \"should Lord Vetinari not survive the next assassination attempt\". He also notes that, although most people envision Carrot as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], he is actually modeled after [[Liam Neeson]]. In both the ''[[Discworld (video game)|Discworld]]'' computer game and the [[BBC Radio]] production of ''[[Guards! Guards!]]'' he speaks with a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] accent. His character is also reminiscent of [[Constable]] [[Benton Fraser]] from ''[[Due South]]'' (who also has a [[wolf]] companion) but Carrot and Angua were an item before Due South was broadcast.\n\n===Captain Angua von \u00dcberwald===\nCaptain '''Delphine Angua von \u00dcberwald''' first appeared in ''[[Men at Arms]]''. Angua is a member of the [[Ankh-Morpork]] City Watch, originally hired as part of an [[affirmative action]] plan by [[Havelock Vetinari]]. Her physical beauty led colleagues to predict that criminals would be lining up to be arrested by her, but Angua's surprising strength and tough attitude soon made her one of the most feared officers on the Watch. Angua is a [[werewolf]], though she maintains a strict [[vegetarian]] diet during her human phase and only eats chickens during her wolf phase, for which she leaves discreet payments afterwards.  \n\nIn the 1999 computer game ''[[Discworld Noir]]'', and the 2001 books-on-tape version of ''Men at Arms'', her name is pronounced \"An-gyoo-uh\" with a hard \"g\". Terry Pratchett writes on the terrypratchettbooks.com forum: \"it's Ang as in Anger, u as in you, a as in a thing\".\n\nAngua comes from a family of werewolves. She is the daughter of a Baron and Baroness of [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]], and has two brothers, Wolfgang and Andrei. Her sister, Elsa, is deceased, killed by Wolfgang, who disguised it as an accident. Both Andrei and Elsa were \"Yennorks\", werewolves that are stuck in one form (Andrei always appeared to be a wolf, and Elsa a human). Angua and Wolfgang are the only children in their family with shape-shifting ability, known as \"bi-morphs\". Wolfgang is extremely violent and enjoys killing, even eating, \"inferior\" humans. Angua, partially in reaction to what Wolfgang did to their sister, rebels against the traditional werewolf lifestyle of her parents and brother and leaves \u00dcberwald. Andrei manages to slip away as well and enjoys a career as a talented sheep herder.\n\nAfter moving to Ankh-Morpork, Angua soon became the first woman to join the ranks of the City Watch. She met Corporal [[#Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson|Carrot Ironfoundersson]] in the Watch, and the two soon fell in love. Since recovering from his initial surprise (which involved drawing his sword), Carrot has not seemed bothered by the fact that Angua is a werewolf. However, Angua often worries that their different backgrounds and needs will eventually doom the relationship.\n\nOne of Angua's closest friends in the Watch is [[Dwarfs (Discworld)#Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom|Cheery Littlebottom]] the [[dwarfs (Discworld)|dwarf]]. In ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', Angua helps encourage Cheery to \"come out\" as a woman (dwarf society expects both male and female dwarves to behave in an indistinguishable way), even lending her dresses and make-up. At the same time, Angua conceals her true nature as a werewolf from Cheery because she knows her new friend hates and fears werewolves. Throughout the book Angua debates with herself over whether it would be best to just return to \u00dcberwald and live among other werewolves. In the end, she decides to stay in Ankh-Morpork.\n\nAngua has also made friends with Gaspode, a matty, hairy canine who gained and lost the talent of human speech in ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]''. He then regains it by the time of ''Men at Arms'' by sleeping too near the [[Unseen University|Unseen University's]] High-Energy Magic building. Gaspode flirts with Angua constantly and has helped her out on missions many times.\n\nIn ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', Watch Commander [[Sam Vimes]] is sent to \u00dcberwald on a diplomatic mission. Lord Vetinari chooses Angua to be a member of the Watch team that will accompany him, but Angua has already left for \u00dcberwald on business of her own. Carrot, assisted by Gaspode the dog, sets out after her. This is the first Discworld book to reveal much about Angua's background, and her parents and brother Wolfgang all figure in the story. Angua's relationship with actual wolves also provides much tension. Wolfgang plays a significant role as the leader of a violent werewolf movement in \u00dcberwald. Ultimately, Vimes kills Wolfgang in a violent confrontation in the city square. Angua is gratified to hear this, as Wolfgang threatened her and anything she cared for while he remained alive.\n\nThe fact that the Watch now has a werewolf has become common knowledge throughout Ankh-Morpork, but that hasn't affected Angua's privacy substantially, as, for obvious reasons, it is generally assumed to be [[#Corporal Nobby Nobbs|Nobby Nobbs]]; Carrot, Vimes, Vetinari and Angua herself all play along, mostly rather amused. However, in ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]'', it is revealed in passing that several members of the Ankh-Morpork aristocracy, as well as the lawyer Mr Slant, are well aware of her nature, and in ''[[Making Money]]'', [[Moist von Lipwig]] also figures this out upon seeing Angua in her werewolf form with Nobby standing beside her and recognizing her hair. Though the widespread recognition of the werewolf presence in the Watch has not inconvenienced Angua on a human level, it has led to a growing sophistication within the city's criminal underworld in evading capture. The first recorded use of a scent bomb is by The New Firm (Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip) in ''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]''. Several references to scent bombs have been made since, most notably their usage by Carcer, at the beginning of ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', when he killed Sergeant Stronginthearm.\n\nAngua assists Vimes in another diplomatic mission in ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', and is mentioned in ''[[Going Postal]]'' as being difficult for criminals in Ankh-Morpork to avoid. Angua also appears in a supporting role in ''[[Thud!]]'', where she gains a rival in the form of the Watch's first vampire officer, [[#Lance-Constable Salacia \"Sally\" von Humpeding|Sally]]. Angua is an extremely practical and level-headed person. While not as cynical as Commander [[Sam Vimes]], she balances out Carrot's na\u00efvet\u00e9 (although she occasionally wonders if he's really as innocent as he appears). In human form, Angua is a strict [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. In wolf form, she has a tendency to go after chickens, but she is always careful to go back and slip some money under the door the next day.\n\nThough she is deeply committed to Carrot, even likening herself to being his dog (or as she puts it in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', a wolf that lives with humans) it hasn't stopped others with romantic interest; there is tension with a wolf named Gavin in ''The Fifth Elephant'', and she receives a marriage proposal from the small mutt Mr. Fusspot in ''Making Money''.\n\nIn the events of ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]'' it is noted that Angua has been newly promoted to [[Police captain|Captain]]. Captain Carrot arrests Tiffany Aching after a disturbance in the King's Head involving the Nac Mac Feegles, who are defeated by [[Nac Mac Feegle|Wee Mad Arthur]], another Feegle (the rat catcher from Feet of Clay who rescues Sgt Colon from the King Golem, although he was referred to as a gnome in the original novel). Wee Mad Arthur has now joined the watch, and he tells Tiffany that she shall be escorted by his colleague, Captain Angua. Subsequent (\"main\" as opposed to young-adult) novels also refer to her by this rank.\n\nIn the 2010 Sky television adaptation of ''[[Terry Pratchett's Going Postal|Going Postal]]'', Angua was played by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]].\n\nThe [[Cretaceous]] [[gymnosperm]] species ''[[Czekanowskia anguae]]'' is named after Angua.<ref name=\"anguae\">Watson, J., Lydon, S. J. and Harrison, N. A. (2001).[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/36952440 \"A revision of the English Wealden Flora, III: Czekanowskiales, Ginkgoales & allied Coniferales\"]. Bulletin of the Natural History Museum (Geology Series), 57(1), 29-82.</ref>\n\n===Sergeant Fred Colon===\n'''Frederick \"Fred\" Colon''' is a [[sergeant]], and appears to have been so for a long time. May have been first mentioned in ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'' as \"a Sergeant of The Watch\" who enters the then Broken Drum. He is described on several occasions as \"one of nature's sergeants\". He is overweight, preferring to avoid trouble and exertion, and rather unimaginative. When not on desk duty (a post he gets more often than other sergeants, due to being responsible for working out the rota), he generally \"guards\" bridges or large buildings against theft. He was a [[corporal]] in the Watch at the time [[Sam Vimes]] first joined, and subsequent to this spent some time in the army (the Duke of [[Quirm]]'s Middleweight [[Infantry]] and then the Duke of Eorle's First Heavy Infantry), before returning to the Watch.\n\nIn ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', Colon became the head of the Traffic Squad, which also included his best friend [[#Corporal Nobby Nobbs|Nobby Nobbs]]. This role perfectly fit the above described qualities, especially as the Traffic Squad is \"self-financing\" (i.e. they keep the fines). A brief promotion to acting-captain proved a disaster as everyone, including Colon himself, expected. He is currently holding dual position of Custody Officer and Watch Liaison Officer; jobs so vague that no one is entirely sure what they entail, least of all Colon himself; they serve the dual purpose of preventing his brain from becoming overburdened with responsibility and avoiding the catastrophic possibility that he might be given a task of any real importance. His office, in a separate building from the main watch house, is frequented by old acquaintances who want somewhere quiet to get away from the wife, hear what's happening on the street and\u2014in Vimes' words\u2014\"gossip like washerwomen.\" For this free-flowing source of information, Vimes considers the cost of doughnuts on an expense voucher a very favourable trade.\n\nCloser examination, though, shows that Colon has some hidden depths. As Vimes thought it, most of the other watch officers saw a fat, stupid, lazy, cowardly man and that was mostly what was there, but Colon and Nobby have a street-level knowledge of Ankh-Morpork on a par with Vimes and are good at sensing tension in a crowd. Both are also survivors of the Glorious 25 May when, as described in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', in the aftermath of a coup an assortment of regular police and hangers-on (including an apprentice Assassin called [[Vetinari]]) took out, at some cost, the hard-line remnants of the outgoing regime's secret police. Colon also performs his duties in ''[[Thud!]]'' fairly well. He is an amiable jailer, and bright enough to keep the keys in a closed tin box in the bottom drawer of his desk, well out of reach of anything an inmate would be able to use. He is often portrayed as being prejudiced against \"minority \", even in the Watch, such as dwarves, undead, \"foreigners\", or even women. However, his prejudice is so non-specific and naive (and frequently short-lived when actually exposed to the group in question) that nobody takes it seriously.\n\nHe is possibly related to Sergeant Doppelpunkt (German for \"colon\", as in the punctuation mark), one half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]], seen in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]''. Other [[Discworld characters]] with a notable similarity to Colon include a member of the guard in the \u00dcberwald town of Bonk (who was nicknamed \"Colonesque\" by Samuel Vimes) and one of the market guards in Al Khali, [[Klatch]]. Like the various [[Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler|Dibblers]], this may be due to [[morphic resonance]].\n\nColon is married, though his wife works during the day; since he works at night, the two seldom see each other and instead communicate by leaving notes. Vimes even goes as far as to privately attribute the longevity of Fred's marriage to this fact. In ''Guards! Guards!'' it is noted they have a number of children, a fact which Vimes puts down to 'persuasive handwriting'.\n\nColon made a brief appearance in the [[Cosgrove Hall]] adaptation of ''[[Soul Music]]''. In the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of ''Guards! Guards!'' he was voiced by [[Stephen Thorne]]. In the 1988 stage play he was played by Roger Bingham. In the Radio 4 adaptation of ''Night Watch'' he was voiced by [[Sam Dale]].\n\n===Corporal Nobby Nobbs===\n'''Cecil Wormsborough St. John \"Nobby\" Nobbs''' is untidy, smelly, and about the same height as a dwarf. Because of this and the fact that he is extremely ugly, he carries a certificate signed by the [[Havelock Vetinari|Patrician]] to prove that, on the [[testimony]] of his [[parent]]s and the [[midwife]] who delivered him, he is probably a human being.  A running joke is the inability of others to believe this, despite&mdash;or even because of&mdash;the evidence. In fact, in ''Hogfather'', even [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] himself was unable to discern Nobby's species. According to the blurb of ''[[Men At Arms]]'', Nobby was \"disqualified from the human race for shoving\". He always seems to have a [[Cigarette litter|cigarette butt]] about him, normally stowed behind his ear.\n\nSamuel Vimes is Nobby's commanding officer, and Sergeant Fred Colon his partner and longtime friend. Together, Nobby and Colon have managed to have many strangely philosophical (or just strange) conversations, including one on whether [[Death (Discworld)|Death]] has a first name, or even any friends to call him it. Oddly enough, these conversations hint at Nobby being more intelligent than Colon, with Nobby continually pointing out fatal flaws in Colon's statements and arguments, and Colon mentally scrambling to come up with an answer (this is not unlike some of the byplay in the [[Laurel and Hardy]] films). Nobby is fond of [[folk dancing]].\n\nAs a child he was a [[street urchin]] and a major source of information for various city notables. His father was abusive, and broke his leg at least once (Vimes notes in ''Night Watch'' that Nobby used to have his arms broken by his father too\u2014and in ''Hogfather'', Nobby claims that he never got anything in his stocking ... except once, when his father vomited into it). The young Nobby sometimes refers to his father as \"Number One Suspect\", and is afraid of going to prison because his father is currently in there. He was apparently inspired to join the Watch after meeting with [[Sam Vimes|Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel]] (or alternatively Sam Vimes, due to time travel), who once gave him a spoon (which his father subsequently stole upon being released from prison).\n\nNobby was once thought to be the [[Earl]] of Ankh, but it was all a charade to make him [[king]] as he would be easier to manipulate than the 'real' heir in the form of [[#Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson|Captain Carrot]]. Nobby proved less tractable than the conspirators had expected, turning down a cushy life as [[figurehead]] ruler of Ankh-Morpork largely, by his own account, for fear of what Vimes would have to say&mdash;or more importantly, ''do''&mdash;when he found out given his and his infamous ancestor's opinions on royalty. It was also due to his family's long-standing belief that they should never [[Volunteering|volunteer]] for anything as there is always going to be a catch. Indeed, he fled the offer at a dead run, all the time terrified Vimes would \"[[Rage (emotion)|go spare]]\". However, at the end of the book ''Feet of Clay'', it is also suggested that he may be a real [[nobleman]], due to the amount of family heirlooms he has not mentioned to any other person. On the other hand, the Nobbses have stolen so much stuff over the years that, as Vimes has said, \"you could probably prove Nobby was the [[Dowager]] [[Duchess]] of [[Quirm]]\".\n\nNobby played a role in the resolution of the \"[[war]]\" between [[Ankh-Morpork]] and the empire of [[Klatch]] in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', and in recognition the Patrician gave him a new job in traffic control. He has since been \"promoted\" to assistant to the Watch Liaison Officer (in other words Fred Colon), a job vague enough to ensure he never has to do anything actually important.\n\nIronically it is also Nobby who ends the war between the dwarves and the trolls. In Thud it is revealed that the Battle of Koom Valley, the main reason for the continuing hatred between those two races, was not supposed to be a war at all but a chance for the Kings of each side to discuss peace. This information is contained in an ancient artifact called a Cube. Nobby, who has been set up as a petty thief from the start, finds and steals the Cube at some point in the book, although we do not find this out until Vimes tells him to hand it over. Vimes works out how to make the Cube play its message, in the presence of the current King of the Dwarves, and the truth of Koom Valley is heard for the first time in hundreds of years.\n\nHe believes he is in a romantic relationship with Verity \"[[Hammerhead shark|Hammerhead]]\" Pushpram, a girl who runs a fish stall and gets her nickname from the fact that her eyes appear to be looking in opposite directions. However, this \"[[Intimate relationship|relationship]]\" seems to consist solely of her hitting him with a fish and telling him to bugger off. He remains \"faithful\" to her, however, in all books except ''[[Thud!]]'', in which he is temporarily in a relationship with exotic dancer [[Discworld characters#Tawneee|Tawneee]]. As of the events of ''Snuff'', he appears to be in a romantic relationship with Shine of the Rainbow, a goblin girl, and it is tacitly suggested that Nobby may have some Goblin in his ancestry, explaining why nobody could be sure of his humanity. This relationship is confirmed in \"[[Raising Steam]]\", when Colon refers to Nobby being \"practically married\", in reference to his own marital arguments with Mrs Colon.\n\nHe is possibly related to Corporal Knopf (as Knopf can be translated as knob), one half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]], seen in ''[[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents]]''. Other ''Discworld'' characters with a notable similarity to Nobby include a member of the guard in the \u00dcberwald town of Bonk, who was nicknamed \"Nobbski\" by Vimes, and one of the market guards in Al Khali, [[Klatch]]. Like the various [[Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler|Dibblers]], this may be due to morphic resonance. Despite this, being related to Nobby is not seen as a good thing in Ankh Morpork. One of the Unseen University bedlows who, by sheer [[coincidence]], shared the same last name as Nobby was incredibly swift to denounce any potential ties of family.\n\nAccording to the ''Pratchett Portfolio'', his typical saying is \"'tis a lie sir, I never done it\" (like all other \"typical sayings\" in the Portfolio (except that of the Death of Rats) he has not actually been recorded saying it).\n\nDuring Nobby's time in Klatch he \"got in touch with his feminine side\", and is quite fond of wearing women's clothing. This can occasionally be useful, as he dressed up as an old lady as part of a [[Traffic stop|Traffic scam]] before being stopped by Vimes.\n\nNobby made a brief appearance in the [[Cosgrove Hall]] adaptation of ''[[Soul Music]]''. In the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of ''Guards! Guards!'' he was voiced by [[Melvyn Hayes]]. In the 1988 stageplay he was played by David Brett, formerly of the [[Flying Pickets]]. Nobby has also appeared in two computer adventure games, ''[[Discworld (computer game)|Discworld (The Trouble With Dragons)]]'' (where he was voiced by [[Tony Robinson]]) and ''[[Discworld Noir]]'' (where he was voiced by [[Rob Brydon]]). In both cases Nobby had a distinct Irish accent. In the 2006 TV adaptation of ''[[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather|Hogfather]]'' he was played by [[Nicolas Tennant]].\n\n===Sergeant Detritus===\n''See [[Detritus (Discworld)|Trolls (Discworld)]]''\n\n===Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom===\n''See [[Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom|Dwarfs (Discworld)]]''\n\n===Constable Reginald Shoe===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of Discworld characters]] -->\n''See: Undead (Discworld)''\n\n===Lance-Constable Salacia \"Sally\" von Humpeding===\n''See Undead (Discworld)''\n\n===Constable Dorfl===\n''See: [[Dorfl|Golems (Discworld)]]''\n\n\n===Constable Visit-the-Infidel/Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets{{anchor|Constable_Visit}}===\n'''Visit-the-Infidel-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets''' (sometimes referred to as Visit-the-Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets) is a [[Constable]] of the City Watch. He is generally just called \"Constable Visit\", or occasionally by his nickname \"Washpot\". The term comes from one of Visit's favourite quotations, \"Moab is my washpot. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe\", from Psalm&nbsp;60 in ''The Book of Om''. His name is, apparently, shorter in Omnian.\n\nHe first appeared in ''Feet of Clay''. He is referred to by Pratchett as follows: \"There's one in every station, and Constable Visit was enough for two.\" Samuel Vimes says he is a good copper, his highest form of personal praise. He is an Omnian of a gentle but determined [[Proselytism|proselytising]] nature. He can clear a large crowd in seconds, just by talking to them about [[religion]] and threatening them with [[pamphlet]]s, principally ''Unadorned Facts'' and ''Battle Call'' (parodies of ''[[The Plain Truth]]'' and ''[[The War Cry]]'').\n\nIn off-duty moments he goes door to door with his fellow Omnian, Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments. Entire pubs have been known to draw the curtains, turn off the lights and lie on the floor whimpering at news of his coming down the street. The only \"entity\" not afraid of Visit's endless proselytising is his friend and fellow constable Dorfl, a golem with endless patience and a desire to argue faith rationally.\n\nHe appears in the SkyOne television adaptation of ''[[Hogfather]]'', portrayed by [[Richard Katz (actor)|Richard Katz]].\n\n===Inspector A E Pessimal===\n'''A E Pessimal''' was first the government Inspector of the Watch assigned (in ''[[Thud!]]'') by [[Lord Vetinari]] to inspect the Watch and judge whether the Watch gave [[fair value]] for the [[wikt:civic|civic]] [[funding|funds]] it used (\"[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?|who watches the watchmen?]]\") and to inspect the Unseen University in ''[[A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices]]''.\n\nHe is described as a neat little man, with very shiny shoes, and has no friends and no sense of humour. He does not have a first name, as others would understand; he was \"initialled\" at birth rather than named.<ref group=\"note\">Using a single letter (not really an \"initial\" since it's the only letter, not the first) as a name is not actually rare. Famous people with single-letter names include the former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[List of light-heavyweight boxing champions|Light Heavyweight World Champion]] boxer [[J. B. Williamson]], and the late US President Harry S Truman.</ref>\nHe was in a position to seriously inconvenience Vimes with difficult questions such as; \"Why is C.W.St.J. 'Nobby' Nobbs in the Watch? Are you aware you employ a petty criminal?\"\n\nEventually, Vimes decided to shake the man up, and swore him in as a [[special constable]] for the duration of an impending street fight of roughly a thousand trolls and dwarves. Vimes thought he could scare the man while showing him what it was like to be a copper. Instead, A E took his position seriously, to the point of bare-handedly attacking and trying to bite a troll who took a swing at Vimes. This action remains one of the few events to have totally shocked Vetinari, when he heard about it in Vimes' report (\"''Mr Pessimal?'' Mr. A E ''Pessimal''? We are talking about the same person? Small man, very clean shoes?\").\n\nA short while later, A E came to Vimes' office and was offered the position of Lance-Constable and [[adjutant]], with an estimate that he could be a [[Sergeant]] in a year. Vimes' reason for taking A E on was A E's patience and intelligence; Vimes needed someone who could look through paperwork and understand what was being said by sifting out important or suspicious facts. Vimes reasons that A E always wanted to be a Watchman and was stopped by his weak stature. As a condition of his employment, A E was told that he would go on patrol twice a week, so he would be able to learn what's important. A E is also one of the few people Vimes allows to call him \"Mister Vimes\", saying that the man \"earned it all in one go\". Along with Vimes' Dis-Organizer Mark Five (\"[[BlackBerry|The Gooseberry]]\"), it would seem that A E is the start to a [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|new department]] in the City Watch.\n\nBy the events of ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', A E has risen to the newly minted [[Police rank|rank]] of [[Inspector]] in the City Watch, and his [[forensic accounting]] has become legendary and feared throughout Ankh-Morpork, as people fear what he may uncover in their financial records.\n\n===Constable Igor===\n'''Igor''' is an [[Igor (Discworld)|Igor]] who was considered \"too modern\" for [[\u00dcberwald (Discworld)|\u00dcberwald]] by his family, and went with Samuel Vimes to Ankh-Morpork. He specialises in [[genetics|genetic]] experiments (\"bio-artificing\"), which, on the Discworld, involves really small stitches. His creations include a pet rabbit called Eerie, a particularly suitable name as he grows spare human ears on it (a reference to the human ear equipped mouse of 1995, a few years prior to the creation of the book). Another early experiment was breeding noses, which act as independent lifeforms until sewn on. He also experimented with swimming potatoes in the hopes of breeding instant Fish & Chips. As with all Igors, Constable Igor is highly talented at performing transplant surgery.\n\nHe has a speech \"impediment\" in that he sometimes forgets to lisp. Vimes employs him because of his surgery methods, which Vimes considered to be considerably more advanced than most of Ankh-Morpork's doctors. Igor first appeared in the novel ''The Fifth Elephant''.\n\n===Constable Downspout===\nConstable '''Downspout''', who first appears in ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'', is a [[surveillance]] expert for the Watch. Being a [[Troll (Discworld)#Other kinds of troll|gargoyle]], he is capable of remaining motionless in one spot and watching for days at a time, a \"world champion at not moving\" as Vimes once put it. He has no use for money and instead receives his salary in [[Columbidae|pigeon]]s, which he eats.\n\n===Corporal Buggy Swires===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of Discworld characters]] -->\nA [[Gnomes (Discworld)|gnome]]. Introduced in ''Jingo'' (possibly in ''[[The Light Fantastic]]''; there was a gnome identified only as Swires), Buggy possesses the hard-nosed, bellicose personality typical of his species, proving able to shout down uncooperative witnesses despite being only six inches tall. He has since established himself as the sole member of the Watch's Airborne Section through his ability to tame various species of bird (most recently a [[buzzard]], acquired from the pictsies for a crate of whisky) to act as transport, for reconnaissance and messaging purposes.\n\n===Minor Watchmen===\n\n====Special-Constable Andy \"Two Swords\" Hancock====\nMentioned only in ''Thud!'', Andy Hancock is one of the \"Specials\", a group of militia men trained by Sergeant Colon. He is described as being an \"amiable man with an amiable smile\". He fights with two curved [[Agatean Empire|Agatean]] swords and [[nunchaku]], which he calls \"Agatean numknuts\" (a reference to \"numchuks\" a common term for the nunchaku in the United States, and a common accident occurring with their untrained use, as well as to the slang insult \"numbnuts\" meaning \"idiot\"). He is probably either an extremely competent fighter, or just a wild ninja wannabe. It is stated that he destroyed three practice dummies in thirty minutes. When not practicing, Hancock works for the \"Grand Trunk\" clacks company, supplying the Watch with information.\n\n====Sergeant Stronginthearm====\nDwarf desk sergeant, appearing in ''The Fifth Elephant'' and killed just prior to the beginning of ''Night Watch'' by the serial killer known as [[Carcer Dun]].\n\n====Acting-Constable Cuddy====\nIntroduced in ''Men at Arms''. The first dwarf recruit who put aside his differences with trolls and became a good friend to [[Sergeant Detritus|Detritus]]. Killed by Dr. Cruces towards the end of the story. There are overt hints that Carrot may have buried the \"[[Hand cannon|gonne]]\" of the story, as well as the book containing the royal lineage, in Cuddy's coffin to keep it safe (and to give Cuddy a good weapon for the afterlife). He also created the special cooling helmet for [[Sergeant Detritus|Detritus]].\n\n====Constables Flint and Morraine====\nTwo troll watchmen. Introduced in ''Men at Arms'' but only have very minor roles. They were the first two non-watchmen \"sworn in\" (conscripted) into the Carrot's \"Citizen's Militia\" by Detritus, using a special [[Threat|troll oath]] (\"I will do what I told, otherwise I get my goohuloog head kicked in.\"). It is unclear however if these two trolls bear any resemblance to the two trolls, Flint and Morry, in ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]''.\n\nFlint was briefly elevated to sergeant under the tenure of Acting-Captain Fred Colon (promoted to run the watch during the temporary resignations of Carrot and Angua while Vimes, Littlebottom and Detritus were serving as ambassadors to Uberwald in ''The Fifth Elephant''), much to the annoyance of Nobby Nobbs, who had been obviously gunning for the promotion himself.\n\n====Lance-Constable Bluejohn====\nThe Watch's largest Troll officer, Bluejohn is a gentle and retiring troll. He is so big that he is used as the riot shield for the rest of the Watch officers and he is often used during crowd control. This is because, wherever he is sent, he ''is'' the crowd. His name is taken from a type of [[fluorite]] found in [[Derbyshire]], England.\n\n====Corporal Ping====\nIntroduced in ''The Fifth Elephant'', he has a knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. In the midst of a murder investigation, he takes a moment to inform Commander Sir Samuel Vimes that \"ping\" is a dialect word, meaning [[Water-meadow|watermeadow]]. He also appears in ''Night Watch''.\n\n====Andre====\nA plain-clothes watchman of the reformed Cable Street Particulars, working in the Ankh-Morpork Opera House during ''[[Maskerade]]''. Has not been seen or mentioned since, except indirectly in ''Feet of Clay'', when Carrot writes to his parents that there are now \"secret policemen\".\n\n====Constable Wee Mad Arthur====\nSworn in by Fred Colon during the events of ''Feet of Clay''. He was made a special Watchman for that night. His species is never explicitly stated before the novel, ''[[I Shall Wear Midnight]]'', though Detritus refers to him as a \"''ger-nome''\". During a fight in the [[Pub|King's Head]], in ''I Shall Wear Midnight'', he fights off about thirty members of the Feegle clan from the Chalk, before returning to the Chalk to discover that he is, in fact, a [[Nac Mac Feegle|Feegle]] foundling who was raised by gnomes, much in the same way Carrot was raised by dwarves. He is noted to, like [[#Corporal Buggy Swires|Buggy Swires]] and other Nac Mac Feegle, have human strength in a six-inch body. After returning from [[leave (military)|leave]] in the Chalk, he was instrumental in uncovering the [[Slavery|enslavement]] of [[Mouldavia|Goblins]], exercising the use of his newly learned \"Crawstep\" technique from his time with the Chalk [[Nac Mac Feegle]] clan.\n\n====The Librarian====\n{{Main|Librarian (Discworld)}}\n\nThe librarian of the [[Unseen University]] is a sentient Orangutan (formerly a human, before being magically transformed, who now communicates using only the word \"Ook!\")<ref>{{cite news|title=Book Review: Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Unseen-Academicals-by-Terry-Pratchett-884571.php|accessdate=18 September 2012|last=Bancells|first=Chris|date=26 April 2011|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}</ref> who is one of the Discworld's most frequently recurring characters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview: Terry Pratchett - author|url=http://www.abc.net.au/abc3/articles/s2515692.htm|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=13 March 2009|work=[[ABC3]]}}</ref> Given a badge during the events of ''[[Guards!

The only description of him in this appearance was that he was \"definitely human\", as opposed to the \"probably human\" Nobbs. He is known by the nickname \"Kipper\" by his fellow Watchmen, and Sam Vimes is comfortable enough with him to openly use the name. He later accompanied Commander Vimes on his trip to the dwarves' mine, but was sent away before reaching it with a message for Lady Sybil. During his off-nights, he works security shifts at the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork, where he appeared in ''[[Making Money]]'' apprehending whom he thought to be a would-be robber (actually [[Moist von Lipwig]]) in the vault.\n\nHis next appearance was in ''[[Unseen Academicals]]'', where he found two of the main characters, Trevor Likely and Mr. Nutt, in need of assistance after a football riot spilled over into a gang fight.\n\nIn ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', Haddock is part of a diplomatic exchange programme with the City State of Quirm; Here, he is serving with the city watch at the rank of Acting-Captain; it is unclear if this is a reflection of Haddock's abilities per se, the esteem in which the Ankh-Morpork City Watch \"Sammies\" are held, or simply a function of the exchange programme itself. During these events, Commander Vimes promises his awaited promotion to Sergeant if he can complete a vital task (finding bacon sandwiches at short notice, with the right kind of sauce). Haddock does so, and Vimes signs his promotion on the spot. After this point, Kipper Haddock's location and current duties are unknown.\n\n====Lewton====\nLewton appears in the third Discworld computer game, ''[[Discworld Noir]]''. Lewton is the Disc's first and only [[private investigator]] and a former member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, having been banished from it for taking a [[bribe]].\n\nLewton was once a member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (sometime before the books). Commander [[Sam Vimes]] had a particular unexplained grudge against him. Lewton met and fell in love with a female [[archaeologist]] named Ilsa and seemed to have a happy life; a particular moment fondly remembered was the Hotel Pseudopolis. Life seemed to be going well for Lewton. However, one day, Ilsa left Ankh-Morpork for unexplained reasons and this drew Lewton into a [[clinical depression|depression]]. He spent countless days drinking and drinking. During these hard times, Lewton took a bribe which ended in him being permanently excluded from the Watch. A few years later, Lewton decided to pick himself up, forget about Ilsa and the rest of his past and start a new life. He became a Private Investigator. However, he rarely got any cases.\n\nWhen Carlotta Von Uberwald came into his life, Lewton's life changed forever. She gave him the Mundy Case and although Lewton didn't know it, she used him as a puppet in order to find Mundy (of whom she said was her lover but he was really an informant for her cult). After discovering this they argued, and during this argument Carlotta kissed and bit Lewton, turning him into a werewolf (or some variant type, several of which are named or referenced in the books themselves). Using his new wolf abilities, Lewton managed to put a stop to Carlotta's cult's plans and save Ankh-Morpork from being consumed by a giant \"god of destruction\".\n\nWhile he was working on the Mundy Case, Ilsa came back to his life and it looked like they were going get back together, but much like with Casablanca's ending, at the end of the game Lewton watches her fly away in the Disc's first airplane.\n\n===Former Members===\n\n====Findthee Swing====\nCaptain Swing is the head of the [[#Cable Street Particulars|Unmentionables]] in the [[Ankh-Morpork]] of the past in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]''. Swing is mainly remembered for his attempt to control crime by ordering all weapons confiscated, reasoning that this would result in a decline in crime figures, failing to acknowledge that criminals don't obey the law in the first place and would actually greatly enjoy the lack of weapons in society.\n\nHe is described as a thin, balding man dressed in a long, old-fashioned black coat with large pockets, and supports himself on an opera cane (which is in reality a [[swordstick]]). Swing moves and speaks in an erratic, jumpy fashion, in bursts, and sputters rather than a continuous flow of movement or sound. He is, however, a skilled [[swordsman]], as he does not resort to flashy [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]], but instead actually attacks his opponent.\n\nSwing always carries with him a large set of calipers and a steel ruler, with which he measures the facial characteristics of people he meets in order to determine their personal traits ([[phrenology]]). Its reliability is questionable; according to it, Vimes has the eye of a mass murderer (Vimes says he indeed does ... in his other suit), while Carcer's only problem was his environment (most likely all the dead bodies wherever he went).\n\nHe is killed by Vimes during the fire at the Unmentionables' headquarters. On arriving at the Great Desert he tries to use his phrenological skills to determine Death's character, only to find that Death has no characteristics he can measure.\n\nThe name [[Captain Swing]] has long been associated with civil unrest, being the pseudonym of the (possibly mythical) leader of the [[Swing Riots]].\n\n==== Mayonnaise Quirke and The Day Watch ====\nBefore the merging of the Watches, the Day Watch dealt with all crimes committed during daylight. The only significant Day Watch member mentioned is its captain, \"[[Mayonnaise]]\" Quirke, who first appears in ''Men at Arms''. Quirke is nicknamed \"Mayonnaise\" by the Night Watch as he is rich, thick, oily, and smells faintly of eggs. In ''Night Watch'' he is revealed to be a little bit older than Vimes. He was originally a [[Corporal]] in the Night Watch before kicked out by [[Serjeant-at-Arms|Sergeant-at-Arms]] John Keel (actually Vimes). He joined the Day Watch shortly afterwards and presumably rose to the rank of [[Police captain|captain]] at the same time as Vimes did. During the events of ''Men at Arms'', he is knocked out by Carrot, who tells his men to leave the city; presumably, Quirke left with them.\n\n==Allies==\n\n===71-Hour Ahmed===\nA Klatchian warrior who accompanies the Klatchian envoy Prince Khufurah on a diplomatic journey to Ankh-Morpork in the novel ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]''. He speaks with a heavy accent and has a penchant for chewing on cloves. Following an attempt on the prince's life by an unknown assassin, he is suspected of killing the Watch's prime suspect, provoking Vimes and other Watch members to pursue him back to Klatch (Particularly after he captures [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch#Captain Angua von .C3.9Cberwald|Angua]] in werewolf form).\n\nApart from belonging to a vicious but honorable warrior clan known as the [[#D'regs|D'reg]]s, he is later revealed to be the [[Wali|Wali of Klatch]], a Klatchian equivalent of a watchman on a par with Vimes (Wali is both a play on the British term \"Wally\", meaning a simpleton or halfwit and an Arabic word equivalent to \"magistrate\"). It also turns out his obsessive clove-chewing and broken Morporkian are in fact a disguise meant to delude foreigners into falsely assuming he is nothing but an uncivilized barbarian. Like many privileged foreigners, he was sent to the Assassins' Guild as a child on the assumption that he would get an excellent education. He confounds Vimes by his fond memories of Ankh-Morpork, and even [[Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler]]. He and Vimes eventually develop a wary respect for each other, mostly based on both of them being basically honest cops in unenviable positions.\n\nHe got his nickname after killing a man (guilty of poisoning a well, and killing a number of villagers and very valuable camels) one hour before the end of the traditional D'reg three days of hospitality, during which even your greatest enemy should be shown respect.\n\n===Willikins===\nButler to [[Sam Vimes|Commander Vimes]] and [[Lady Sybil Vimes|Lady Sibyl]], Willikins was in his youth a member of the Shamlegger Street Rude Boys street gang (whose skills at street violence were respected even by Sam Vimes) where his weapon of choice was [[Oddjob|a cap brim sewn with sharpened pennies]]. In ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'' it is revealed that he has been in the service of the Ramkin family for most of his life. His only absence from this employment was during the events in ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'' when he joined the army during the war against Klatch, during which he was known to alternate between violently yelling at his men for showing disrespect and then politely apologising to Vimes for their actions. It is implied, and almost certainly true, that he bit a man's nose off during the same war.  At some point in his life (almost certainly prior to entering service with the Ramkins), Willikins spent some time in the Tanty (prison), as he explains in ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]''.  Willikins' exaggerated deference and circumlocutory manner of speech strongly echo the character [[Jeeves]] created by [[P G Wodehouse]].\n\nHe has proven himself more than once to be a skilled and ruthless fighter as well as a dutiful butler\u2014sometimes simultaneously: during the events of ''[[Thud!]]'', Willikins is surprised by a Deep-Down Dwarf carrying a flamethrower entering the house illegally, and is \"forced to defend (himself) with the first thing that came to hand\", the 18-inch long sharp serrated-steel ice knife; he also lodged another dwarf on a meathook. It is also revealed in ''Thud!'' that Willikins is a member of the \"Specials\"\u2014The Ankh-Morpork City Militia. However, during the events of ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'', Willikins goes to great lengths to avoid being involved with the local version of the Watch, claiming it went against his personal grain to be associated with the forces of Law and Order.\n\n===John \"Mossy\" Lawn===\nA doctor in Ankh-Morpork. He first appeared in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', as a backstreet \"pox doctor\", offering medical assistance to \"seamstresses\". He had trained in [[Klatch]], where he had learnt techniques other Morporkian surgeons distrusted, but which kept patients alive for longer than it took to pay the bill. He also gave free treatment to those who needed it, including those who had been tortured by the Cable Street Particulars. He is quiet, if a tad sarcastic, and almost unshockable.

''Cheng'' means a city.<ref name=\"Yu 18\" />\n\nToday, the site is most commonly known in Chinese as ''G\u00f9g\u014dng'' ({{linktext|\u6545|\u5bab}}), which means the \"Former Palace\".<ref>\"G\u00f9g\u014dng\" in a generic sense also refers to all former palaces, another prominent example being the former Imperial Palaces ([[Mukden Palace]]) in [[Shenyang]]; see [[Gugong (disambiguation)]].</ref> The museum which is based in these buildings is known as the \"Palace Museum\" ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u6545|\u5bab|\u535a|\u7269|\u9662}}|p=G\u00f9g\u014dng B\u00f3w\u00f9y\u00f9an}}).\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Forbidden City}}\n<!--This section is a summary of the main article at [[History of the Forbidden City]].

The [[#Inner Court|Inner Court]] ({{linktext|\u5185|\u5ef7}}) or Back Palace ({{linktext|\u540e|\u5bab}}) includes the northern sections, and was the residence of the Emperor and his family, and was used for day-to-day affairs of state. (The approximate dividing line shown as red dash in the plan above.) Generally, the Forbidden City has three vertical axes. The most important buildings are situated on the central north\u2013south axis.<ref name=\"Yu 25\" />\n\nEntering from the Meridian Gate, one encounters a large square, pierced by the meandering Inner Golden Water River, which is crossed by five bridges. Beyond the square stands the [[Gate of Supreme Harmony]] (F). Behind that is the Hall of Supreme Harmony Square.<ref name=\"Yu 49\" /> A three-tiered white marble terrace rises from this square. Three halls stand on top of this terrace, the focus of the palace complex. From the south, these are the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]] ({{linktext|\u592a|\u548c|\u6bbf}}), the [[Hall of Central Harmony]] ({{linktext|\u4e2d|\u548c|\u6bbf}}), and the [[Hall of Preserving Harmony]] ({{linktext|\u4fdd|\u548c|\u6bbf}}).<ref name=\"Yu 48\">p. 48, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nThe Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, and rises some {{convert|30|m|ft}} above the level of the surrounding square.

The Emperor, representing [[Yin and Yang|Yang]] and the Heavens, would occupy the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Empress, representing [[Yin and Yang|Yin]] and the Earth, would occupy the Palace of Earthly Tranquility.

It is connected to the [[Gate of Heavenly Purity]] to its south by a raised walkway. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Emperor. However, beginning from the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], the Emperor lived instead at the smaller [[Hall of Mental Cultivation]] (N) to the west, out of respect to the memory of the [[Kangxi Emperor]].<ref name=\"CCTV2\" /> The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor's audience hall.<ref name=\"Yu 78\">p. 78, Yu (1984)</ref> A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon.

In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Empress. In the Qing dynasty, large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers. From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, the Empress moved out of the Palace. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor's wedding night.<ref name=\"Yu 80-83\">pp. 80\u201383, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nBetween these two palaces is the [[Hall of Union]], which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof.

The Palaces lay to the West and to the East of the three main Palaces of the Inner Court, hence the names. There were six Western Palaces and six Eastern Palaces. \nA consort with the rank of concubine and above was allocated her own Palace and was named the manage of that Palace, an honor in itself. Lower ranking consorts (Noble Ladies and below) lived in separate chambers in the Palaces of the higher ranking consorts. Thus many of the Qing emperors were born and grew up in the Palaces.[60] During the late Qing era, Empress Dowager Cixi resided in one of the Western Palaces and became known as the \"Western empress\". Her co-regent Empress Dowager Ci'an lived in one of the Eastern Palaces and was thus known as the \u201cEastern empress\u201d.

Similar designs can be found throughout the Imperial City.]]\n\nReligion was an important part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese [[Taoism|Taoist]] religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.<ref name=\"Yu 176\">p. 176, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nAnother prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was [[Buddhism]]. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings.<ref name=\"Yu 177\">p. 177, Yu (1984)</ref> Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and [[mandala]]s, placed in ritualistic arrangements.<ref name=\"Yu 189-193\">pp. 189\u2013193, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n{{See also|Imperial City (Beijing)}}\n\n[[File:Beijing city wall map vectorized.svg|thumb|left|Location of the Forbidden City in the historic centre of Beijing]]\n\nThe Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens.

To the north-west lies [[Beihai Park]], also centred on a lake connected to the southern two, and a popular royal park.\n\nTo the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines \u2013 the Imperial Shrine of Family or the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]]  ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u592a|\u5edf}}|p=T\u00e0imi\u00e0o}}) and the Imperial Shrine of State or [[Beijing Shejitan]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u793e|\u7a37|\u58c7|}}|p=Sh\u00e8j\u00ect\u00e1n}}), where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation, respectively. Today, these are the Beijing Labouring People's Cultural Hall<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31019.htm|title=Working People's Cultural Palace|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn}}</ref> and [[Zhongshan Park (Beijing)|Zhongshan Park]] (commemorating [[Sun Yat-sen]]) respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31020.htm|title=Zhongshan Park\n|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn}}</ref>\n\nTo the south, two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis. They are the [[Duanmen|Upright Gate]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u7aef|\u95e8}}|p=Du\u0101nm\u00e9n}}) and the more famous [[Tiananmen Gate]], which is decorated with a portrait of [[Mao Zedong]] in the centre and two placards to the left and right: \"Long Live the People's Republic of China\" and \"Long live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples\". The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern, symbolic centre of the Chinese state, Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhile development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Forbidden City Buffer Zone Plan submitted to World Heritage conference|url=https://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-07-16|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207165716/https://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2005, the Imperial City and [[Beihai Park|Beihai]] (as an extension item to the [[Summer Palace]]) were included in the shortlist for the next [[World Heritage Site]] in Beijing.<ref>{{cite news|first=Yang|last=Li|title=Beijing confirms 7 World Heritage alternate items; Large scale reconstruction of Imperial City halted|url=https://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-06-04|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206151702/https://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|archivedate=6 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Palace color decorative painting.JPG\n | alt1 = Palace color decorative painting\n | caption1 = Imperial Palace color decorative painting\n | image2 = HighStatusRoofDeco.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = [[Imperial roof decoration]] of the highest status on the roof ridge of the Hall of Supreme Harmony\n}}\n\nThe design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Religion in China|religious]] principles, and above all to symbolize the majesty of Imperial power. Some noted examples of symbolic designs include:\n* Yellow is the color of the Emperor. Thus almost all roofs in the Forbidden City bear yellow glazed tiles. There are only two exceptions. The library at the Pavilion of Literary Profundity ({{linktext|\u6587|\u6e0a|\u9601}}) had black tiles because black was associated with [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|water]], and thus fire-prevention.

The number of statuettes represents the status of the building \u2013 a minor building might have 3 or 5.

In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Empress. In the Qing dynasty, large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers. From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, the Empress moved out of the Palace. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor's wedding night.<ref name=\"Yu 80-83\">pp. 80\u201383, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nBetween these two palaces is the [[Hall of Union]], which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof.

Originally a minor palace, this became the ''de facto'' residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. In the last decades of the Qing dynasty, empresses dowager, including Cixi, held court from the eastern partition of the hall. Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are the offices of the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] and other key government bodies.<ref name=\"Yu 87\">p. 87, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nThe north-eastern section of the Inner Court is taken up by the Palace of Tranquil Longevity ({{linktext|\u5be7|\u58fd|\u5bae}}) (O), a complex built by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in anticipation of his retirement.

The Palaces lay to the West and to the East of the three main Palaces of the Inner Court, hence the names. There were six Western Palaces and six Eastern Palaces. \nA consort with the rank of concubine and above was allocated her own Palace and was named the manage of that Palace, an honor in itself. Lower ranking consorts (Noble Ladies and below) lived in separate chambers in the Palaces of the higher ranking consorts. Thus many of the Qing emperors were born and grew up in the Palaces.[60] During the late Qing era, Empress Dowager Cixi resided in one of the Western Palaces and became known as the \"Western empress\". Her co-regent Empress Dowager Ci'an lived in one of the Eastern Palaces and was thus known as the \u201cEastern empress\u201d.

Similar designs can be found throughout the Imperial City.]]\n\nReligion was an important part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese [[Taoism|Taoist]] religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.<ref name=\"Yu 176\">p. 176, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nAnother prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was [[Buddhism]]. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings.<ref name=\"Yu 177\">p. 177, Yu (1984)</ref> Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and [[mandala]]s, placed in ritualistic arrangements.<ref name=\"Yu 189-193\">pp. 189\u2013193, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Surroundings ===\n{{See also|Imperial City (Beijing)}}\n\n[[File:Beijing city wall map vectorized.svg|thumb|left|Location of the Forbidden City in the historic centre of Beijing]]\n\nThe Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens. To the north is [[Jingshan Park]], also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes.<ref name=\"Yu 20\">p. 20, Yu (1984)</ref>\n\nTo the west lies [[Zhongnanhai]], a former royal garden centred on two connected lakes, which now serves as the central headquarters for the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]]. To the north-west lies [[Beihai Park]], also centred on a lake connected to the southern two, and a popular royal park.\n\nTo the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines \u2013 the Imperial Shrine of Family or the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]]  ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u592a|\u5edf}}|p=T\u00e0imi\u00e0o}}) and the Imperial Shrine of State or [[Beijing Shejitan]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u793e|\u7a37|\u58c7|}}|p=Sh\u00e8j\u00ect\u00e1n}}), where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation, respectively. Today, these are the Beijing Labouring People's Cultural Hall<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31019.htm|title=Working People's Cultural Palace|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn}}</ref> and [[Zhongshan Park (Beijing)|Zhongshan Park]] (commemorating [[Sun Yat-sen]]) respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31020.htm|title=Zhongshan Park\n|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn}}</ref>\n\nTo the south, two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis. They are the [[Duanmen|Upright Gate]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u7aef|\u95e8}}|p=Du\u0101nm\u00e9n}}) and the more famous [[Tiananmen Gate]], which is decorated with a portrait of [[Mao Zedong]] in the centre and two placards to the left and right: \"Long Live the People's Republic of China\" and \"Long live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples\". The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern, symbolic centre of the Chinese state, Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhile development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Forbidden City Buffer Zone Plan submitted to World Heritage conference|url=https://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-07-16|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207165716/https://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2005, the Imperial City and [[Beihai Park|Beihai]] (as an extension item to the [[Summer Palace]]) were included in the shortlist for the next [[World Heritage Site]] in Beijing.<ref>{{cite news|first=Yang|last=Li|title=Beijing confirms 7 World Heritage alternate items; Large scale reconstruction of Imperial City halted|url=https://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-06-04|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206151702/https://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|archivedate=6 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Palace color decorative painting.JPG\n | alt1 = Palace color decorative painting\n | caption1 = Imperial Palace color decorative painting\n | image2 = HighStatusRoofDeco.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = [[Imperial roof decoration]] of the highest status on the roof ridge of the Hall of Supreme Harmony\n}}\n\nThe design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Religion in China|religious]] principles, and above all to symbolize the majesty of Imperial power. Some noted examples of symbolic designs include:\n* Yellow is the color of the Emperor. Thus almost all roofs in the Forbidden City bear yellow glazed tiles. There are only two exceptions. The library at the Pavilion of Literary Profundity ({{linktext|\u6587|\u6e0a|\u9601}}) had black tiles because black was associated with [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|water]], and thus fire-prevention. Similarly, the Crown Prince's residences have green tiles because green was associated with [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|wood]], and thus growth.<ref name=\"DPM Elements\" />\n* The main halls of the Outer and Inner courts are all arranged in groups of three \u2013 the shape of the [[Bagua (concept)|Qian]] triagram, representing Heaven. The residences of the Inner Court on the other hand are arranged in groups of six \u2013 the shape of the [[Bagua (concept)|Kun]] triagram, representing the Earth.<ref name=\"CCTV2\" />\n* The sloping ridges of building roofs are decorated with a [[Imperial roof decoration|line of statuettes]] led by a man riding a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and followed by an [[Chinese dragon|imperial dragon]]. The number of statuettes represents the status of the building \u2013 a minor building might have 3 or 5. The Hall of Supreme Harmony has 10, the only building in the country to be permitted this in Imperial times.

After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artefacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei.
