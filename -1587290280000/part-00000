It is commonly used as a [[Dipping sauce|dip]] alongside [[tortilla chip]]s, or as a condiment served along with dishes such as [[huevos rancheros]] or [[burrito]]s.\n\nIn the [[Hispanophone]] world, there are hundreds of different kinds of salsas used in a variety of culinary applications.\n\n==Pronunciation and etymology==\nThe word ''salsa'' entered the English language from the Spanish ''salsa'' (\"sauce\"), which itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''salsus'' (salted). The native Spanish pronunciation is {{IPA-es|\u02c8salsa|}}. In American English it can sometimes be pronounced with a short A sound ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u00e6|l|s|\u0259}}) especially in regions further North, while in British English it is pronounced with a long A sound ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u0251\u02d0|l|s|\u0259}}.)\n\n==Types==\n[[File:AGV 4558 (21982977281).jpg|thumbnail|250px|Various types of Mexican salsas, including [[mole sauce|moles]]]]\n[[File:Chorizo and egg burrito with salsa.jpg|thumb|A [[chorizo]] and egg [[breakfast burrito]] with salsa]]\n\nMexican salsas were traditionally produced using the [[mortar and pestle]]-like ''[[molcajete]]'', although [[blender (device)|blenders]] are now more commonly used. The [[Maya people|Maya]] made salsa also, using a mortar and pestle. Well-known ''salsas'' include:\n* ''[[Salsa roja]]'', \"red sauce\", is used as a [[condiment]] in Mexican and [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] (U.S.) cuisines; usually includes cooked [[tomato]]es, [[chili pepper]]s, [[onion]], [[garlic]], and fresh [[cilantro]] (coriander).\n* ''[[Pico de gallo]]'' (\"rooster's beak\"), also known as ''salsa fresca'' (\"fresh sauce\"), ''salsa picada'' (\"chopped sauce\"), or ''salsa mexicana'' (\"Mexican sauce\"), is made with raw tomatoes, lime juice, chilies, onions, cilantro leaves, and other coarsely chopped raw ingredients.\n* ''Salsa cruda'', \"raw sauce\", is an uncooked mixture of chopped tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1o chilies, and cilantro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519683/salsa-cruda|title=salsa cruda - food|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n* ''[[Salsa verde]]'', \"green sauce\", in Mexican versions, is made with [[tomatillo]]s, usually cooked.\n* ''Salsa negra'', \"black sauce\" is a Mexican sauce made from dried chilies, oil, and garlic.\n* ''Salsa taquera'', \"[[taco]] sauce\": Made with tomatillos and [[Chipotle|morita]] chili. In the U.S., the most common version contains tomato puree, vinegar, and chili pepper.\n* ''[[Salsa criolla]]'' is a South American salsa with a sliced-onion base.\n* ''Salsa ranchera'', \"ranch-style sauce\": Made with roasted tomatoes, various chilies, and spices, it typically is served warm, and possesses a thick, [[soup|liquid]]y quality.  It imparts a characteristic flavor reminiscent of [[black pepper]], though it often may not contain black pepper.\n* Creamy avocado salsa is a sauce made from avocado, lime, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o or serrano peppers, garlic, olive oil, cumin, and salt.\n* Mango salsa is a spicy-sweet sauce made from mangoes, used as a topping for nachos. It is often also used as a garnish on grilled chicken or grilled fish due to the sauce's gamut of complementary flavors.\n* Pineapple salsa is a spicy and sweet sauce made from pineapples, used as an alternative to the mango salsa.\n* Chipotle salsa is a smoky, spicy sauce made from smoked jalape\u00f1o chilies, tomatoes, garlic and spices.\n* Habanero salsa is an extremely spicy salsa, where the piquancy comes from [[Habanero|habanero chilies]].\n* Corn salsa is a chunky salsa made with sweetcorn and other ingredients, such as onions, and chiles (either poblano, bell chilies, and/or jalape\u00f1os). Made popular by burrito restaurant chains, for burritos, tacos, and quesadillas.\n* Carrot salsa is made with carrots as the base.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/realfooddailycoo0000gent |url-access=registration |last1=Gentry |first1=Ann |last2=Head |first2=Anthony |title=Real Food Daily Cookbook: Really Fresh, Really Good, Really Vegetarian |year=2005 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=1-58008-618-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/realfooddailycoo0000gent/page/64 64] }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:MangoPineappleSalsa.jpg|thumb|[[Mango]] [[pineapple]] salsa, made with [[jalape\u00f1o]]s, [[red onion]], and [[cilantro]] (coriander), served in a [[ramekin]]]]\nThere are many other salsas, both traditional and ''nouveau'', some are made with [[Mentha|mint]], [[pineapple]], or [[mango]].\n\nOutside Mexico and Central America, the following salsas are common to each of the following regions; in [[Argentina]] and the [[Southern Cone]], [[chimichurri]] sauce is common. Chimichurri is \"a spicy vinegar-parsley sauce that is the salsa (and leading condiment) in Argentina and [[Uruguay]], served with grilled meat. It is made of chopped fresh parsley and onion, seasoned with garlic, oregano, salt, cayenne chilies and black pepper and bound with oil and vinegar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/salsas/salsa-glossary-information.asp |title=Types Of Salsa |publisher=Thenibble.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> In Costa Rica, dishes are prepared with [[salsa Lizano]], a thin, smooth, light brown sauce. In [[Cuba]] and the [[Caribbean]], a typical salsa is ''[[Mojo (sauce)|mojo]]''. Unlike the tomato-based salsas, ''mojo'' typically consists of [[olive oil]], garlic, and citrus juice, and is used both to [[marinade|marinate]] meats and as a dipping sauce.\n\n==Prepared salsa==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}\nMost jarred, canned, and bottled salsa and picante sauces sold in the United States in [[supermarket|grocery stores]] are forms of ''salsa cruda'' or ''pico de gallo'', and typically have a semi-liquid texture. To increase their shelf lives, these salsas have been cooked to a temperature of {{convert|175|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, and are thus not truly ''cruda'' (raw). Some have added [[vinegar]], and some use [[pickled pepper]]s instead of fresh ones. Tomatoes are strongly acidic by nature, which, along with the heat processing, is enough to stabilize the product for grocery distribution.\n\n''Picante'' sauce of the American type is often thinner in consistency than what is labelled as \"salsa\". ''Picante'' is a Spanish adjective meaning \"piquant\", which derives from ''picar'' (\"to sting\"), referring to the feeling caused by salsas on one's tongue.\n\nMany grocery stores in the [[United States]] and Canada also sell fresh refrigerated salsa, usually in plastic containers. Fresh salsa is usually more expensive and has a shorter shelf life than canned or jarred salsa. It may or may not contain vinegar.\n\nTaco sauce is a condiment sold in American grocery stores and fast food [[Tex-Mex]] outlets. Taco sauce is similar to its Mexican counterpart in that it is smoothly blended, having the consistency of thin ketchup.  It is made from tomato paste instead of whole tomatoes and lacks the seeds and chunks of vegetables found in picante sauce.\n\nWhile some salsa fans do not consider jarred products to be real ''salsa cruda'', their widespread availability and long shelf life have been credited with much of salsa's enormous popularity in states outside the southwest, especially in areas where salsa is not a traditional part of the cuisine. In 1992, the dollar value of salsa sales in the United States exceeded those of [[tomato ketchup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/27/FDGH41DV331.DTL|title=Ketchup?

It is commonly used as a [[Dipping sauce|dip]] alongside [[tortilla chip]]s, or as a condiment served along with dishes such as [[huevos rancheros]] or [[burrito]]s.\n\nIn the [[Hispanophone]] world, there are hundreds of different kinds of salsas used in a variety of culinary applications.\n\n==Pronunciation and etymology==\nThe word ''salsa'' entered the English language from the Spanish ''salsa'' (\"sauce\"), which itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''salsus'' (salted). The native Spanish pronunciation is {{IPA-es|\u02c8salsa|}}. In American English it can sometimes be pronounced with a short A sound ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u00e6|l|s|\u0259}}) especially in regions further North, while in British English it is pronounced with a long A sound ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u0251\u02d0|l|s|\u0259}}.)\n\n==Types==\n[[File:AGV 4558 (21982977281).jpg|thumbnail|250px|Various types of Mexican salsas, including [[mole sauce|moles]]]]\n[[File:Chorizo and egg burrito with salsa.jpg|thumb|A [[chorizo]] and egg [[breakfast burrito]] with salsa]]\n\nMexican salsas were traditionally produced using the [[mortar and pestle]]-like ''[[molcajete]]'', although [[blender (device)|blenders]] are now more commonly used. The [[Maya people|Maya]] made salsa also, using a mortar and pestle. Well-known ''salsas'' include:\n* ''[[Salsa roja]]'', \"red sauce\", is used as a [[condiment]] in Mexican and [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] (U.S.) cuisines; usually includes cooked [[tomato]]es, [[chili pepper]]s, [[onion]], [[garlic]], and fresh [[cilantro]] (coriander).\n* ''[[Pico de gallo]]'' (\"rooster's beak\"), also known as ''salsa fresca'' (\"fresh sauce\"), ''salsa picada'' (\"chopped sauce\"), or ''salsa mexicana'' (\"Mexican sauce\"), is made with raw tomatoes, lime juice, chilies, onions, cilantro leaves, and other coarsely chopped raw ingredients.\n* ''Salsa cruda'', \"raw sauce\", is an uncooked mixture of chopped tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1o chilies, and cilantro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519683/salsa-cruda|title=salsa cruda - food|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n* ''[[Salsa verde]]'', \"green sauce\", in Mexican versions, is made with [[tomatillo]]s, usually cooked.\n* ''Salsa negra'', \"black sauce\" is a Mexican sauce made from dried chilies, oil, and garlic.\n* ''Salsa taquera'', \"[[taco]] sauce\": Made with tomatillos and [[Chipotle|morita]] chili. In the U.S., the most common version contains tomato puree, vinegar, and chili pepper.\n* ''[[Salsa criolla]]'' is a South American salsa with a sliced-onion base.\n* ''Salsa ranchera'', \"ranch-style sauce\": Made with roasted tomatoes, various chilies, and spices, it typically is served warm, and possesses a thick, [[soup|liquid]]y quality.  It imparts a characteristic flavor reminiscent of [[black pepper]], though it often may not contain black pepper.\n* Creamy avocado salsa is a sauce made from avocado, lime, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o or serrano peppers, garlic, olive oil, cumin, and salt.\n* Mango salsa is a spicy-sweet sauce made from mangoes, used as a topping for nachos. It is often also used as a garnish on grilled chicken or grilled fish due to the sauce's gamut of complementary flavors.\n* Pineapple salsa is a spicy and sweet sauce made from pineapples, used as an alternative to the mango salsa.\n* Chipotle salsa is a smoky, spicy sauce made from smoked jalape\u00f1o chilies, tomatoes, garlic and spices.\n* Habanero salsa is an extremely spicy salsa, where the piquancy comes from [[Habanero|habanero chilies]].\n* Corn salsa is a chunky salsa made with sweetcorn and other ingredients, such as onions, and chiles (either poblano, bell chilies, and/or jalape\u00f1os). Made popular by burrito restaurant chains, for burritos, tacos, and quesadillas.\n* Carrot salsa is made with carrots as the base.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/realfooddailycoo0000gent |url-access=registration |last1=Gentry |first1=Ann |last2=Head |first2=Anthony |title=Real Food Daily Cookbook: Really Fresh, Really Good, Really Vegetarian |year=2005 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=1-58008-618-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/realfooddailycoo0000gent/page/64 64] }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:MangoPineappleSalsa.jpg|thumb|[[Mango]] [[pineapple]] salsa, made with [[jalape\u00f1o]]s, [[red onion]], and [[cilantro]] (coriander), served in a [[ramekin]]]]\nThere are many other salsas, both traditional and ''nouveau'', some are made with [[Mentha|mint]], [[pineapple]], or [[mango]].\n\nOutside Mexico and Central America, the following salsas are common to each of the following regions; in [[Argentina]] and the [[Southern Cone]], [[chimichurri]] sauce is common. Chimichurri is \"a spicy vinegar-parsley sauce that is the salsa (and leading condiment) in Argentina and [[Uruguay]], served with grilled meat. It is made of chopped fresh parsley and onion, seasoned with garlic, oregano, salt, cayenne chilies and black pepper and bound with oil and vinegar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/salsas/salsa-glossary-information.asp |title=Types Of Salsa |publisher=Thenibble.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> In Costa Rica, dishes are prepared with [[salsa Lizano]], a thin, smooth, light brown sauce. In [[Cuba]] and the [[Caribbean]], a typical salsa is ''[[Mojo (sauce)|mojo]]''. Unlike the tomato-based salsas, ''mojo'' typically consists of [[olive oil]], garlic, and citrus juice, and is used both to [[marinade|marinate]] meats and as a dipping sauce.\n\n==Prepared salsa==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}\nMost jarred, canned, and bottled salsa and picante sauces sold in the United States in [[supermarket|grocery stores]] are forms of ''salsa cruda'' or ''pico de gallo'', and typically have a semi-liquid texture. To increase their shelf lives, these salsas have been cooked to a temperature of {{convert|175|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, and are thus not truly ''cruda'' (raw). Some have added [[vinegar]], and some use [[pickled pepper]]s instead of fresh ones. Tomatoes are strongly acidic by nature, which, along with the heat processing, is enough to stabilize the product for grocery distribution.\n\n''Picante'' sauce of the American type is often thinner in consistency than what is labelled as \"salsa\". ''Picante'' is a Spanish adjective meaning \"piquant\", which derives from ''picar'' (\"to sting\"), referring to the feeling caused by salsas on one's tongue.\n\nMany grocery stores in the [[United States]] and Canada also sell fresh refrigerated salsa, usually in plastic containers. Fresh salsa is usually more expensive and has a shorter shelf life than canned or jarred salsa. It may or may not contain vinegar.\n\nTaco sauce is a condiment sold in American grocery stores and fast food [[Tex-Mex]] outlets. Taco sauce is similar to its Mexican counterpart in that it is smoothly blended, having the consistency of thin ketchup.  It is made from tomato paste instead of whole tomatoes and lacks the seeds and chunks of vegetables found in picante sauce.\n\nWhile some salsa fans do not consider jarred products to be real ''salsa cruda'', their widespread availability and long shelf life have been credited with much of salsa's enormous popularity in states outside the southwest, especially in areas where salsa is not a traditional part of the cuisine. In 1992, the dollar value of salsa sales in the United States exceeded those of [[tomato ketchup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/27/FDGH41DV331.DTL|title=Ketchup?

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness.

The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.<ref>Matkovski, Aleksandar, ''Grbovite na Makedonija'', Skopje, 1970.</ref><ref>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 (1990) \u0413\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, Skopje, Macedonia&nbsp;\u2014 {{ISBN|86-15-00160-X}}<br></ref> Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] arose, which modeled itself after the earlier [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|Bulgarian revolutionary traditions]] and adopted their symbols as the [[Bulgarian lion|lion]], etc.<ref>Duncan M.

However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] is somewhat similar.\n* '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992\u20131995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is used unofficially by various  associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II. In 1995, [[Greece]] lodged a claim for [[Trademark|trademark protection]] of the Vergina Sun as a state symbol under [[WIPO]].<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/cgi-6te/guest/ifetch5?ENG+6TER+15+1151315-REVERSE+0+0+1055+F+125+431+101+25+SEP-0/HITNUM,B+KIND%2fEmblem+]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329000458/http://www.wipo.int/cgi-6te/guest/ifetch5?ENG%206TER%2015%201151315-REVERSE%200%200%201055%20F%20125%20431%20101%2025%20SEP-0%2FHITNUM%2CB%20KIND%2FEmblem%20 |title= wipo.int|date=29 March 2006 }}</ref> In [[Greece]] the symbol against a blue field is used vastly in the area of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and it has official status.The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent Republic of Macedonia, until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and [[Greece]] in September 1995.<ref>Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news |publisher=24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127053906/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 January 2006 | title= A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name?

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up. After the World War II ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of the region of Macedonia, then under communist control,<ref name=\"Barbara Jelavich\">History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization. The authorities projected the settlement of 50,000 families in Macedonia, though only 4,200 families had been placed in 280 colonies by 1940.\" For more see: Ivo Banac,  \"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations. Macedonia could confirm itself as a state with its own past, present and future only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. For more see: Mirjana Maleska.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\".

The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.
