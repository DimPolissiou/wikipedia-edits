In the [[Old-time radio|golden age of U.S. radio drama]], Mutual was best known as the original network home of ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' and as the long-time radio residence of ''[[The Shadow]]''. For many years, it was a national broadcaster for [[Major League Baseball on Mutual|Major League Baseball]] (including the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and [[World Series]]), the [[National Football League]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame football]]. From the mid-1930s and until the retirement of the network in 1999, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. During the late 1970s, Mutual pioneered the nationwide late night call-in radio show and introduced the country to [[Larry King]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, acting in much the same style as rival [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC]] had [[Cumulus Media Networks#ABC Radio Networks|two years earlier]] (in 1968), Mutual launched four subsidiary radio networks: [[Mutual Black Network]] (MBN) (initially launched as \"Mutual Reports\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Ray Broadus|last2=Browne|first2=Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|date=2001|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=9780879728212|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=mutual+reports+service+of+mutual+black+network&source=bl&ots=or7kgbvCIS&sig=ZcgR6oV6St0tU407E4J67Qz_Cjk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy0YbU7-zWAhVL4iYKHTOaARkQ6AEIQzAH#v=onepage&q=mutual%20reports%20service%20of%20mutual%20black%20network&f=false|language=en|quote=Mutual Reports eventually became Mutual Black Network (MBN)}}</ref>), which evolved to today's [[American Urban Radio Networks]] (AURN); Mutual Cadena Hisp\u00e1nica  (trans. \"Mutual Spanish Network\"); Mutual Southwest Network, and [[Mutual Lifestyle Radio|Mutual Progressive Network]] (was later re-branded \"Mutual Lifestyle Radio\" in 1980, then retired in 1983).\n\nOf the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s, but the least certain financial position <ref>Dick Rosse. \"How Sweet It Was.\" Broadcasting & Cable, April 19, 1999, pp. 74, 76.</ref> (which prevented Mutual from expanding into television broadcasting after World War II, as the other three networks did). For the first 18 years of its existence, Mutual was owned and operated as a [[cooperative]] (a system similar to that of today's [[National Public Radio]]), setting the network apart from its corporate owned competitors. Mutual's member stations shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. From December 30, 1936, when it debuted in the West, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after [[General Tire]] assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.\n\nOnce General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign [[propaganda]]. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed ownership several times  in succeeding years\u2014even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.\n\n==History==\n===1934\u20131935: The launch of Mutual===\nAttempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the '''Quality Network'''. Five years later (in 1934), a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Mutual's original participating stations were [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]\u2013[[Newark, New Jersey]], just outside New York (owned by the [[Bamberger's#1929-1959|Bamberger Broadcasting Service]], a division of [[Macy's|R.H.

The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50% of the stock\u2014five each of the ten total shares.<ref>Robinson (1979), p. 28; Cox (2002), p. 177; {{cite web|author=McLeod, Elizabeth |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mutual.html|title=Some History of the Mutual Broadcasting System|date=1999\u20132002 |accessdate=2010-03-01 |publisher=History of American Broadcasting (Jeff Miller)}} Extensive discussion of the network's history and organization by radio historian.

In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had ''[[The Witch's Tale]]'', a horror anthology series whose \"hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old\" narrator invited listeners to \"douse all [the] lights.

Anthony and sponsored by  [[physical culture]] guru [[Bernarr Macfadden]]. The program was a new take on ''Ask Mister Anthony'', which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, \"dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code.\" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his work\u2014he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.<ref>Hilmes (1997), pp. 99\u2013100; Jaker et al.

As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the [[Federal Communications Commission]], Mutual \"offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games.\" This was the first example given in the ruling of \"abuses\" perpetrated by the two leading broadcast companies.<ref name=NBCvUS/>\n\nMutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget.

Among these was [[Sigrid Schultz]], the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.<ref>Brown (1998), p. 180; Bliss (1991), pp. 97\u201398.</ref>\n\n===1940s: One of the \"Big Four\"===\nEarly in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:\n<blockquote>\nUntil January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'', participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network....

Several Mutual radio affiliates launched their own television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]],  [[NBC]], [[CBS]] or [[DuMont Network|DuMont]]. The cooperative also held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the [[tabloid talk show]] and [[reality television|\"reality\" programming]]: the crabby gabfest ''[[Leave It to the Girls]]'' and, in particular, ''[[Queen for a Day]],'' which both started on Mutual radio in 1945.

Though ''The Lone Ranger'' moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as ''[[Nick Carter (literary character)|The Return of Nick Carter]]'' and later retitled ''Nick Carter, Master Detective'', it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' starring [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]], reprising their roles from the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] film series.

In October, the detective series ''[[Let George Do It (radio)|Let George Do It]]'', starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, [[Steve Allen]] got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show ''Smile Time'', out of Los Angeles's [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]]. In February 1947, the religiously oriented ''[[Family Theater]]'' premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, [[Kate Smith]], a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: ''Kate Smith Speaks'', at noon, and ''Kate Smith Sings'', later in the hour.<ref name=\"Dunning-1998\">Dunning (1998), p. 382.</ref> The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist [[Wyllis Cooper]] and his highly regarded suspense anthology ''[[Quiet, Please]]'', which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor [[Alan Ladd]]'s similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, ''[[Box 13]]'', which ran for precisely a year.

General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control.

Jacobs Company, whose chairman, [[Alexander Guterma]], envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, [[Hal Roach Studios]]. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was foundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire radio industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire season\u2014but there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known in the industry as \"sustaining\" shows.<ref>See Bareiss (1998), pp. 379\u201382; in particular, p. 381, for the development of limited sponsorship.</ref> The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the \"mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television&nbsp;....

Jacobs put Mutual into [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as \"foreign agents\"; they were charged with secretly accepting money from [[Dominican Republic]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.<ref>Ward (2005), pp. 152\u201355; \"The Price of Publicity,\" ''Time'', September 14, 1959 (available [http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866006,00.html online]). {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage.

As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to escalate in mid-1950, Mutual began airing two special nightly reports on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August 1950, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than NBC or ABC.<ref>Bliss (1991), pp. 258\u201359.</ref> In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, ''The World Today'', hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of ''[[The March of Time]]''. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joseph McCarthy]] as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the CBS TV show ''[[See It Now]]'', hosted by [[Edward R. Murrow]]. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as \"the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.\"<ref>Doherty (2003), p. 184.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'', which had originated at Mutual cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed ''Sergeant Preston of the Yukon'', ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with ''[[2000 Plus]]'', which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]''. ''The Shadow'''s long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, ''[[Counterspy (radio series)|Counterspy]]'' and ''[[Gang Busters]]'', both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be 1973 before Mutual would broadcast  a new dramatic series.

The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7&nbsp;p.m. slot.<ref>Bliss (1991), pp. 62\u201363.</ref> When [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] \"split\" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Meanwhile, the network was undergoing some management instability, with frequent changes at the top: for example, Matthew J. Culligan was Mutual's president from October 1966 to June 1968.  He was replaced by Robert R. Pauley, who came over from the ABC radio division, where he had served as president for nearly seven years.<ref>\"Robert Pauley Heads Radio Network.\" (Washington DC) Evening Star, June 27, 1968, p. 2</ref>  But Pauley only lasted a year, and resigned after clashes with the board over the need for cost-cutting, and other decisions with which he disagreed. His replacement was Victor C. Diehm, owner of several Mutual-affiliated radio stations and active on the Mutual Affiliates Advisory Council.<ref>\"Victor Diehm New Prexy of MBS As Radio Web Regroups, Cuts Costs.\" Variety, October 22, 1969, p.46.</ref>  But Diehm also did not remain in the position of Mutual's president for very long.  Four years later, he was replaced by a new president, a former Miami radio executive named [[Twenty-One (game show)#Aftermath|C. Edward Little]]. Under Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s).\n\nIn 1967, Ohio businessman Daniel H. Overmeyer looked to start his own TV network, and sought a merger with Mutual; the offer was quickly rebuffed, but three Mutual stockholders joined with eleven other investors to buy Overmyer's hookup and rename it the [[United Network]]. The net (and its only offering, \"The Las Vegas Show\") folded after only a month on the air. On May 1, 1972, the network launched the [[Mutual Black Network]] (MBN) and the [[Mutual Spanish Network]] (Mutual Cadena Hisp\u00e1nica); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.<ref>''1973 World Book'' (1973), p. 479.</ref> While the Spanish-language service would last only six months, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.<ref>Thompson (1993), p. 192 n. 85.</ref> It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of [[American Urban Radio Networks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aurn.com/affiliates/aurnleadership.php |title=Company Profile\u2014Leadership |accessdate=2010-03-01 |publisher=American Urban Radio Networks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914195358/http://www.aurn.com/affiliates/aurnleadership.php |archivedate=September 14, 2011 }}</ref> Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and [[Mutual Lifestyle Radio]], followed from Mutual.\n\nIn 1974, Mutual began using its distinctive \"Mutualert\" network cue tones, or \"bee-doops\" as they were frequently called. The Mutual \"bee-doops\" were heard at the beginning and end of Mutual newscasts, programs, between commercials and network identification breaks. The \"bee-doops\" were retained by [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] for several years after it retired Mutual in 1999.\nOn September 30, 1977, [[Amway]] bought the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysdta.org/STC/58244.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071025060344/http://www.nysdta.org/STC/58244.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-25|title=In the Matter of the Petition of Mutual Broadcasting System Inc. for Redetermination of a Deficiency (New York State Tax Commission ruling)|date=1987-08-27|accessdate=2010-03-01|publisher=New York State Division of Tax Appeals}}</ref> Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.<ref>\"Mutual Radio Applies to F.C.C. to Be First All-Satellite Network,\" ''New York Times'', November 22, 1977; U.S. Congress, House Committee on Appropriations, ''Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1986'', p. 198.</ref> In 1979, Amway purchased [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] from the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]]. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year\u2014950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.<ref name=\"Cox-2002\"/> It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.\n\n====Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show====\nOne of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era, rapidly became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in radio program, which launched on November 3, 1975, with [[Herb Jepko]] as host.<ref>Cox (2009), p. 84.</ref> Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of [[KSL (AM)|KSL]] in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversial topics, that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by [[Long John Nebel]] and [[Candy Jones]], before Mutual hired a little-known local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. On January 30, 1978, [[Larry King]] made his national debut on Mutual; by early 1980, King's increasingly popular all-night program was being carried by around 200 stations and was credited with attracting many new affiliates to the network.<ref>\"Radio's Latest Boom: Late-Night Talk Shows, ''New York Times'', May 2, 1982 (available [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EEDC1F39F931A35756C0A964948260&sec=&pagewanted=1 online]); \"TV Mailbag\u2014About Radio Talk Shows,\" ''New York Times'', June 20, 1982 (available [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01EEDC143BF933A15755C0A964948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fR%2fRadio online]).</ref> King continued with his Mutual call-in show until 1994, even long after he began appearing on a highly successful television program for [[CNN]] in 1985.

At the conclusion of each episode, listeners were invited to get the organization's pamphlet \"America First.\"  Charges were made that Benjamin Gilbert, who was a principal owner of the network in the 1970s, had contributed thousands of dollars to the organization.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17795343/liberty_lobby_19740717_p19/</ref>\n\n===1980s\u20131990s: The end of Mutual===\nIn 1980, Amway purchased [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market [[owned-and-operated station]]. ''On a Country Road'', a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At the beginning of 1980, Mutual picked up the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'', formerly broadcast over the [[CBS Radio Network]], and renamed it ''Mutual Radio Theater''. The program was heard five nights per week, and turned out to be Mutual's final radio drama series. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of this anthology series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Judge, Dick|url=http://www.old-time.com/otrlogs2/mutualrt_dj.log.txt|title=Mutual Radio Theater|date=2005-12-03|accessdate=2010-03-01|work=|publisher=Original Old-Time Radio (OTR) WWW Pages}}</ref> In 1981, Mutual launched ''[[Dick Clark]]'s National Music Survey'', a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual.<ref>\"Network Radio Is Tuning into Satellites,\" ''New York Times'', August 2, 1981; \"Radio Networks: New 'Golden Age,'\" ''New York Times'', May 1, 1982; \"Bringing 'Turnkey' Radio into Everybody's Backyard,\" ''New York Times'', June 13, 1982.</ref> The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business.

Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences.  Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked.  And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Westwood-One-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Westwood One, Inc.\u2014Company History|year=1998|accessdate=2010-03-01|work= International Directory of Company Histories |publisher=Funding Universe}}</ref> In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.<ref>\"Westwood to Buy Mutual Network,\" ''New York Times'', September 17, 1984; \"Business People; Head of Westwood One Elated by Mutual Deal,\" ''New York Times'', September 18, 1984; Cox (2002), p. 178.</ref> \"It's a perfect fit,\" declared Westwood head Norman J.

Mutual was now part of a much larger programming service, and its identity was being gradually phased out. In 1993, when Larry King switched his all-night radio show to a shorter daytime version a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus\n[[Jim Bohannon]]; Bohannon began on Mutual as King's fill-in host and later hosted his own weekend call-in show, identical to King's.<ref name=\"Lucier-1998\">Lucier (1998).</ref> Westwood One was taken over by [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]] in 1994.<ref>\"Company News; Westwood One Completes Purchase of Unistar Radio,\" ''New York Times'', February 5, 1994 (available [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DD1F39F936A35751C0A962958260 online]).</ref> In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.<ref>\"To Infinity and Beyond: Is a Radio Deal Too Big?; Westinghouse Would Own 32% of Top Markets,\" ''New York Times'', June 21, 1996; \"Two Radio Giants to Merge, Forming Biggest Network,\" ''New York Times'', June 21, 1996;  \"F.C.C.

Sources differ on whether WGN\u2013Chicago, Mutual's fourth original member, or another Chicago station, [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], represented the city in the Quality Network. In addition, there is no consensus on the fundamental matter of the degree of connection involved: some sources claim the Quality Network had ceased to exist by the end of 1929; others that it carried on and simply changed its name and formalized its structure in 1934. As scholar James Schwoch (1994) puts it, \"The origins of the Mutual Broadcasting System are somewhat murky and open to dispute.\" Indeed, a claim Schwoch makes just two sentences later\u2014that \"the permanent establishment of the Mutual network is bound up in the popularity of a single radio program, 'The Lone Ranger'\"\u2014is disputed by several scholars.<ref name=ShowPop/></li>\n<li>{{Note label|B|b|none}} Start and end dates for original dramatic and quiz series given in the main text are based on the standard and most comprehensive reference work, ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', by John Dunning (1998). Dunning's detailed information has been checked, where available, against the even more detailed reports of [http://www.otrsite.com/radiolog/index.html Jerry Haendiges' Vintage Radio Logs] and against the much less detailed but more recently published ''The Encyclopedia of American Radio: An A\u2013Z Guide to Radio from Jack Benny to Howard Stern'', by Ron Lackmann (2000). Dunning and Haendiges agree in almost all cases where they both cover a show. In the few cases where they differ slightly, a specific citation is given to the one whose data appears better supported, internally and/or by reference to Lackmann.</li>\n<li>{{Note label|C|c|none}} The two available authoritative sources differ widely on the affiliate figures for the year.

Marshall says that a contract was signed on December 26, 1950, between baseball's major leagues, in the person of Commissioner [[Happy Chandler]], on one side and Mutual and the [[Global Gillette|Gillette Safety Razor Company]] on the other for the television rights. Day says baseball's contract was solely with Gillette, that it was for both radio and television rights, and that Gillette \"[l]ess than a year after acquiring the broadcast rights ... transferred\" them to Mutual. They also characterize the original contract rather differently. Marshall calls it \"one of the outstanding achievements of the Chandler commissionership.\" Day credits Chandler with \"deftly avoid[ing] a financial crisis,\" but agrees with the prevailing opinion of the players that Chandler \"vastly underestimated the value\" of the rights. The fact, which Day provides, that Mutual sold the package to NBC for $4 million a year lends support to his position.<ref name=M&D/></li>\n<li>{{Note label|H|h|none}} Mutual does have a TV network in the realm of imagination.

In the [[Old-time radio|golden age of U.S. radio drama]], Mutual was best known as the original network home of ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' and as the long-time radio residence of ''[[The Shadow]]''. For many years, it was a national broadcaster for [[Major League Baseball on Mutual|Major League Baseball]] (including the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and [[World Series]]), the [[National Football League]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame football]]. From the mid-1930s and until the retirement of the network in 1999, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. During the late 1970s, Mutual pioneered the nationwide late night call-in radio show and introduced the country to [[Larry King]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, acting in much the same style as rival [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC]] had [[Cumulus Media Networks#ABC Radio Networks|two years earlier]] (in 1968), Mutual launched four subsidiary radio networks: [[Mutual Black Network]] (MBN) (initially launched as \"Mutual Reports\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Ray Broadus|last2=Browne|first2=Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|date=2001|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=9780879728212|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=mutual+reports+service+of+mutual+black+network&source=bl&ots=or7kgbvCIS&sig=ZcgR6oV6St0tU407E4J67Qz_Cjk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy0YbU7-zWAhVL4iYKHTOaARkQ6AEIQzAH#v=onepage&q=mutual%20reports%20service%20of%20mutual%20black%20network&f=false|language=en|quote=Mutual Reports eventually became Mutual Black Network (MBN)}}</ref>), which evolved to today's [[American Urban Radio Networks]] (AURN); Mutual Cadena Hisp\u00e1nica  (trans. \"Mutual Spanish Network\"); Mutual Southwest Network, and [[Mutual Lifestyle Radio|Mutual Progressive Network]] (was later re-branded \"Mutual Lifestyle Radio\" in 1980, then retired in 1983).\n\nOf the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s, but the least certain financial position <ref>Dick Rosse. \"How Sweet It Was.\" Broadcasting & Cable, April 19, 1999, pp. 74, 76.</ref> (which prevented Mutual from expanding into television broadcasting after World War II, as the other three networks did). For the first 18 years of its existence, Mutual was owned and operated as a [[cooperative]] (a system similar to that of today's [[National Public Radio]]), setting the network apart from its corporate owned competitors. Mutual's member stations shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. From December 30, 1936, when it debuted in the West, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after [[General Tire]] assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.\n\nOnce General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign [[propaganda]]. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed ownership several times  in succeeding years\u2014even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.\n\n==History==\n===1934\u20131935: The launch of Mutual===\nAttempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the '''Quality Network'''. Five years later (in 1934), a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Mutual's original participating stations were [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]\u2013[[Newark, New Jersey]], just outside New York (owned by the [[Bamberger's#1929-1959|Bamberger Broadcasting Service]], a division of [[Macy's|R.H.

The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50% of the stock\u2014five each of the ten total shares.<ref>Robinson (1979), p. 28; Cox (2002), p. 177; {{cite web|author=McLeod, Elizabeth |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mutual.html|title=Some History of the Mutual Broadcasting System|date=1999\u20132002 |accessdate=2010-03-01 |publisher=History of American Broadcasting (Jeff Miller)}} Extensive discussion of the network's history and organization by radio historian. Note that the page's introductory content (not written by McLeod) gives September 15, 1934, as the network's organizational date, apparently based on a 1999 newspaper article reproduced at the bottom of the page.

(The newspaper article also incorrectly states that the network featured commentator [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]]; it never did. His shows appeared on NBC and NBC Blue/ABC.

In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had ''[[The Witch's Tale]]'', a horror anthology series whose \"hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old\" narrator invited listeners to \"douse all [the] lights.

Anthony and sponsored by  [[physical culture]] guru [[Bernarr Macfadden]]. The program was a new take on ''Ask Mister Anthony'', which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, \"dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code.\" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his work\u2014he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.<ref>Hilmes (1997), pp. 99\u2013100; Jaker et al.

But, as one chronicler put it, \"nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.\"<ref>Callow (1995), p. 321.</ref>\n\nIn April 1938, the network picked up ''[[The Green Hornet (radio series)|The Green Hornet]]'' from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue.

As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the [[Federal Communications Commission]], Mutual \"offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games.\" This was the first example given in the ruling of \"abuses\" perpetrated by the two leading broadcast companies.<ref name=NBCvUS/>\n\nMutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter [[Gabriel Heatter]] from the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] \"trial of the century\" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.<ref>Bliss (1991), pp. 34, 36.</ref> In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator [[Raymond Gram Swing]], who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.<ref>Bliss (1991), pp. 60\u201361.</ref> In November 1937, conservative commentator [[Fulton Lewis|Fulton Lewis Jr.]], heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate [[WOL (AM)|WOL]], became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.<ref>Nimmo and Newsome (1997), p. 173.</ref> In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the [[BBC]] and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was [[Sigrid Schultz]], the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.<ref>Brown (1998), p. 180; Bliss (1991), pp. 97\u201398.</ref>\n\n===1940s: One of the \"Big Four\"===\nEarly in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:\n<blockquote>\nUntil January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'', participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.<ref>Rose (1971), p. 68.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Mutual Broadcasting System - Fulton Lewis Radio 1940s-1950s Commercial.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=On the left, a suited man seated before a microphone, smiling and holding a script.

With [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Network\u2014with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares\u2014to the Ohio-based [[General Tire and Rubber Company]].<ref name=BosTime/><ref>Jaker et al.

Several Mutual radio affiliates launched their own television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]],  [[NBC]], [[CBS]] or [[DuMont Network|DuMont]]. The cooperative also held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the [[tabloid talk show]] and [[reality television|\"reality\" programming]]: the crabby gabfest ''[[Leave It to the Girls]]'' and, in particular, ''[[Queen for a Day]],'' which both started on Mutual radio in 1945.

''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as ''[[Nick Carter (literary character)|The Return of Nick Carter]]'' and later retitled ''Nick Carter, Master Detective'', it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' starring [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]], reprising their roles from the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] film series.

In February 1947, the religiously oriented ''[[Family Theater]]'' premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, [[Kate Smith]], a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual.

After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was foundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire radio industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire season\u2014but there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known in the industry as \"sustaining\" shows.<ref>See Bareiss (1998), pp. 379\u201382; in particular, p. 381, for the development of limited sponsorship.</ref> The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the \"mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television&nbsp;....

In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as \"foreign agents\"; they were charged with secretly accepting money from [[Dominican Republic]] dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.<ref>Ward (2005), pp. 152\u201355; \"The Price of Publicity,\" ''Time'', September 14, 1959 (available [http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866006,00.html online]). {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage.

As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to escalate in mid-1950, Mutual began airing two special nightly reports on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August 1950, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than NBC or ABC.<ref>Bliss (1991), pp. 258\u201359.</ref> In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, ''The World Today'', hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of ''[[The March of Time]]''. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joseph McCarthy]] as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the CBS TV show ''[[See It Now]]'', hosted by [[Edward R.

In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as \"the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.\"<ref>Doherty (2003), p. 184.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'', which had originated at Mutual cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed ''Sergeant Preston of the Yukon'', ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with ''[[2000 Plus]]'', which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]''. ''The Shadow'''s long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, ''[[Counterspy (radio series)|Counterspy]]'' and ''[[Gang Busters]]'', both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be 1973 before Mutual would broadcast  a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team [[Bob and Ray]] came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.<ref>{{cite web|author=Griffith, Benjamin|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200115/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717012342/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200115/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-17|title=Bob and Ray|date=2002-01-29 |accessdate=2010-03-01|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture |publisher=BNET (CBS Interactive)}}</ref> Kate Smith returned in January 1958 for her final radio series, which ran until August.<ref name=\"Dunning-1998\"/> Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a Major League Baseball ''Game of the Day,'' every day except Sunday.

Meanwhile, the network was undergoing some management instability, with frequent changes at the top: for example, Matthew J. Culligan was Mutual's president from October 1966 to June 1968.  He was replaced by Robert R. Pauley, who came over from the ABC radio division, where he had served as president for nearly seven years.<ref>\"Robert Pauley Heads Radio Network.\" (Washington DC) Evening Star, June 27, 1968, p. 2</ref>  But Pauley only lasted a year, and resigned after clashes with the board over the need for cost-cutting, and other decisions with which he disagreed. His replacement was Victor C. Diehm, owner of several Mutual-affiliated radio stations and active on the Mutual Affiliates Advisory Council.<ref>\"Victor Diehm New Prexy of MBS As Radio Web Regroups, Cuts Costs.\" Variety, October 22, 1969, p.46.</ref>  But Diehm also did not remain in the position of Mutual's president for very long.  Four years later, he was replaced by a new president, a former Miami radio executive named [[Twenty-One (game show)#Aftermath|C. Edward Little]]. Under Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s).\n\nIn 1967, Ohio businessman Daniel H. Overmeyer looked to start his own TV network, and sought a merger with Mutual; the offer was quickly rebuffed, but three Mutual stockholders joined with eleven other investors to buy Overmyer's hookup and rename it the [[United Network]]. The net (and its only offering, \"The Las Vegas Show\") folded after only a month on the air. On May 1, 1972, the network launched the [[Mutual Black Network]] (MBN) and the [[Mutual Spanish Network]] (Mutual Cadena Hisp\u00e1nica); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.<ref>''1973 World Book'' (1973), p. 479.</ref> While the Spanish-language service would last only six months, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.<ref>Thompson (1993), p. 192 n. 85.</ref> It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of [[American Urban Radio Networks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aurn.com/affiliates/aurnleadership.php |title=Company Profile\u2014Leadership |accessdate=2010-03-01 |publisher=American Urban Radio Networks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914195358/http://www.aurn.com/affiliates/aurnleadership.php |archivedate=September 14, 2011 }}</ref> Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and [[Mutual Lifestyle Radio]], followed from Mutual.\n\nIn 1974, Mutual began using its distinctive \"Mutualert\" network cue tones, or \"bee-doops\" as they were frequently called. The Mutual \"bee-doops\" were heard at the beginning and end of Mutual newscasts, programs, between commercials and network identification breaks. The \"bee-doops\" were retained by [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] for several years after it retired Mutual in 1999.\nOn September 30, 1977, [[Amway]] bought the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysdta.org/STC/58244.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071025060344/http://www.nysdta.org/STC/58244.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-25|title=In the Matter of the Petition of Mutual Broadcasting System Inc. for Redetermination of a Deficiency (New York State Tax Commission ruling)|date=1987-08-27|accessdate=2010-03-01|publisher=New York State Division of Tax Appeals}}</ref> Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.<ref>\"Mutual Radio Applies to F.C.C. to Be First All-Satellite Network,\" ''New York Times'', November 22, 1977; U.S. Congress, House Committee on Appropriations, ''Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1986'', p. 198.</ref> In 1979, Amway purchased [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] from the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]]. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year\u2014950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.<ref name=\"Cox-2002\"/> It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.\n\n====Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show====\nOne of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era, rapidly became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in radio program, which launched on November 3, 1975, with [[Herb Jepko]] as host.<ref>Cox (2009), p. 84.</ref> Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of [[KSL (AM)|KSL]] in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversial topics, that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by [[Long John Nebel]] and [[Candy Jones]], before Mutual hired a little-known local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. On January 30, 1978, [[Larry King]] made his national debut on Mutual; by early 1980, King's increasingly popular all-night program was being carried by around 200 stations and was credited with attracting many new affiliates to the network.<ref>\"Radio's Latest Boom: Late-Night Talk Shows, ''New York Times'', May 2, 1982 (available [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EEDC1F39F931A35756C0A964948260&sec=&pagewanted=1 online]); \"TV Mailbag\u2014About Radio Talk Shows,\" ''New York Times'', June 20, 1982 (available [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01EEDC143BF933A15755C0A964948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fR%2fRadio online]).</ref> King continued with his Mutual call-in show until 1994, even long after he began appearing on a highly successful television program for [[CNN]] in 1985.

''On a Country Road'', a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At the beginning of 1980, Mutual picked up the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'', formerly broadcast over the [[CBS Radio Network]], and renamed it ''Mutual Radio Theater''. The program was heard five nights per week, and turned out to be Mutual's final radio drama series.

In 1993, when Larry King switched his all-night radio show to a shorter daytime version a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus\n[[Jim Bohannon]]; Bohannon began on Mutual as King's fill-in host and later hosted his own weekend call-in show, identical to King's.<ref name=\"Lucier-1998\">Lucier (1998).</ref> Westwood One was taken over by [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]] in 1994.<ref>\"Company News; Westwood One Completes Purchase of Unistar Radio,\" ''New York Times'', February 5, 1994 (available [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DD1F39F936A35751C0A962958260 online]).</ref> In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.<ref>\"To Infinity and Beyond: Is a Radio Deal Too Big?; Westinghouse Would Own 32% of Top Markets,\" ''New York Times'', June 21, 1996; \"Two Radio Giants to Merge, Forming Biggest Network,\" ''New York Times'', June 21, 1996;  \"F.C.C.

Sources differ on whether WGN\u2013Chicago, Mutual's fourth original member, or another Chicago station, [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], represented the city in the Quality Network. In addition, there is no consensus on the fundamental matter of the degree of connection involved: some sources claim the Quality Network had ceased to exist by the end of 1929; others that it carried on and simply changed its name and formalized its structure in 1934. As scholar James Schwoch (1994) puts it, \"The origins of the Mutual Broadcasting System are somewhat murky and open to dispute.\" Indeed, a claim Schwoch makes just two sentences later\u2014that \"the permanent establishment of the Mutual network is bound up in the popularity of a single radio program, 'The Lone Ranger'\"\u2014is disputed by several scholars.<ref name=ShowPop/></li>\n<li>{{Note label|B|b|none}} Start and end dates for original dramatic and quiz series given in the main text are based on the standard and most comprehensive reference work, ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', by John Dunning (1998). Dunning's detailed information has been checked, where available, against the even more detailed reports of [http://www.otrsite.com/radiolog/index.html Jerry Haendiges' Vintage Radio Logs] and against the much less detailed but more recently published ''The Encyclopedia of American Radio: An A\u2013Z Guide to Radio from Jack Benny to Howard Stern'', by Ron Lackmann (2000). Dunning and Haendiges agree in almost all cases where they both cover a show. In the few cases where they differ slightly, a specific citation is given to the one whose data appears better supported, internally and/or by reference to Lackmann.</li>\n<li>{{Note label|C|c|none}} The two available authoritative sources differ widely on the affiliate figures for the year.

Marshall says that a contract was signed on December 26, 1950, between baseball's major leagues, in the person of Commissioner [[Happy Chandler]], on one side and Mutual and the [[Global Gillette|Gillette Safety Razor Company]] on the other for the television rights. Day says baseball's contract was solely with Gillette, that it was for both radio and television rights, and that Gillette \"[l]ess than a year after acquiring the broadcast rights ... transferred\" them to Mutual. They also characterize the original contract rather differently. Marshall calls it \"one of the outstanding achievements of the Chandler commissionership.\" Day credits Chandler with \"deftly avoid[ing] a financial crisis,\" but agrees with the prevailing opinion of the players that Chandler \"vastly underestimated the value\" of the rights. The fact, which Day provides, that Mutual sold the package to NBC for $4 million a year lends support to his position.<ref name=M&D/></li>\n<li>{{Note label|H|h|none}} Mutual does have a TV network in the realm of imagination.

A [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|post-deregulation]] joint venture between [[Weston-super-Mare]] based bus company [[Badgerline]] and [[Isle of Wight]] bus company [[Southern Vectis]], it was set up in September 1987 to compete with incumbent operator [[Wilts & Dorset]]. The buses all used the [[Badgerline]] brand. After a noted [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom#Bus wars|bus war]] between the two large companies, Badger Vectis folded in March 1988.\n\n==Formation==\nBadger Vectis was formed in September 1987 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Badgerline]] (80%) and [[Southern Vectis]] (20%), after both recently privatised bus companies had failed in a joint bid earlier in the year to buy [[Wilts & Dorset]], which was, like its suitors, a former nationalised [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]] subsidiary. Wilts & Dorset had instead been privatised via a [[management buyout]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/2nd-july-1987/25/wilts-bought-out Wilts bought out] ''Commercial Motor'' 2 July 1987 page 25</ref> Badgerline had already been competing with Wilts & Dorset in [[Salisbury]] since June 1987, while Southern Vectis had already set up a mainland subsidiary, [[Bluestar (bus company)|Solent Blue Line]], to compete in [[Southampton]].\n\nHeaded by a regional director from Badgerline, the new operation used vehicles from both partners, as well as from elsewhere, and rented garage space from the other local operator [[Yellow Buses]] at their Mallard Road depot, in north-east [[Bournemouth]]. It traded as Badgerline, using the same livery as its parent company, although with more green on the front of buses, due to a perceived clash with Yellow Buses' livery.\n\n==Operation==\nBadger Vectis competed with Wilts & Dorset using a network focused on urban routes, radiating from Poole, with an important corridor being the coast road between Poole and Bournemouth. The company's tactic was to use a combination of a frequent and simple to understand [[Iveco]] minibus operated routes, branded as ''Minilinks'', together with 2 person [[Conductor (transportation)#Bus conductor|crew-operated]] larger buses, [[Bristol RE]] single-deck buses, to compete with Wilts & Dorset's largely archaic, complex and infrequent, established operations, which had no minibuses and no crew operated buses, and which had routes which ranged over a large rural area as well as the conurbation. Badger Vectis also operated cross-linked services to differentiate itself with Wilts & Dorset's routes.\n\nAfter just a week, Wilts & Dorset retaliated by setting up a high-frequency sub-brand of its own, called ''Skippers'', initially using conventional buses, but from November, using brand new [[MCW Metrorider]] minibuses. The competition saw the Poole to Bournemouth corridor eventually served by a total of 18 buses an hour.\n\nBadger Vectis did not operate into Poole bus station however, which was described as a major problem. Other issues for the company which emerged were reliability problems with its older Bristol REs, as well as recruitment issues, and the relatively higher cost of crew operation. Despite their garage rental arrangement, by the beginning of March 1988, Badger Vectis also began to compete directly with Yellow Buses, having previously avoided their routes.\n\n==Cessation==\nThe financial health of Badger Vectis declined due to its problems, and the retaliation by Wilts & Dorset. In a development described as an implosion, Badger Vectis gave notice to the traffic commissioner that it would stop operating in early May 1988.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-april-1988/15/badgerline-loses-bus-war Badgerline loses bus war] ''Commercial Motor'' 7 April 1988 page 15</ref> The company closed early however, on 29 March, after employees were told that the company would no longer be operating and were offered a deal not to speak to the press.

This was in contrast to the norm which had been, and continued to be for some years afterward, characterised by small operators taking on large incumbents to take a share of their profitable routes in short term competition, and then either withdraw, fail, or be bought out by the incumbent. Industry insiders had at the time predicted however that in this case, by Christmas 1987 Badger Vectis had come very close to forcing Wilts & Dorset to cease operating entirely, had it continued with its own expansion in their territory.\n\nAlthough Badger Vectis was a failure, Badgerline itself continued its aggressive strategy, and went on to form one of the largest private transport groups in the United Kingdom, [[FirstGroup]] in June 1995.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/badgerline-links-with-grt-1614291.html Badgerline links with GRT] ''The Independent'' 5 April 1995</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/link-up-creates-second-largest-bus-group-grt-and-badgerline-in-agreed-265m-merger-1.686692 Link-up creates second largest bus group: GRT and Badgerline in agreed \u00a3265m merger] ''Herald Scotland'' 5 April 1995</ref> Both Wilts & Dorset and Southern Vectis also continued to operate, ironically coming together under common ownership, both being acquired by the [[Go-Ahead Group]], and now both operating as part of its [[Go South Coast]] division.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/aug/12/transportintheuk Bus buy for Go-Ahead] ''The Guardian'' 12 August 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.go-ahead.com/media/news/archive/2005-07-11.aspx Recommended Cash Offer for Southern Vectis plc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015001908/http://www.go-ahead.com/media/news/archive/2005-07-11.aspx |date=15 October 2013 }} Go-Ahead Group 11 July 2005</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Omnibuses blog, ''Badger Bitter'' [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2007/09/badger-bitter.html Part 1], [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2007/09/badger-bitter-pt-2.htmlPart 2], [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2008/03/badger-bitter-pt-3.html Part 3], 8 September 2007 \u2013 29 March 2008\n\n==External links==\n*[http://bcv.robsly.com/badgerv.html Gallery]\n\n{{Defunct British Bus Companies}}\n[[Category:1987 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1988 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Dorset]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox Bus transit\n|name           = Badger Vectis\n|logo           = <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: Badgerline.svg -->\n|logo_size      = 250\n|image          = \n|image_size     = \n|image_caption  = \n|company_slogan = \n|parent         = [[Badgerline]] (80%)<br>[[Southern Vectis]] (20%)\n|founded        = September 1987\n|ceased         = March 1988\n|headquarters   = [[Poole]]\n|locale         = \n|service_area   = [[Poole]] & [[Bournemouth]]\n|service_type   = Bus operator\n|hubs           = \n|stations       =\n|depots         = \n|routes         = \n|fleet           = \n|ridership      = \n|fuel_type      = \n|operator       = \n|ceo            = }}\n\n'''Badger Vectis''' was an English bus company based in [[Poole]].

It was held from Monday, December 15, 1788 to Saturday, January 10, 1789, under the new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] ratified in 1788. [[George Washington]] was unanimously elected for the first of his two terms as [[President of the United States|president]], and [[John Adams]] became the first [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. This was the only U.S. presidential election that spanned two calendar years (1788 and 1789).\n\nUnder the [[Articles of Confederation]], ratified in 1781, the United States had no [[head of state]]. Separation of the executive function of government from the legislative was incomplete, as in countries that use a [[parliamentary system]]. Federal power, strictly limited, was reserved to the [[Congress of the Confederation]], whose \"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\" was also chair of the [[Committee of the States]], which aimed to fulfill a function similar to that of the modern [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] created the offices of [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], fully separating these offices from Congress. The Constitution established an [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], based on each state's Congressional representation, in which each elector would cast two votes for two different candidates, a procedure modified in 1804 by ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Different states had varying methods for choosing presidential electors.<ref>See \"Alternative methods for choosing electors\" under [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].</ref> In 5 states, the state legislature chose electors. The other 6 chose electors through some form involving a popular vote, though in only two states did the choice depend directly on a statewide vote in a way even roughly resembling the modern method in all states.\n\nThe enormously popular Washington was distinguished as the former Commander of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After he agreed to come out of retirement, it was known that he would be elected by virtual acclaim; Washington did not select a running mate, as that concept was not yet developed.\n\nNo formal [[political party|political parties]] existed,  though an informally organized consistent difference of opinion had already manifested between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. Thus, the contest for the Vice-Presidency was open. [[Thomas Jefferson]] predicted that a popular Northern leader such as Governor [[John Hancock]] of [[Massachusetts]] or [[John Adams]], a former minister to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] who had represented Massachusetts in Congress, would be elected vice president. [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] leaders such as [[Patrick Henry]], who did not run, and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], who had opposed ratification of the Constitution, also represented potential choices.\n\nAll 69 electors cast one vote for Washington, making his election unanimous. Adams won 34 electoral votes and the vice presidency. The remaining 35 electoral votes were split among 10 different candidates, including [[John Jay]], who finished second with nine electoral votes. Washington was [[Presidency of George Washington|inaugurated]] in New York City on April 30, 1789, 57 days after the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] convened.\n\n==Candidates==\nThough no organized political parties yet existed, political opinion loosely divided between those who had more stridently and enthusiastically endorsed ratification of the Constitution, called [[Federalism in the United States#Federalism in the early Republic|Federalists]] or Cosmopolitans, and [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] or Localists who had only more reluctantly, skeptically, or conditionally supported, or who had outright opposed, ratification. Both factions supported Washington for President. Limited, primitive political campaigning occurred in states and localities where swaying public opinion might matter. For example, in [[Maryland]], a state with a statewide popular vote, unofficial parties campaigned locally, advertising platforms even in German to appeal and drive turnout by a German-speaking rural population. Organizers elsewhere lobbied through public forums, parades, and banquets.\n\n===Federalist candidates===\n{| class=wikitable\n! Candidate\n! Position\n!

Shades of yellow are for the Federalists.]]\nNo nomination process existed. The framers of the Constitution presumed that Washington would be elected unopposed. For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] spoke for national opinion when in a letter to Washington attempting to persuade him to leave retirement on his farm in [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]] to serve as the first President, he wrote that \"...the point of light in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability in which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being the head of state.\"\n\nUncertain was the choice for the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidency]], which contained no definite job description beyond being the President's designated successor while presiding over the Senate. The Constitution stipulated that the position would be awarded to the runner-up in the Presidential election. Because Washington was from Virginia, then the largest state, many assumed that electors would choose a vice president from a northern state. However, the stipulation that the President and Vice-President must be from different states dates only to the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] of 1804.  In an August 1788 letter, U.S. Minister to France [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that he considered John Adams and John Hancock, both from Massachusetts, to be the top contenders. Jefferson suggested John Jay, [[John Rutledge]], and Virginian James Madison as other possible candidates.<ref>Meacham 2012</ref> Adams received 34 electoral votes, one short of a majority - because the Constitution did not require an outright majority in the Electoral College prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to elect a runner-up as Vice President, Adams was elected to that post.\n\n[[Voter turnout]] comprised a low single-digit percentage of the adult population. Though all states allowed some rudimentary form of [[Voting rights in the United States|popular vote]], only 6 ratifying states allowed any form of popular vote specifically for Presidential electors.  In most states only white men, and in many only those who owned property, could vote. Free black men could vote in four Northern states, and women could vote in New Jersey until 1807. In some states, there was a nominal religious test for voting. For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the Congregational Church was [[Separation of church and state in the United States#Patrick Henry, Massachusetts, and Connecticut|established]], supported by taxes.  Though such tests and establishments were outlawed by the new federal Constitution, the constitution did not give the courts power to eliminate unconstitutional laws ([[Marbury v. Madison]] was not decided until 1803), and the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] did not apply to state laws until the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1868.\n\nVoting was hampered by poor communications and infrastructure and the labor demands imposed by farming. Two months passed after the election before the votes were counted and Washington was notified that he had been elected President. Washington spent one week traveling from Virginia to New York for inauguration.  Similarly, Congress took weeks to assemble.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs the electors were selected, politics intruded, and the process was not free of rumors and intrigue.  For example, Hamilton aimed to ensure that Adams did not inadvertently tie Washington in the electoral vote.<ref>Chernow, 272-273</ref> Also, Federalists spread rumors that Anti-Federalists plotted to elect [[Richard Henry Lee]] or [[Patrick Henry]] President, with [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] as vice president. However, Clinton received only three electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_George_Clinton.htm|title=VP George Clinton|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Results===\n====Popular vote====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:right\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |\n! colspan=2 | Popular Vote{{sup|(a), (b), (c)}}\n|-\n!

It was held from Monday, December 15, 1788 to Saturday, January 10, 1789, under the new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] ratified in 1788. [[George Washington]] was unanimously elected for the first of his two terms as [[President of the United States|president]], and [[John Adams]] became the first [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. This was the only U.S. presidential election that spanned two calendar years (1788 and 1789).\n\nUnder the [[Articles of Confederation]], ratified in 1781, the United States had no [[head of state]]. Separation of the executive function of government from the legislative was incomplete, as in countries that use a [[parliamentary system]]. Federal power, strictly limited, was reserved to the [[Congress of the Confederation]], whose \"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\" was also chair of the [[Committee of the States]], which aimed to fulfill a function similar to that of the modern [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. \n\nThe [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] created the offices of [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], fully separating these offices from Congress. The Constitution established an [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], based on each state's Congressional representation, in which each elector would cast two votes for two different candidates, a procedure modified in 1804 by ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Different states had varying methods for choosing presidential electors.<ref>See \"Alternative methods for choosing electors\" under [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].</ref> In 5 states, the state legislature chose electors. The other 6 chose electors through some form involving a popular vote, though in only two states did the choice depend directly on a statewide vote in a way even roughly resembling the modern method in all states.\n\nThe enormously popular Washington was distinguished as the former Commander of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After he agreed to come out of retirement, it was known that he would be elected by virtual acclaim; Washington did not select a running mate, as that concept was not yet developed.\n\nNo formal [[political party|political parties]] existed,  though an informally organized consistent difference of opinion had already manifested between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. Thus, the contest for the Vice-Presidency was open. [[Thomas Jefferson]] predicted that a popular Northern leader such as Governor [[John Hancock]] of [[Massachusetts]] or [[John Adams]], a former minister to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] who had represented Massachusetts in Congress, would be elected vice president. [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] leaders such as [[Patrick Henry]], who did not run, and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], who had opposed ratification of the Constitution, also represented potential choices.\n\nAll 69 electors cast one vote for Washington, making his election unanimous. Adams won 34 electoral votes and the vice presidency. The remaining 35 electoral votes were split among 10 different candidates, including [[John Jay]], who finished second with nine electoral votes. Washington was [[Presidency of George Washington|inaugurated]] in New York City on April 30, 1789, 57 days after the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] convened.\n\n==Candidates==\nThough no organized political parties yet existed, political opinion loosely divided between those who had more stridently and enthusiastically endorsed ratification of the Constitution, called [[Federalism in the United States#Federalism in the early Republic|Federalists]] or Cosmopolitans, and [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] or Localists who had only more reluctantly, skeptically, or conditionally supported, or who had outright opposed, ratification. Both factions supported Washington for President. Limited, primitive political campaigning occurred in states and localities where swaying public opinion might matter. For example in [[Maryland]], a state with a statewide popular vote, unofficial parties campaigned locally, advertising platforms even in German to appeal and drive turnout by a German-speaking rural population. Organizers elsewhere lobbied through public forums, parades, and banquets.\n\n===Federalist candidates===\n{| class=wikitable\n! Candidate\n! Position\n!

Shades of yellow are for the Federalists.]]\nNo nomination process existed. The framers of the Constitution presumed that Washington would be elected unopposed. For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] spoke for national opinion when in a letter to Washington attempting to persuade him to leave retirement on his farm in [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]] to serve as the first President, he wrote that \"...the point of light in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability in which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being the head of state.\" \n\nUncertain was the choice for the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidency]], which contained no definite job description beyond being the President's designated successor while presiding over the Senate. The Constitution stipulated that the position would be awarded to the runner-up in the Presidential election. Because Washington was from Virginia, then the largest state, many assumed that electors would choose a vice president from a northern state. However, the stipulation that the President and Vice-President must be from different states dates only to the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] of 1804.  In an August 1788 letter, U.S. Minister to France [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that he considered John Adams and John Hancock, both from Massachusetts, to be the top contenders. Jefferson suggested John Jay, [[John Rutledge]], and Virginian James Madison as other possible candidates.<ref>Meacham 2012</ref> Adams received 34 electoral votes, one short of a majority - because the Constitution did not require an outright majority in the Electoral College prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to elect a runner-up as Vice President, Adams was elected to that post. \n\n[[Voter turnout]] comprised a low single-digit percentage of the adult population. Though all states allowed some rudimentary form of [[Voting rights in the United States|popular vote]], only 6 ratifying states allowed any form of popular vote specifically for Presidential electors.  In most states only white men, and in many only those who owned property, could vote. Free black men could vote in four Northern states, and women could vote in New Jersey until 1807. In some states, there was a nominal religious test for voting. For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the Congregational Church was [[Separation of church and state in the United States#Patrick Henry, Massachusetts, and Connecticut|established]], supported by taxes.  Though such tests and establishments were outlawed by the new federal Constitution, the constitution did not give the courts power to eliminate unconstitutional laws ([[Marbury v. Madison]] was not decided until 1803), and the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] did not apply to state laws until the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1868. \n\nVoting was hampered by poor communications and infrastructure and the labor demands imposed by farming. Two months passed after the election before the votes were counted and Washington was notified that he had been elected President. Washington spent one week traveling from Virginia to New York for inauguration.  Similarly, Congress took weeks to assemble.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} \n\nAs the electors were selected, politics intruded, and the process was not free of rumors and intrigue.  For example, Hamilton aimed to ensure that Adams did not inadvertently tie Washington in the electoral vote.<ref>Chernow, 272-273</ref> Also, Federalists spread rumors that Anti-Federalists plotted to elect [[Richard Henry Lee]] or [[Patrick Henry]] President, with [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] as vice president. However, Clinton received only three electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_George_Clinton.htm|title=VP George Clinton|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Results===\n====Popular vote====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:right\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |\n! colspan=2 | Popular Vote{{sup|(a), (b), (c)}}\n|-\n!

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''.

Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being.

He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

The cast included Marcelo M\u00e9dici (Frank-N-Furter), Bruna Guerin (Janet Weiss), Felipe de Carolis (Brad Majors), Gottsha (Magenta and Usherette), Thiago Machado (Riff Raff), Jana Amorim (Columbia), Nicola Lama (Eddie / Dr. Everett Scott), Felipe Mafra (Rocky), Marcel Octavio (Narrator), Vanessa Costa (Ghost) and Thiago Gar\u00e7a (Ghost).\n\nThe musical was a great success, especially for the large number of cosplayers who, at the end of very show, were invited to dance \"Time Warp\" on stage with the cast.\n\nShortly before the premiere of the musical, director and producer Cl\u00e1udio Botelho became embroiled in a major controversy after posting transphobic and homophobic comments in his personal profile page on Facebook regarding trans people. In his words:\n\n\"Guys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the main role of the musical.\n\n=== Central American productions ===\n\n==== 2013 Panamanian production ====\nIn 2013 the English community [[Theatre Guild of Ancon]] presented the show under the direction of [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1754099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Melanie Gilpin] (Lee).

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

In his words:\n\n\"Guys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the main role of the musical.\n\n=== Central American productions ===\n\n==== 2013 Panamanian production ====\nIn 2013 the English community [[Theatre Guild of Ancon]] presented the show under the direction of [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1754099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Melanie Gilpin] (Lee).
