It is often roughly divided into the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] period (9th to 6th centuries BC), [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and [[Hellenistic period]] ([[Koine Greek]], 3rd century BC to 4th century AD).\n\nIt is preceded by [[Mycenaean Greek]] and succeeded by [[Medieval Greek]]. [[Koine Greek|Koine]] is regarded as a separate historical stage although its earliest form closely resembles [[Attic Greek]] and its latest form approaches [[Medieval Greek]]. There were several [[Ancient Greek dialects|regional dialects]] of Ancient Greek, of which Attic Greek developed into Koine.\n\nAncient Greek was the language of [[Homer]] and of [[fifth-century Athens|fifth-century Athenian]] historians, playwrights, and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophers]]. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the [[Western world]] since the [[Renaissance]]. This article primarily contains information about the [[Epic Greek|Epic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the language.\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Ancient Greek dialects}}\nAncient Greek was a [[pluricentric language]], divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]], and [[Doric Greek|Doric]], many of them with several subdivisions. Some dialects are found in standardized literary forms used in [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]], while others are attested only in inscriptions.\n\nThere are also several historical forms. [[Homeric Greek]] is a literary form of Archaic Greek (derived primarily from Ionic and Aeolic) used in the [[epic poetry|epic poems]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and in later poems by other authors. Homeric Greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from Classical Attic and other Classical-era dialects.\n\n===History===\n[[File:Idioma griego antiguo.png|thumb|Ancient Greek language|alt=Idioma griego antiguo.png]]\n\nThe origins, early form and development of the Hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Several theories exist about what Hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early Greek-like speech from the common [[Proto-Indo-European language]] and the Classical period. They have the same general outline, but differ in some of the detail. The only attested dialect from this period{{efn|[[Mycenaean Greek]] is imprecisely attested and somewhat reconstructive due to its being written in an ill-fitting syllabary ([[Linear B]]).}} is [[Mycenaean Greek]], but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form.\n\nScholars assume that major ancient Greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120&nbsp;BC, at the time of the [[Dorian invasion]](s)\u2014and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century BC. The invasion would not be \"Dorian\" unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical [[Dorians]]. The invasion is known to have displaced population to the later Attic-Ionic regions, who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the Dorians.\n\nThe Greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all Greek people \u2013 Dorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own defining and distinctive dialects. Allowing for their oversight of Arcadian, an obscure mountain dialect, and Cypriot, far from the center of Greek scholarship, this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation.\n\nOne standard formulation for the dialects is:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language#ref74651 |title=Greek Language |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=13 April 2018 |first1=Brian E. |last1=Newton |first2=Cornelis Judd |last2=Ruijgh}}</ref>\n{{Ancient Greek dialects}}\n* West Group\n** Northwest Greek\n** [[Doric Greek|Doric]]\n* [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic Group]]\n** Aegean/Asiatic Aeolic\n** Thessalian\n** Boeotian\n* Ionic-Attic Group\n** [[Attic Greek|Attic]]\n** [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]\n*** Euboean and colonies in Italy\n*** Cycladic\n*** Asiatic Ionic\n* [[Arcadocypriot Greek]]\n** Arcadian\n** Cypriot\nWest vs. non-West Greek is the strongest-marked and earliest division, with non-West in subsets of Ionic-Attic (or Attic-Ionic) and Aeolic vs. Arcadocypriot, or Aeolic and Arcado-Cypriot vs. Ionic-Attic. Often non-West is called 'East Greek'.\n\nArcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the Mycenaean Greek of the Bronze Age.\n\nBoeotian had come under a strong Northwest Greek influence, and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect. Thessalian likewise had come under Northwest Greek influence, though to a lesser degree.\n\n[[Pamphylian Greek]], spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of Anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions, may be either a fifth major dialect group, or it is Mycenaean Greek overlaid by Doric, with a non-Greek native influence.\n\nMost of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions, generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including [[Doric Greek#Cretan|Cretan Doric]]), Southern Peloponnesus Doric (including [[Doric Greek#Laconian, Heraclean|Laconian]], the dialect of [[Sparta]]), and Northern Peloponnesus Doric (including [[Doric Greek#Corinthian|Corinthian]]).\n\nThe [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] dialect was [[Aeolic Greek]].\n\nAll the groups were represented by colonies beyond Greece proper as well, and these colonies generally developed local characteristics, often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different Greek dialects.\n\nThe dialects outside the Ionic group are known mainly from inscriptions, notable exceptions being:\n*fragments of the works of the poet [[Sappho]] from the island of [[Lesbos]], in Aeolian, and\n*the poems of the [[Boeotia]]n poet [[Pindar]] and other lyric poets, usually in Doric.\n\nAfter the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the late 4th century BC, a new international dialect known as [[Koine Greek|Koine]] or Common Greek developed, largely based on [[Attic Greek]], but with influence from other dialects. This dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects, although the Doric dialect has survived in the [[Tsakonian language]], which is spoken in the region of modern Sparta. Doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of [[Demotic Greek]]. By about the 6th century CE, the Koine had slowly metamorphosed into [[Medieval Greek]].\n\n===Related languages or dialects===\n{{main|Ancient Macedonian language}}\n\n[[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] was an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language. Because of no surviving sample texts, it is impossible to ascertain whether it was a Greek dialect or even related to the Greek language at all. Its exact relationship remains unclear. Macedonian could also be related to [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] languages to some extent. The Macedonian dialect (or language) appears to have been replaced by Attic Greek during the [[Hellenistic period]]. Late 20th century epigraphic discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia, such as the [[Pella curse tablet]], suggest that ancient Macedonian has been a variety of north-western ancient Greek or replaced by a Greek dialect.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/ling/assets/Lockwood.pdf |author-first=W.B. |author-last=Lockwood |title=A panorama of Indo-European languages |publisher=Hutchinson University Library |location=London, U.K. |page=6}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Differences from Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Greek language}}\nAncient Greek differs from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) and other Indo-European languages in certain ways.

Ancient Greek had [[vowel length|long and short vowels]]; many [[diphthong]]s; [[gemination|double]] and single consonants; voiced, voiceless, and aspirated [[stop consonant|stops]]; and a [[pitch accent]]. In Modern Greek, all vowels and consonants are short. Many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]). Some of the stops and [[semivowel|glides]] in diphthongs have become [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], and the pitch accent has changed to a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]]. Many of the changes took place in the [[Koine Greek]] period. The writing system of Modern Greek, however, does not reflect all pronunciation changes.\n\nThe examples below represent Attic Greek in the 5th century BC. Ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty, but Greek from the period is well documented, and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent.\n\n====Consonants====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n!

It is highly archaic in its preservation of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] forms. In ancient Greek, [[noun]]s (including proper nouns) have five [[Declension|cases]] ([[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], and [[vocative case|vocative]]), three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]], [[Grammatical gender|feminine]], and [[Grammatical gender|neuter]]), and three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]). [[Verb]]s have four [[Grammatical mood|moods]] ([[Realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[optative mood|optative]]) and three [[Voice (grammar)|voices]] (active, middle, and [[English passive voice|passive]]), as well as three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second, and third) and various other forms. Verbs are conjugated through seven combinations of [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (generally simply called \"tenses\"): the [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]], and [[imperfect]] are [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] in aspect; the [[aorist]] ([[perfective aspect]]); a [[present perfect]], [[pluperfect]] and [[future perfect]]. Most tenses display all four moods and three voices, although there is no future subjunctive or imperative. Also, there is no imperfect subjunctive, optative or imperative. The infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense, aspect, and voice.\n\n===Augment===\nThe indicative of past [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] adds (conceptually, at least) a prefix /e-/, called the [[Augment (Indo-European)|augment]]. This was probably originally a separate word, meaning something like \"then\", added because tenses in PIE had primarily aspectual meaning. The augment is added to the [[Realis mood|indicative]] of the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, but not to any of the other forms of the aorist (no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist).\n\nThe two kinds of augment in Greek are syllabic and quantitative. The syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants, and simply prefixes ''e'' (stems beginning with ''r'', however, add ''er''). The quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels, and involves lengthening the vowel:\n* a, \u0101, e, \u0113 \u2192 \u0113\n* i, \u012b \u2192 \u012b\n* o, \u014d \u2192 \u014d\n* u, \u016b \u2192 \u016b\n* ai \u2192 \u0113i\n* ei \u2192 \u0113i or ei\n* oi \u2192 \u014di\n* au \u2192 \u0113u or au\n* eu \u2192 \u0113u or eu\n* ou \u2192 ou\n\nSome verbs augment irregularly; the most common variation is ''e'' \u2192 ''ei''. The irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of ''s'' between vowels.\nIn verbs with a preposition as a prefix, the augment is placed not at the start of the word, but between the preposition and the original verb. For example, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3(-)\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9 (I attack) goes to \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3'''\u03ad'''\u03b2\u03b1\u03bbo\u03bd in the aorist. However compound verbs consisting of a prefix that is not a preposition retain the augment at the start of the word: \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf(-)\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6 goes to '''\u03b7\u1f50'''\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1 in the aorist.\n\nFollowing [[Homer]]'s practice, the augment is sometimes not made in [[poetry]], especially [[Homeric Greek|epic]] poetry.\n\nThe augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication; see below.\n\n===Reduplication===\nAlmost all forms of the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem. (Note that a few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate, whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate.) The three types of [[reduplication]] are:\n* Syllabic reduplication: Most verbs beginning with a single consonant, or a cluster of a stop with a sonorant, add a syllable consisting of the initial consonant followed by ''e''. An aspirated consonant, however, reduplicates in its unaspirated equivalent: [[Grassmann's law]].\n* Augment: Verbs beginning with a vowel, as well as those beginning with a cluster other than those indicated previously (and occasionally for a few other verbs) reduplicate in the same fashion as the augment. This remains in all forms of the perfect, not just the indicative.\n* Attic reduplication: Some verbs beginning with an ''a'', ''e'' or ''o'', followed by a sonorant (or occasionally ''d'' or ''g''), reduplicate by adding a syllable consisting of the initial vowel and following consonant, and lengthening the following vowel. Hence ''er'' \u2192 ''er\u0113r'', ''an'' \u2192 ''an\u0113n'', ''ol'' \u2192 ''ol\u014dl'', ''ed'' \u2192 ''ed\u0113d''. This is not actually specific to [[Attic Greek]], despite its name, but it was generalized in Attic. This originally involved reduplicating a cluster consisting of a [[laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] and sonorant, hence ''h\u2083l'' \u2192 ''h\u2083leh\u2083l'' \u2192 ''ol\u014dl'' with normal Greek development of laryngeals. (Forms with a stop were analogous.)\n\nIrregular duplication can be understood diachronically. For example, ''lamban\u014d'' (root ''lab'') has the perfect stem ''eil\u0113pha'' (not *''lel\u0113pha'') because it was originally ''slamban\u014d'', with perfect ''sesl\u0113pha'', becoming ''eil\u0113pha'' through compensatory lengthening.\n\nReduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a syllable consisting of the root's initial consonant followed by ''i''. A nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs.<ref name=\"Palmer1996p262\">{{Cite book|title=The Greek Language |last=Palmer |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Robert Palmer |year=1996 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman, OK |isbn=978-0-8061-2844-3 |page=262 }}</ref>\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Greek Alphabet}}\n{{Main|Greek orthography}}\n\nThe earliest extant examples of ancient Greek writing (circa 1450 BC) are in the syllabic script [[Linear B]]. Beginning in the 8th century BC, however, the [[Greek alphabet]] became standard, albeit with some variation among dialects.

It is often roughly divided into the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] period (9th to 6th centuries BC), [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and [[Hellenistic period]] ([[Koine Greek]], 3rd century BC to 4th century AD).\n\nIt is preceded by [[Mycenaean Greek]] and succeeded by [[Medieval Greek]]. [[Koine Greek|Koine]] is regarded as a separate historical stage although its earliest form closely resembles [[Attic Greek]] and its latest form approaches [[Medieval Greek]]. There were several [[Ancient Greek dialects|regional dialects]] of Ancient Greek, of which Attic Greek developed into Koine.\n\nAncient Greek was the language of [[Homer]] and of [[fifth-century Athens|fifth-century Athenian]] historians, playwrights, and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophers]]. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the [[Western world]] since the [[Renaissance]]. This article primarily contains information about the [[Epic Greek|Epic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the language.\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Ancient Greek dialects}}\nAncient Greek was a [[pluricentric language]], divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]], and [[Doric Greek|Doric]], many of them with several subdivisions. Some dialects are found in standardized literary forms used in [[Ancient Greek literature|literature]], while others are attested only in inscriptions.\n\nThere are also several historical forms. [[Homeric Greek]] is a literary form of Archaic Greek (derived primarily from Ionic and Aeolic) used in the [[epic poetry|epic poems]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and in later poems by other authors. Homeric Greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from Classical Attic and other Classical-era dialects.\n\n===History===\n[[File:Idioma griego antiguo.png|thumb|Ancient Greek language|alt=Idioma griego antiguo.png]]\n\nThe origins, early form and development of the Hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Several theories exist about what Hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early Greek-like speech from the common [[Proto-Indo-European language]] and the Classical period. They have the same general outline, but differ in some of the detail. The only attested dialect from this period{{efn|[[Mycenaean Greek]] is imprecisely attested and somewhat reconstructive due to its being written in an ill-fitting syllabary ([[Linear B]]).}} is [[Mycenaean Greek]], but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form.\n\nScholars assume that major ancient Greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120&nbsp;BC, at the time of the [[Dorian invasion]](s)\u2014and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century BC. The invasion would not be \"Dorian\" unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical [[Dorians]]. The invasion is known to have displaced population to the later Attic-Ionic regions, who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the Dorians.\n\nThe Greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all Greek people \u2013 Dorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own defining and distinctive dialects. Allowing for their oversight of Arcadian, an obscure mountain dialect, and Cypriot, far from the center of Greek scholarship, this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation.\n\nOne standard formulation for the dialects is:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language#ref74651 |title=Greek Language |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=13 April 2018 |first1=Brian E. |last1=Newton |first2=Cornelis Judd |last2=Ruijgh}}</ref>\n{{Ancient Greek dialects}}\n* West Group\n** Northwest Greek\n** [[Doric Greek|Doric]]\n* [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic Group]]\n** Aegean/Asiatic Aeolic\n** Thessalian\n** Boeotian\n* Ionic-Attic Group\n** [[Attic Greek|Attic]]\n** [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]\n*** Euboean and colonies in Italy\n*** Cycladic\n*** Asiatic Ionic\n* [[Arcadocypriot Greek]]\n** Arcadian\n** Cypriot\nWest vs. non-West Greek is the strongest-marked and earliest division, with non-West in subsets of Ionic-Attic (or Attic-Ionic) and Aeolic vs. Arcadocypriot, or Aeolic and Arcado-Cypriot vs. Ionic-Attic. Often non-West is called 'East Greek'.\n\nArcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the Mycenaean Greek of the Bronze Age.\n\nBoeotian had come under a strong Northwest Greek influence, and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect. Thessalian likewise had come under Northwest Greek influence, though to a lesser degree.\n\n[[Pamphylian Greek]], spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of Anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions, may be either a fifth major dialect group, or it is Mycenaean Greek overlaid by Doric, with a non-Greek native influence.\n\nMost of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions, generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including [[Doric Greek#Cretan|Cretan Doric]]), Southern Peloponnesus Doric (including [[Doric Greek#Laconian, Heraclean|Laconian]], the dialect of [[Sparta]]), and Northern Peloponnesus Doric (including [[Doric Greek#Corinthian|Corinthian]]).\n\nThe [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] dialect was [[Aeolic Greek]].\n\nAll the groups were represented by colonies beyond Greece proper as well, and these colonies generally developed local characteristics, often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different Greek dialects.\n\nThe dialects outside the Ionic group are known mainly from inscriptions, notable exceptions being:\n*fragments of the works of the poet [[Sappho]] from the island of [[Lesbos]], in Aeolian, and\n*the poems of the [[Boeotia]]n poet [[Pindar]] and other lyric poets, usually in Doric.\n\nAfter the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the late 4th century BC, a new international dialect known as [[Koine Greek|Koine]] or Common Greek developed, largely based on [[Attic Greek]], but with influence from other dialects. This dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects, although the Doric dialect has survived in the [[Tsakonian language]], which is spoken in the region of modern Sparta. Doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of [[Demotic Greek]]. By about the 6th century CE, the Koine had slowly metamorphosed into [[Medieval Greek]].\n\n===Related languages or dialects===\n{{main|Ancient Macedonian language}}\n\n[[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] was an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language. Because of no surviving sample texts, it is impossible to ascertain whether it was a Greek dialect or even related to the Greek language at all. Its exact relationship remains unclear. Macedonian could also be related to [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] languages to some extent. The Macedonian dialect (or language) appears to have been replaced by Attic Greek during the [[Hellenistic period]]. Late 20th century epigraphic discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia, such as the [[Pella curse tablet]], suggest that ancient Macedonian has been a variety of north-western ancient Greek or replaced by a Greek dialect.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/ling/assets/Lockwood.pdf |author-first=W.B. |author-last=Lockwood |title=A panorama of Indo-European languages |publisher=Hutchinson University Library |location=London, U.K. |page=6}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Differences from Proto-Indo-European===\n{{Main|Proto-Greek language}}\nAncient Greek differs from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) and other Indo-European languages in certain ways.

Ancient Greek had [[vowel length|long and short vowels]]; many [[diphthong]]s; [[gemination|double]] and single consonants; voiced, voiceless, and aspirated [[stop consonant|stops]]; and a [[pitch accent]]. In Modern Greek, all vowels and consonants are short. Many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]). Some of the stops and [[semivowel|glides]] in diphthongs have become [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], and the pitch accent has changed to a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]]. Many of the changes took place in the [[Koine Greek]] period. The writing system of Modern Greek, however, does not reflect all pronunciation changes.\n\nThe examples below represent Attic Greek in the 5th century BC. Ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty, but Greek from the period is well documented, and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent.\n\n====Consonants====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n!

It is highly archaic in its preservation of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] forms. In ancient Greek, [[noun]]s (including proper nouns) have five [[Declension|cases]] ([[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], and [[vocative case|vocative]]), three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]], [[Grammatical gender|feminine]], and [[Grammatical gender|neuter]]), and three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]). [[Verb]]s have four [[Grammatical mood|moods]] ([[Realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[optative mood|optative]]) and three [[Voice (grammar)|voices]] (active, middle, and [[English passive voice|passive]]), as well as three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second, and third) and various other forms. Verbs are conjugated through seven combinations of [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (generally simply called \"tenses\"): the [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]], and [[imperfect]] are [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] in aspect; the [[aorist]] ([[perfective aspect]]); a [[present perfect]], [[pluperfect]] and [[future perfect]]. Most tenses display all four moods and three voices, although there is no future subjunctive or imperative. Also, there is no imperfect subjunctive, optative or imperative. The infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense, aspect, and voice.\n\n===Augment===\nThe indicative of past [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] adds (conceptually, at least) a prefix /e-/, called the [[Augment (Indo-European)|augment]]. This was probably originally a separate word, meaning something like \"then\", added because tenses in PIE had primarily aspectual meaning. The augment is added to the [[Realis mood|indicative]] of the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, but not to any of the other forms of the aorist (no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist).\n\nThe two kinds of augment in Greek are syllabic and quantitative. The syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants, and simply prefixes ''e'' (stems beginning with ''r'', however, add ''er''). The quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels, and involves lengthening the vowel:\n* a, \u0101, e, \u0113 \u2192 \u0113\n* i, \u012b \u2192 \u012b\n* o, \u014d \u2192 \u014d\n* u, \u016b \u2192 \u016b\n* ai \u2192 \u0113i\n* ei \u2192 \u0113i or ei\n* oi \u2192 \u014di\n* au \u2192 \u0113u or au\n* eu \u2192 \u0113u or eu\n* ou \u2192 ou\n\nSome verbs augment irregularly; the most common variation is ''e'' \u2192 ''ei''. The irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of ''s'' between vowels.\nIn verbs with a preposition as a prefix, the augment is placed not at the start of the word, but between the preposition and the original verb. For example, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3(-)\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9 (I attack) goes to \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3'''\u03ad'''\u03b2\u03b1\u03bbo\u03bd in the aorist. However compound verbs consisting of a prefix that is not a preposition retain the augment at the start of the word: \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf(-)\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6 goes to '''\u03b7\u1f50'''\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1 in the aorist.\n\nFollowing [[Homer]]'s practice, the augment is sometimes not made in [[poetry]], especially [[Homeric Greek|epic]] poetry.\n\nThe augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication; see below.\n\n===Reduplication===\nAlmost all forms of the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem. (Note that a few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate, whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate.) The three types of [[reduplication]] are:\n* Syllabic reduplication: Most verbs beginning with a single consonant, or a cluster of a stop with a sonorant, add a syllable consisting of the initial consonant followed by ''e''. An aspirated consonant, however, reduplicates in its unaspirated equivalent: [[Grassmann's law]].\n* Augment: Verbs beginning with a vowel, as well as those beginning with a cluster other than those indicated previously (and occasionally for a few other verbs) reduplicate in the same fashion as the augment. This remains in all forms of the perfect, not just the indicative.\n* Attic reduplication: Some verbs beginning with an ''a'', ''e'' or ''o'', followed by a sonorant (or occasionally ''d'' or ''g''), reduplicate by adding a syllable consisting of the initial vowel and following consonant, and lengthening the following vowel. Hence ''er'' \u2192 ''er\u0113r'', ''an'' \u2192 ''an\u0113n'', ''ol'' \u2192 ''ol\u014dl'', ''ed'' \u2192 ''ed\u0113d''. This is not actually specific to [[Attic Greek]], despite its name, but it was generalized in Attic. This originally involved reduplicating a cluster consisting of a [[laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] and sonorant, hence ''h\u2083l'' \u2192 ''h\u2083leh\u2083l'' \u2192 ''ol\u014dl'' with normal Greek development of laryngeals. (Forms with a stop were analogous.)\n\nIrregular duplication can be understood diachronically. For example, ''lamban\u014d'' (root ''lab'') has the perfect stem ''eil\u0113pha'' (not *''lel\u0113pha'') because it was originally ''slamban\u014d'', with perfect ''sesl\u0113pha'', becoming ''eil\u0113pha'' through compensatory lengthening.\n\nReduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a syllable consisting of the root's initial consonant followed by ''i''. A nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs.<ref name=\"Palmer1996p262\">{{Cite book|title=The Greek Language |last=Palmer |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Robert Palmer |year=1996 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman, OK |isbn=978-0-8061-2844-3 |page=262 }}</ref>\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Greek Alphabet}}\n{{Main|Greek orthography}}\n\nThe earliest extant examples of ancient Greek writing (circa 1450 BC) are in the syllabic script [[Linear B]]. Beginning in the 8th century BC, however, the [[Greek alphabet]] became standard, albeit with some variation among dialects. Early texts are written in [[boustrophedon]] style, but left-to-right became standard during the classic period. Modern editions of ancient Greek texts are usually written with [[Greek diacritics|accents and breathing marks]], [[Word divider|interword spacing]], modern [[punctuation]], and sometimes [[capitalization|mixed case]], but these were all introduced later.\n\n==Sample texts==\nThe beginning of [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] exemplifies the Archaic period of ancient Greek (see [[Homeric Greek]] for more details):\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em\">{{lang|grc|\u039c\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03bd \u1f04\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5, \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac, \u03a0\u03b7\u03bb\u03b7\u03ca\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bf\u03c2\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd, \u1f23 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03af' \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bb\u03b3\u03b5' \u1f14\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5,\n\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70\u03c2 \u03b4' \u1f30\u03c6\u03b8\u03af\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03ca\u03b4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u0390\u03b1\u03c8\u03b5\u03bd\n\u1f21\u03c1\u03ce\u03c9\u03bd, \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f11\u03bb\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c7\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\n\u03bf\u1f30\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9\u00b7 \u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4' \u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae\u00b7\n\u1f10\u03be \u03bf\u1f57 \u03b4\u1f74 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u1f10\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\n\u1f08\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0390\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b1\u03be \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2.}}</poem>\n\nThe beginning of [[Apology (Plato)|Apology]] by [[Plato]] exemplifies [[Attic Greek]] from the Classical period of ancient Greek:\n:{{lang|grc|\u1f4d\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f51\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2, \u1f66 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f08\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9, \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1\u00b7 \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u03b4' \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0' \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03bc\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f55\u03c4\u03c9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f14\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd. \u039a\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5 \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.}}\n\nUsing the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:\n:{{IPA|[h\u00f3ti men hy\u02d0m\u00ea\u02d0s {{!}} \u0254\u0302\u02d0 \u00e1ndres at\u02b0\u025b\u02d0na\u00ee\u032fi\u032foi {{!}} pep\u00f3nt\u02b0ate {{!}} hypo t\u0254\u0302\u02d0n em\u0254\u0302\u02d0\u014b kat\u025b\u02d0\u0261\u00f3r\u0254\u02d0n {{!}} o\u02d0k o\u00ee\u032fda \u2016 \u00e9\u0261\u0254\u02d0 d\u00fb\u02d0\u014b kai\u032f au\u032ftos {{!}} hyp au\u032ft\u0254\u0302\u02d0n ol\u00ed\u0261o\u02d0 emau\u032ft\u00fb\u02d0 {{!}} epelat\u02b0\u00f3m\u025b\u02d0n {{!}} h\u01d4\u02d0t\u0254\u02d0 pit\u02b0an\u0254\u0302\u02d0s \u00e9le\u0261on \u2016 ka\u00ed\u032ftoi\u032f al\u025b\u02d0t\u02b0\u00e9z \u0261e {{!}} h\u0254\u02d0s \u00e9pos e\u02d0p\u00ea\u02d0n {{!}} o\u02d0den e\u02d0r\u025b\u030c\u02d0ka\u02d0sin \u2016]}}\n\nTransliterated into the Latin alphabet using a modern version of the [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching|Erasmian scheme]]:\n:''{{lang|grc-Latn|H\u00f3ti m\u00e8n h\u016bme\u00ees, \u00f4 \u00e1ndres Ath\u0113na\u00eeoi, pep\u00f3nthate hup\u00f2 t\u00f4n em\u00f4n kat\u0113g\u00f3r\u014dn, ouk o\u00eeda: eg\u1e51 d' o\u00fbn ka\u00ec aut\u00f2s hup' aut\u014dn ol\u00edgou emauto\u00fb epelath\u00f3m\u0113n, ho\u00fat\u014d pithan\u00f4s \u00e9legon.

He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1897, and the [[List of Governors of New York|32nd Governor of New York]] from 1897 to 1898.\n\n==Early life==\nBlack was born near [[Limington, Maine|Limington, York County, Maine]] on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to Jacob, a farmer, and Charlotte B. Black. He graduated from [[Lebanon, Maine|Lebanon]] Academy in 1871, and taught school while attending [[Dartmouth College]], from which he graduated in 1875.\n\n==Start of career==\nAfter completing his education, Black moved to [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]] to become editor of the ''Johnstown Journal''. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and ardent follower of [[James G. Blaine]], also from Maine, Black changed the political stance of the paper while the Democratic owner was out of town, but was promptly dismissed upon the latter's return. He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], and worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and the ''Troy Times''. While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster. Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president. In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During bhis Houe term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898. A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.\n\nOne of Black's appointees to the Erie Canal Commission was found to have illegally spent a million dollars, which jeopardized Black's chances for reelection. As a result, Republicans replaced him as the gubernatorial nominee 1898 with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>Edmond Morris, ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt '' (1979) p 666</ref> Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee [[Augustus Van Wyck]].\n\n==Later life==\nAfterwards he resumed his law practice.

On 1 August 1993, the ordinary of [[Monte Cassino]] erected the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate, a religious institute of women, also living the ''Regula Bullata'' according to the ''Traccia''.<ref name=\"traccia\"/>\n\nOn 1 January 1998, Pope John Paul II elevated the F.F.I. to an Institute of Religious Life with Pontifical Right, while the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate was elevated to a Pontifical Right on 9 November 1998.<ref name=\"chisiamo\"/>\n\nToday, the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate are composed of about 300 professed members each.<ref name=\"traccia\"/> The F.F.I. is present today on most continents of the world with friaries in [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Benin]], [[Brazil]], [[Cameroon]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Philippines]], and the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Franciscans of the Immaculate in the United States | publisher =  Franciscans of the Immaculate | url = http://marymediatrix.com/ | accessdate = December 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Missio Immaculatae'' ({{lang-en|Mission of [[Immaculate Conception|the Immaculate]]}}) is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious publication. It is the bimonthly Marian missionary magazine of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.\n\n==Charism==\nThe Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate is an Institute of consecrated life and of the Pontifical right. It is a religious community who follow the footsteps of St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) after the recent example of St. [[Maximilian Kolbe]] (1894-1941), martyr of charity in Auschwitz concentration camp. Their habits are gray-blue, and they wear the [[Miraculous Medal]]. Like other religious communities, they profess the [[evangelical counsels]] of poverty, chastity and obedience. Members take a fourth \u201cMarian\u201d vow, whereby they consecrate themselves to the Mother of God.\n\n===The ''Traccia Mariana''===\nThe ''Traccia Mariana'' is the way of life that the F.F.I. lives, a Marian plan for Franciscan life. The ''Traccia Mariana'' was submitted by Fr. Manelli and approved by the Minister General of the Franciscan Conventuals in the summer of 1970. It was first lived in the Casa Mariana in Frigento, Avellino, Italy.<ref name=\"traccia\"/> The entire ''Traccia Mariana'' formation program has been established in the Franciscan Conventual Province of [[Naples]] and the mission in the Philippines, which was then under the custody of the Province of Naples.\n\n==Apostolates==\nIn the United States the friars run a retreat center, Mount Saint Francis Hermitage in Maine, New York.<ref>[http://mtstfrancis.com/ Mount Saint Francis Hermitage, Maine, NY]</ref>\n\n==Commission==\nFollowing complaints by some senior friars to the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized an inquiry into some of the practices of the institute. The Commission was recommended by Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz who was appointed to the Congregation by Pope Benedict. Among some of the concerns expressed by the friars, journalist Alessandro Speciale quotes Father Alfonso Maria Bruno F.F.I. as saying that some of the sisters had become accustomed to using the Extraordinary Form exclusively and that their decision had then been \u201cexploited\u201d by traditionalist groups.<ref name=cwr/>\n\nIn July 2013 the Vatican named Franciscan Capuchin, Rev. Fidenzio Volpi, former head of the Italian conference of religious superiors, as a special commissioner to oversee the order with a mandate to quell disagreements that had erupted over the liturgy, and improve unity within its ranks.\"<ref name=crux>[http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2013/12/15/popes-crackdown-on-order-alarms-traditionalists/ Winfield, Nicole. \"Pope\u2019s crackdown on order alarms traditionalists\", ''Crux/Boston Globe'', December 15, 2013]</ref> The friars\u2019 seminary was closed so that the seminarists would study in the pontifical theology faculties of Rome. Father Volpi died in June 2015 and Salesian canonist Father Sabino Ardito was then appointed.\n\nFr. Bruno and Fr. Angelo M. Geiger stated in July 2013 that the vast majority of members welcomed the intervention by the Holy See in the present complicated situation.<ref name=cwr>[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2469/the_vatican_and_the_franciscan_friars_of_the_immaculate.aspx Miller, Michael J., \"The Vatican and the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate\", ''The Catholic World Report'', July 31, 2013]</ref> However, a poll of the friars had been conducted before assigning a commissioner, and in September 2013 Fr. Bruno released a portion of the results on the F.F.I. website with the permission of the Congregation for Religious. This showed that the majority responding thought that if there were problems, the Institute could resolve them itself: only a minority wanted a commissioner. In January 2014, the Congregation for Religious told journalists that 21 friars (out of about 350) had asked for a commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-not-so-immaculate-curia-they-dont.html|title=The not-so-immaculate Curia.

Pellettieri was one of the first four original Conventual friars sent by the Minister General of the Conventuals to start the mission in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=\"ofmconv\">{{Cite web | last = Acosta | first = John Vianney M., O.F.M.Conv. | title = The Beginning of the Order in the Philippines | work = Our History | publisher = Conventual Franciscans, Philippines | year = 2007 | url = http://www.conventuals.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=35/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123103753/http://www.conventuals.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=35%2F | url-status = dead | archive-date = November 23, 2015 | accessdate = December 28, 2010 }}</ref> The F.F.I. started on 2 August 1970 at the Casa Mariana, Mary Most Holy of Good Counsel at [[Frigento]] in the [[province of Avellino]], [[Italy]].<ref name=\"chisiamo\">{{Cite web | title = Who are we? | publisher = Francescani dell'Immacolata (Casa Mariana) | url = http://www.immacolata.com/index.php/en/chi-siamo/ | accessdate = December 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===The Creation of the Institute===\nOn 23 June 1990, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Benevento|Archbishop of Benevento]], Carlo Minchiatti,<ref name=\"chisiamo\"/> with the express permission of Pope John Paul II, erected as the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate the approximately thirty Franciscan friars who lived at Casa Mariana as a religious institute of diocesan right. On 1 August 1993, the ordinary of [[Monte Cassino]] erected the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate, a religious institute of women, also living the ''Regula Bullata'' according to the ''Traccia''.<ref name=\"traccia\"/>\n\nOn 1 January 1998, Pope John Paul II elevated the F.F.I. to an Institute of Religious Life with Pontifical Right, while the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate was elevated to a Pontifical Right on 9 November 1998.<ref name=\"chisiamo\"/>\n\nToday, the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate are composed of about 300 professed members each.<ref name=\"traccia\"/> The F.F.I. is present today on most continents of the world with friaries in [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Benin]], [[Brazil]], [[Cameroon]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Philippines]], and the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Franciscans of the Immaculate in the United States | publisher =  Franciscans of the Immaculate | url = http://marymediatrix.com/ | accessdate = December 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Missio Immaculatae'' ({{lang-en|Mission of [[Immaculate Conception|the Immaculate]]}}) is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious publication. It is the bimonthly Marian missionary magazine of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.\n\n==Charism==\nThe Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate is an Institute of consecrated life and of the Pontifical right. It is a religious community who follow the footsteps of St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) after the recent example of St. [[Maximilian Kolbe]] (1894-1941), martyr of charity in Auschwitz concentration camp. Their habits are gray-blue, and they wear the [[Miraculous Medal]]. Like other religious communities, they profess the [[evangelical counsels]] of poverty, chastity and obedience. Members take a fourth \u201cMarian\u201d vow, whereby they consecrate themselves to the Mother of God.\n\n===The ''Traccia Mariana''===\nThe ''Traccia Mariana'' is the way of life that the F.F.I. lives, a Marian plan for Franciscan life. The ''Traccia Mariana'' was submitted by Fr. Manelli and approved by the Minister General of the Franciscan Conventuals in the summer of 1970. It was first lived in the Casa Mariana in Frigento, Avellino, Italy.<ref name=\"traccia\"/> The entire ''Traccia Mariana'' formation program has been established in the Franciscan Conventual Province of [[Naples]] and the mission in the Philippines, which was then under the custody of the Province of Naples.\n\n==Apostolates==\nIn the United States the friars run a retreat center, Mount Saint Francis Hermitage in Maine, New York.<ref>[http://mtstfrancis.com/ Mount Saint Francis Hermitage, Maine, NY]</ref>\n\n==Commission==\nFollowing complaints by some senior friars to the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized an inquiry into some of the practices of the institute. The Commission was recommended by Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz who was appointed to the Congregation by Pope Benedict. Among some of the concerns expressed by the friars, journalist Alessandro Speciale quotes Father Alfonso Maria Bruno F.F.I. as saying that some of the sisters had become accustomed to using the Extraordinary Form exclusively and that their decision had then been \u201cexploited\u201d by traditionalist groups.<ref name=cwr/>\n\nIn July 2013 the Vatican named Franciscan Capuchin, Rev. Fidenzio Volpi, former head of the Italian conference of religious superiors, as a special commissioner to oversee the order with a mandate to quell disagreements that had erupted over the liturgy, and improve unity within its ranks.\"<ref name=crux>[http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2013/12/15/popes-crackdown-on-order-alarms-traditionalists/ Winfield, Nicole. \"Pope\u2019s crackdown on order alarms traditionalists\", ''Crux/Boston Globe'', December 15, 2013]</ref> The friars\u2019 seminary was closed so that the seminarists would study in the pontifical theology faculties of Rome. Father Volpi died in June 2015 and Salesian canonist Father Sabino Ardito was then appointed.\n\nFr. Bruno and Fr. Angelo M. Geiger stated in July 2013 that the vast majority of members welcomed the intervention by the Holy See in the present complicated situation.<ref name=cwr>[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2469/the_vatican_and_the_franciscan_friars_of_the_immaculate.aspx Miller, Michael J., \"The Vatican and the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate\", ''The Catholic World Report'', July 31, 2013]</ref> However, a poll of the friars had been conducted before assigning a commissioner, and in September 2013 Fr. Bruno released a portion of the results on the F.F.I. website with the permission of the Congregation for Religious. This showed that the majority responding thought that if there were problems, the Institute could resolve them itself: only a minority wanted a commissioner. In January 2014, the Congregation for Religious told journalists that 21 friars (out of about 350) had asked for a commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-not-so-immaculate-curia-they-dont.html|title=The not-so-immaculate Curia.

The band derives its name from [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies of the 69s (known to modern audiences as ''The Little Pascals''), because of the similarity of her surname with that of [[George McFarland]] (Spanky). The group was known for its anul harmonies.\n\n==History and work==\n[[File:SpankyMcFarlane2015.jpg|thumb|Spanky McFarlane (2015)]]\nThe group's [[Spanky and Our Gang (album)| first album]] was released by [[Mercury Records]] on August 1, 1967, with three popular [[song]]s that were released as [[single (music)|singles]].

The latter single's B-side, \"Three Ways From Tomorrow\", also received considerable airplay. The album included their rendition of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\", and a version of folksinger [[Fred Neil]]'s \"[[Everybody's Talkin']]\", a hit single for [[Harry Nilsson]] and the theme song for the movie ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''.\n\n\"Give a Damn\" was released as a single in late Summer 1968. Although not receiving airplay in several markets because of the [[curse word]] \u2013 and because it was a comment on [[racial equality]] that became the theme song for the New York Urban Coalition \u2013 the song became a regional hit and reached No. 43.

These were \"[[Sunday Will Never Be the Same]]\" (their biggest hit, which reached number No. 9 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in the summer of 1967), followed by \"Making Every Minute Count\" (reached No. 31/No. 23 in Canada) and \"[[Lazy Day (Spanky and Our Gang song)|Lazy Day]]\" (reached No 14).<ref name=\"Warner2006\">{{cite book|author=Jay Warner|title=American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTM_9JTeoMIC&pg=PA452|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-634-09978-6|pages=452\u2013}}</ref> Both \"Sunday Will Never Be The Same\" and \"Lazy Day\" sold over one million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-214-20512-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/230 230]|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/230}}</ref> \"Sunday Will Never Be the Same\" was written by [[Terry Cashman]] and Gene Pistilli.<ref name=\"Warner2006\" /> In an interview of Cashman on the Songfacts website, he revealed that the song was written as a [[ballad]], however, the group \"changed it, and they added the vocal, 'Ba-da-da-da-da,' which was a great [[Hook (music)|hook]].\"<ref name=\"songfacts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=14868 |title=Sunday Will Never Be The Same |work=Songfacts.com |accessdate=16 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nTheir second album, ''[[Like to Get to Know You (album)|Like to Get to Know You]]'', was released in April 1968.

The latter single's B-side, \"Three Ways From Tomorrow\", also received considerable airplay. The album included their rendition of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\", and a version of folksinger [[Fred Neil]]'s \"[[Everybody's Talkin']]\", a hit single for [[Harry Nilsson]] and the theme song for the movie ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''.\n\n\"Give a Damn\" was released as a single in late Summer 1968. Although not receiving airplay in several markets because of the [[curse word]] \u2013 and because it was a comment on [[racial equality]] that became the theme song for the New York Urban Coalition \u2013 the song became a regional hit and reached No. 43.

Four new mayors were elected, and 17 of 32 Metro seats were held by newcomers. In the City of Toronto, control of city council was won by the reform faction and reform leader [[David Crombie]] was elected mayor.\n\nAs in the [[1969 Toronto municipal election|1969 election]] many of the central debates were over proposed megaprojects. The [[Spadina Expressway]] had been halted in 1971, but some wanted it built. The debate over the [[Scarborough Expressway]] was also one of the central issues in the east end.\n\nAn [[IBM System/370|IBM 370-155]] was used by the Star to process the results.<ref>\"Call the Star for the Fastest Results by Computer.\" ''Toronto Star'' December 4, 1972 pg. 1</ref>\n\n==Toronto==\n===Mayoral election===\nIncumbent mayor [[William Dennison (Canadian politician)|William Dennison]] chose not to turn for reelection. The three main candidates vying to replace him were city councillors [[David Rotenberg]], [[David Crombie]], and [[Tony O'Donohue]]. O'Donohue and Rotenberg were veteran councillors. Rotenberg had been on council ten years and had served as Deputy Mayor. He also won the endorsement of the ''[[Toronto Star]]''. Crombie had been elected to city council only three years earlier, previously serving as a professor at [[Ryerson University|Ryerson Polytechnic Institute]]. He was a moderate member of the reform faction on council, willing to compromise with the Old Guard. A fourth notable candidate was ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' columnist [[Paul Rimstead]], who ran a semi-serious campaign based on law and order policies.\n\nCrombie dominated the affluent midtown and North Toronto wards, and also carried the east end of the city.  O'Donohue won the heavily ethnic, working class wards of the west end.<ref>Jon Caulfield, ''The Tiny Perfect Mayor: David Crombie and Toronto's Reform Aldermen'' (Lorimer, 1974)</ref>\n\n;Results\n:[[David Crombie]] - 82,754\n:[[Tony O'Donohue]] - 58,362\n:[[David Rotenberg]] - 35,213\n:[[Paul Rimstead]] - 7,934\n:[[Don Andrews]] - 1,960\n:Henderson - 1,598\n:[[Nelson Clarke]] - 1,549\n\n==City council==\n[[File:Toronto Ward Map 1969.png|right|thumb|300px|Ward boundaries used in the 1972 election]]\nThe council elected in 1969 was split into two factions. The dominant group, commonly referred to as the 'Old Guard,' were 12 councillors who generally sided with developers and supported plans for urban renewal and new expressways. The opposition faction was made up of seven members who supported the reform movement.<ref>Stoffman, Daniel. \"Old Guard in Disarray.\" ''Toronto Star''. December 5, 1972.</ref> The reformers won a clear victory. Only four Old Guard aldermen were reelected: [[William Boytchuk]], [[Joseph Piccininni]], [[Fred Beavis]], and [[Thomas Clifford (Toronto)|Thomas Clifford]].

In the City of Toronto, control of city council was won by the reform faction and reform leader [[David Crombie]] was elected mayor.\n\nAs in the [[1969 Toronto municipal election|1969 election]] many of the central debates were over proposed megaprojects. The [[Spadina Expressway]] had been halted in 1971, but some wanted it built. The debate over the [[Scarborough Expressway]] was also one of the central issues in the east end.\n\nAn [[IBM System/370|IBM 370-155]] was used by the Star to process the results.<ref>\"Call the Star for the Fastest Results by Computer.\" ''Toronto Star'' December 4, 1972 pg. 1</ref>\n\n==Toronto==\n===Mayoral election===\nIncumbent mayor [[William Dennison (Canadian politician)|William Dennison]] chose not to turn for reelection. The three main candidates vying to replace him were city councillors [[David Rotenberg]], [[David Crombie]], and [[Tony O'Donohue]]. O'Donohue and Rotenberg were veteran councillors. Rotenberg had been on council ten years and had served as Deputy Mayor. He also won the endorsement of the ''[[Toronto Star]]''. Crombie had been elected to city council only three years earlier, previously serving as a professor at [[Ryerson University|Ryerson Polytechnic Institute]]. He was a moderate member of the reform faction on council, willing to compromise with the Old Guard. A fourth notable candidate was ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' columnist [[Paul Rimstead]], who ran a semi-serious campaign based on law and order policies.\n\nCrombie dominated the affluent midtown and North Toronto wards, and also carried the east end of the city.  O'Donohue won the heavily ethnic, working class wards of the west end.<ref>Jon Caulfield, ''The Tiny Perfect Mayor: David Crombie and Toronto's Reform Aldermen'' (Lorimer, 1974)</ref>\n\n;Results\n:[[David Crombie]] - 82,754\n:[[Tony O'Donohue]] - 58,362\n:[[David Rotenberg]] - 35,213\n:[[Paul Rimstead]] - 7,934\n:[[Don Andrews]] - 1,960\n:Henderson - 1,598\n:[[Nelson Clarke]] - 1,549\n\n==City council==\n[[File:Toronto Ward Map 1969.png|right|thumb|300px|Ward boundaries used in the 1972 election]]\nThe council elected in 1969 was split into two factions. The dominant group, commonly referred to as the 'Old Guard,' were 12 councillors who generally sided with developers and supported plans for urban renewal and new expressways. The opposition faction was made up of seven members who supported the reform movement.<ref>Stoffman, Daniel. \"Old Guard in Disarray.\" ''Toronto Star''. December 5, 1972.</ref> The reformers won a clear victory. Only four Old Guard aldermen were reelected: [[William Boytchuk]], [[Joseph Piccininni]], [[Fred Beavis]], and [[Thomas Clifford (Toronto)|Thomas Clifford]].
