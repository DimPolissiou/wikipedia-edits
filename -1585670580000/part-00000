It is located in the grounds of the [[All Saints Pastoral centre]], part of the [[Archdiocese of Westminster]], in [[London Colney]], [[Hertfordshire]].\n\nChantry Island is famous as being the arrest place of [[Saint Alban]], the first [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Martyr]] in the United Kingdom. Saint Alban had been recently converted by a priest. Chantry Island was, and is, heavily wooded, and provided an ideal location for clandestine meetings of local Christians, since should the local Roman Authorities appear, it provided much cover for the Christians to scatter and hide. On the occasion of his arrest, a group of Christians were meeting when they got word of the impending arrival of Roman Soldiers. Saint Alban offered to swap clothes with the priest so that he himself, and not the priest, would be arrested. Saint Alban was arrested, marched to nearby [[Verulamium]], where he would later be [[martyred]].  [[Verulamium]] was later renamed Saint Albans in his honor.\n\nChantry Island became a site of [[pilgrimage]], and there exists to this day the remains of a chapel built on the site to commemorate Saint Alban's arrest.\n\n[[Category:Catholic pilgrimage sites]]\n[[Category:History of Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Geography of Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in England and Wales]]\n", "name_user": "GaryGMason", "label": "safe", "comment": "More accurate description of Chantry Island; cleaning up the grammar; highlight speculation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantry_Island,_Hertfordshire"}

The state included a [[List of Ismaili castles|nexus of strategic fortresses]] throughout [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], with each stronghold being surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, in particular, the [[Seljuk Empire]].\n\nThe order of the Assassins was formed as a result of a religious and political movement of the minority [[Nizari Ismaili]] sect supported by the anti-Seljuk population. Being heavily outnumbered, they resisted adversaries by employing strategic strongholds and the use of unconventional tactics, such as [[assassination]] of important figures and psychological warfare.\n\nTwo centuries after its foundation, the state declined internally under [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]], who eventually dismantled and surrendered the Alamut Castle to the [[Mongol Empire|invading Mongols]]. Much of what is known about the Nizaris are based on hostile sources.\n\n==History==\nMost [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Shia]]s outside North Africa, mostly in Persia and Syria, came to acknowledge [[Nizar ibn al-Mustansir]]'s claim to the Imamate as maintained by [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]], and this point marks the fundamental split between Ismaili Shias. Within two generations, the [[Fatimid Empire]] would suffer several more splits and eventually implode.\n[[File:Alamut.png|thumb|300px|left|Location of several of the [[List of Ismaili castles|Ismaili castles]] in the regions of [[Alamut]] and [[Rudbar]] of Persia]]\nFollowing his expulsion from Egypt over his support for Nizar, Hassan-i Sabbah found that his co-religionists, the Ismailis, were scattered throughout Persia, with a strong presence in the northern and eastern regions, particularly in [[Daylam]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and [[Quhistan]]. The Ismailis and other occupied peoples of Persia held shared resentment for the ruling [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s, who had divided the country's farmland into ''[[Iqta'|iqt\u0101\u2019]]'' (fiefs) and levied heavy taxes upon the citizens living therein.

The governor (''muhtasham'') of Quhistan was [[Nasir al-Din Abu al-Fath Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur]], and the Nizaris were under Imam [[Ala' al-Din Muhammad]].<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nAfter the death of the last Khwarezmaian ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the destruction of the[Nizari Ismaili state and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] became thet main Mongol objectives. In 1238, the Nizari Imam and the Abbasid caliph sent a joint diplomatic mission to the European kings [[Louis IX of France]] and [[Edward I of England]] to forge an alliance against the invading Mongols, but this was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2zsef |last3=Studies |first3=Central European University Dept of Medieval |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |date=2001 |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=978-963-9241-42-8 |page=32 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Daftari2000\" /> The Mongols kept putting pressure on the Nizris of [[Quhistan]] and [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]]. In 1256, Ala' al-Din was succeeded by his young son [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]] as the Nizari Imam. A year later, the main Mongol army under [[Hulagu Khan]] enter Iran via Khorasan. Numerous negotiations between the Nizari Imam and Hulagu Khan were futile. Apparently, the Nizari Imam seeked to at least keep the main Nizari strongohlds, while the Mongols demanded the full submission of the Nizaris.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nIn 19 November 1256, the Nizari Imam, who was in the [[Maymun-Dizh]], surrendered the castle to the besieging Mongols under Hulagu Khan after a fierce conflict. [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] fell in December 1256 and [[Lambasar Castle|Lambsar]] fell in 1257, with [[Gerdkuh Castle|Gerdkuh]] remaining unconqured. In the same year, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], the khagan of the [[Mongol Empire]], ordered a massacre of all Nizari Ismailis of Persia. Rukn al-Din Khurshah himself, who had travelled to mainland [[Mongolia]] to meet M\u00f6ngke Khan, was killed by his personal Mongol guard. Gerdkuh castle finally fell in 1270, becoming the last Nizari stronghold in Persia to be conquered.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nThus the centralized government of the Nizaris was disestablished, and Nizaris were either killed or abandoned their traditional strongholds. Many of them migrated to [[Afghanistan]], [[Badakhshan]], and [[Sindh]].

Positioned atop a narrow rock base approximately 180 meters above ground level, the fortress could not be taken by direct military force.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|27}} To the east, the Alamut valley is bordered by a mountainous range called [[Alamkuh]] (The Throne of Solomon) between which the [[Alamut River]] flows. The valley's western entrance is a narrow one, shielded by cliffs over 350m high. Known as the [[Shirkuh]], the gorge sits at the intersection of three rivers: the [[Taliqan]], [[Shahrud]] and Alamut River. For much of the year, the raging waters of the river made this entrance nearly inaccessible. Qazvin, the closest town to the valley by land can only be reached by an underdeveloped mule track upon which an enemy's presence could easily be detected given the dust clouds arising from their passage.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|58}} But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of [[Lambsar Castle|Lamasar]] served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name ''[[dar al-hijra]]'' (place of refuge). The notion of the ''dar al-hijra'' originates from the time of the Prophet Muhammad, who fled with his supporters from intense persecution to safe haven in [[Yathrib]].<ref name=\"Secret Order\">{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G.S. |title=The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Niz\u00e2r\u00ee Ism\u00e2'\u00eel\u00ees Against the Islamic World |year=2005 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780812219166}}</ref>{{rp|79}} In this way, the [[Fatimid]]s found their ''dar al-hijra'' in [[North Africa]].

For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270\u201373 when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] annexed them.

One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}} Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends.  In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by commandos called ''fid\u0101\u2019\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc}}, \"devotee\"; plural {{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648\u0646}} ''fid\u0101\u2019iyy\u016bn'').  The assassinations were against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|61}} A single assassination was usually employed in favour of widespread bloodshed resultant from factional combat. The first instance of assassination in the effort to establish an Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the murder of Seljuq vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]].<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}} Carried out by a man dressed as a [[Sufi]] whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the fida\u2019is have been significantly exaggerated.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}}  While the Seljuqs and [[Crusaders]] both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n[[Knives]] and [[dagger]]s were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that he was marked for death.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Nizari Ismailism]]\n* [[List of assassinations by the Assassins]]\n* [[Order of Assassins]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Willey, Peter.

The state included a [[List of Ismaili castles|nexus of strategic fortresses]] throughout [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], with each stronghold being surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, in particular, the [[Seljuk Empire]].\n\nThe order of the Assassins was formed as a result of a religious and political movement of the minority [[Nizari Ismaili]] sect supported by the anti-Seljuk population. Being heavily outnumbered, they resisted adversaries by employing strategic strongholds and the use of unconventional tactics, such as [[assassination]] of important figures and psychological warfare.\n\nTwo centuries after its foundation, the state declined internally under [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]], who eventually dismantled and surrendered the Alamut Castle to the [[Mongol Empire|invading Mongols]]. Much of what is known about the Nizaris are based on hostile sources.\n\n==History==\nMost [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Shia]]s outside North Africa, mostly in Persia and Syria, came to acknowledge [[Nizar ibn al-Mustansir]]'s claim to the Imamate as maintained by [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]], and this point marks the fundamental split between Ismaili Shias. Within two generations, the [[Fatimid Empire]] would suffer several more splits and eventually implode.\n[[File:Alamut.png|thumb|300px|left|Location of several of the [[List of Ismaili castles|Ismaili castles]] in the regions of [[Alamut]] and [[Rudbar]] of Persia]]\nFollowing his expulsion from Egypt over his support for Nizar, Hassan-i Sabbah found that his co-religionists, the Ismailis, were scattered throughout Persia, with a strong presence in the northern and eastern regions, particularly in [[Daylam]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and [[Quhistan]]. The Ismailis and other occupied peoples of Persia held shared resentment for the ruling [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s, who had divided the country's farmland into ''[[Iqta'|iqt\u0101\u2019]]'' (fiefs) and levied heavy taxes upon the citizens living therein. The Seljuk ''[[amirs]]'' (independent rulers) usually held full jurisdiction and control over the districts they administered.<ref name=\"Short History\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9781558761933}}</ref>{{rp|126}} Meanwhile, Persian artisans, craftsmen and lower classes grew increasingly dissatisfied with the Seljuk policies and heavy taxes.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|126}} Hassan too, was appalled by the political and economic oppression imposed by the [[Sunni]] Seljuk ruling class on [[Shi'ite]] Muslims living across Persia.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|126}}  It was in this context that he embarked on a resistance movement against the Seljuqs, beginning with the search for a secure site from which to launch his revolt.\n\nBy 1090 AD, the Seljuk vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] had already given orders for Hassan's arrest and therefore Hassan was living in hiding in the northern town of [[Qazvin]], approximately 60&nbsp;km from the Alamut Castle.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\">{{cite book |last=Willey |first=Peter |title=Eagle's Nest: Ismaili Castles in Iran and Syria |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

The castle had never before been captured by military means and thus Hassan planned meticulously.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}} Meanwhile, he dispatched his reliable supporters to the Alamut valley to begin settlements around the castle.\n\nIn the summer of 1090 AD, Hassan set out from Qazvin towards Alamut on a mountainous route through [[Andej]]. He remained at Andej disguised as a schoolteacher named Dehkhoda until he was certain that a number of his supporters had settled directly below the castle in the village of [[Gazorkhan]] or had gained employment at the fortress itself.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}} Still in disguise, Hassan made his way into the fortress, earning the trust and friendship of many of its soldiers. Careful not to attract the attention of the castle's [[Zaydi]] lord, Mahdi, Hassan began to attract prominent figures at Alamut to his mission. It has even been suggested that Mahdi's own deputy was a secret supporter of Hassan, waiting to demonstrate his loyalty on the day that Hassan would ultimately take the castle.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}}\nThe Alamut fortress was eventually captured from Mahdi in 1090 AD and therefore from Seljuk control by Hassan and his supporters without resorting to any violence.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|24}} Mahdi's life was spared, and he later received 3,000 gold dinars in compensation.\nCapturing of the Alamut Castle marks the founding of the Nizari Ismaili state.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]] and the succeeding lords of Alamut, the strategy of covert capture was successfully replicated at strategic fortresses across Persia, Syria, and the Fertile Crescent.  The Nizari Ismaili created a state of unconnected fortresses, surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, and managed a unified power structure that proved more effective than either that in Fatimid Cairo, or Seljuk Bagdad, both of which suffered political instability, particularly during the transition between leaders. These periods of internal turmoil allowed the Ismaili state respite from attack, and even to have such sovereignty as to have minted their own coinage.\n{{quote box|align=right|width=26%|quote=\"They call him Shaykh-al-Hashishim.

The governor (''muhtasham'') of Quhistan was [[Nasir al-Din Abu al-Fath Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur]], and the Nizaris were under Imam [[Ala' al-Din Muhammad]].<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nAfter the death of the last Khwarezmaian ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the destruction of the[Nizari Ismaili state and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] became thet main Mongol objectives. In 1238, the Nizari Imam and the Abbasid caliph sent a joint diplomatic mission to the European kings [[Louis IX of France]] and [[Edward I of England]] to forge an alliance against the invading Mongols, but this was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2zsef |last3=Studies |first3=Central European University Dept of Medieval |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |date=2001 |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=978-963-9241-42-8 |page=32 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Daftari2000\" /> The Mongols kept putting pressure on the Nizris of [[Quhistan]] and [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]]. In 1256, Ala' al-Din was succeeded by his young son [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]] as the Nizari Imam. A year later, the main Mongol army under [[Hulagu Khan]] enter Iran via Khorasan. Numerous negotiations between the Nizari Imam and Hulagu Khan were futile. Apparently, the Nizari Imam seeked to at least keep the main Nizari strongohlds, while the Mongols demanded the full submission of the Nizaris.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nIn 19 November 1256, the Nizari Imam, who was in the [[Maymun-Dizh]], surrendered the castle to the besieging Mongols under Hulagu Khan after a fierce conflict. [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] fell in December 1256 and [[Lambasar Castle|Lambsar]] fell in 1257, with [[Gerdkuh Castle|Gerdkuh]] remaining unconqured. In thte same year, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], the khagan of the [[Mongol Empire]], ordered a massacre of all Nizari Ismailis of Persia. Rukn al-Din Khurshah himself, who had travelled to mainland [[Mongolia]] to meet M\u00f6ngke Khan, was killed by his personal Mongol guard. Gerdkuh castle finally fell in 1270, becoming the last Nizari stronghold in Persia to be conquered.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nThus the centralized government of the Nizaris was disestablished, and Nizaris were either killed or abandoned their traditional strongholds. Many of them migrated to [[Afghanistan]], [[Badakhshan]], and [[Sindh]].

Qazvin, the closest town to the valley by land can only be reached by an underdeveloped mule track upon which an enemy's presence could easily be detected given the dust clouds arising from their passage.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|58}} But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of [[Lambsar Castle|Lamasar]] served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name ''[[dar al-hijra]]'' (place of refuge). The notion of the ''dar al-hijra'' originates from the time of the Prophet Muhammad, who fled with his supporters from intense persecution to safe haven in [[Yathrib]].<ref name=\"Secret Order\">{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G.S. |title=The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Niz\u00e2r\u00ee Ism\u00e2'\u00eel\u00ees Against the Islamic World |year=2005 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780812219166}}</ref>{{rp|79}} In this way, the [[Fatimid]]s found their ''dar al-hijra'' in [[North Africa]]. Likewise during the revolt against the Seljuqs, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Ismailis.\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|262px|Map of the [[Hashashins]] in the [[Near East]] and their neighbors]]\nDuring the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains|Nusayriyah Mountain Range]] in coastal Syria, including [[Masyaf]], Rusafa, [[al-Kahf]], [[al-Qadmus]], [[Khawabi]], [[Sarmin]], Quliya, Ulayqa, Maniqa, [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]] and [[Harim Mountains|Jabal al-Summaq]]. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270\u201373 when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt.<ref>Raphael, 2011, p. 106.</ref> From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.<ref>Daftary, 2007, p. 402.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Qazvin - Alamout Castle3.jpg|[[Alamut Castle]], Persia\nImage:Lambesar 2.jpg|[[Lambsar Castle]], Persia\nImage:\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u062f\u062e\u0627\u06461.jpg|[[Rudkhan Castle]], Persia\n\nImage:Masyaf2.jpg|[[Masyaf Castle]], Syria\nImage:Abu Qubeis2.jpg|[[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]], Syria\nImage:Fortress of Qalat el-Mudiq.jpg|[[Qalaat al-Madiq]], Syria\n</gallery>\n\n===Assassination===\n{{main|Order of Assassins|List of assassinations by the Assassins}}\nIn pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Ismailis adopted various military strategies popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}} Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends.  In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by commandos called ''fid\u0101\u2019\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc}}, \"devotee\"; plural {{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648\u0646}} ''fid\u0101\u2019iyy\u016bn'').  The assassinations were against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|61}} A single assassination was usually employed in favour of widespread bloodshed resultant from factional combat. The first instance of assassination in the effort to establish an Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the murder of Seljuq vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]].<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}} Carried out by a man dressed as a [[Sufi]] whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the fida\u2019is have been significantly exaggerated.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}}  While the Seljuqs and [[Crusaders]] both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n[[Knives]] and [[dagger]]s were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that he was marked for death.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Nizari Ismailism]]\n* [[List of assassinations by the Assassins]]\n* [[Order of Assassins]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Willey, Peter.

He served in [[World War II]] as a communications sergeant in a rifle company of the [[102nd Infantry Division (United States)|102nd Infantry Division]]; during the war, he was wounded twice. His second wound, a shrapnel wound in his leg received near the [[Elbe River]] at the end of the war, left him disabled for life.\n\nAfter the war, Biggle resumed his education. He received an A.B. Degree with High Distinction from [[Wayne State University]] and M.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the [[University of Michigan]]. Biggle taught at the University of Michigan and at [[Eastern Michigan University]] in the 1950s. He began writing professionally in 1955 and became a full-time writer with the publication of his novel, ''All the Colors of Darkness'' in 1963; he continued in the writing profession until his death.\n\n==Career==\nBiggle was celebrated in science fiction circles as the author who introduced [[aesthetics]] into a literature known for its scientific and technological complications. His stories frequently used musical and artistic themes. Such notables as songwriter [[Jimmy Webb]] and novelist [[Orson Scott Card]] have written of the tremendous effect that his early story, \"The Tunesmith\", had on them in their youth. Among Biggle's enduring science fiction creations were the matter-transmission trouble-shooting team of Jan Darzek/Effie Schlupe, and the Cultural Survey, featured in novels and magazine stories, through which Biggle explored issues of multi-culturalism and technology.\n\nIn the field of mystery writing, Biggle's ''Grandfather Rastin'' stories appeared for many years in ''[[Ellery Queen]]'s Mystery Magazine''. He loved writing historical fiction set in late Victorian and Edwardian England. He wrote a series of new [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories from the perspective of Edward Porter Jones, an assistant who began his association with Holmes as a \"Baker Street Irregular\"; several stories, including \"The Quallsford Inheritance\" and \"The Glendower Conspiracy\", feature Jones and Holmes. These were followed by a series of stories featured in ''[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s Mystery Magazine'' starring Biggle's Victorian sleuth, Lady Sara Varnley.\n\nBoth Biggle's [[science fiction]] and mystery stories have received international acclaim, being nominated for the 1962 Hugo for short fiction, and also for the Locus Readers awards in 1972, 1973, and 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfadb.com/Lloyd_Biggle_Jr|title=Science Fiction Awards Database|accessdate=Jan 7, 2016}}</ref> He published two-dozen books as well as magazine stories and numerous articles.

Although Bruckner had been composing sonata-form movements with three distinct themes since he began writing symphonies in 1862, in 1872 he greatly expanded the scope of their presentation and development, and established the framework, which he would use consistently in all of his subsequent symphonic work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carragan.com/composer-anton-bruckner/second-symphony-studies/|title=Second Symphony Studies|first=William|last=Carragan}}</ref> Moreover, the Adagio of this symphony is in ABA\u2032B\u2032A\u2033 ''Lied'' form followed by a coda \u2013 the framework which Bruckner would use in his subsequent symphonic work, with exception of the [[Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)|Sixth]].<ref name=\"brand2\"/>\n\nThe Second Symphony is the only numbered Bruckner symphony without a dedication; [[Franz Liszt]] tacitly rejected the dedication, and [[Richard Wagner]] chose the [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3 in D minor]] when offered both works. The symphony was planned to be performed in the same year by the Vienna Philharmonic under [[Felix Otto Dessoff|Otto Dessoff]]. However, the rehearsal did not lead to a performance, because Dessoff and a number of players considered it impossible to perform. Nevertheless, the symphony was premiered the following year, on 26 October 1873, by the Vienna Philharmonic with Bruckner himself on the podium.\n\n== Description ==\nThe score calls for a pair each of [[flute]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[timpani]], and [[string instrument|strings]].\n\nThe symphony has four [[movement (music)|movements]]. In the first version (1872) they are:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman \n|Allegro: ''Ziemlich schnell'' (C minor)\n|Scherzo (C minor) \u2013 Trio (C major)\n|Adagio (A{{flat}} major)\n|Finale (C minor)\n}}\nIn the second version (1877) they are:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Moderato\n|Andante: ''Feierlich, etwas bewegt''\n|Scherzo: ''M\u00e4\u00dfig schnell'' \u2013 Trio: ''Gleiches tempo''\n|Finale: ''Mehr schnell''\n}}\nThe description below will use the tempo markings of the latter version.\n\n=== First movement ===\n\nThe symphony opens with tremolo strings and the lyrical main theme emerges from under this:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative c'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Moderato\" 2 = 60\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. \\p :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 2\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 3\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 4\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 5\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 6\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  }\n\\new Staff \\relative as' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n  R1*2 | % 3\n  as2. \\mf \\< ( g4 ) | % 4\n  fis2 \\! \\> ( g4 ) r4 \\! | % 5\n  as2 \\< ( ~ as8 g8 f8 es8 ) | % 6\n  f4 \\! \\> ( fis4 g4 ) r4 \\! }\n>> }\n</score>\nNote that although there is tremolo, it is a somewhat slower tremolo than what Bruckner would employ in later symphonies. Shortly after this, an \"enigmatic\" trumpet call appears:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative c'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60\n  c4. c8 \\times 2/3 {\n    c4. c8 c4\n  }\n  | % 2\n  c4. c8 \\times 2/3 {\n    c4. c8 c4\n  }\n  | % 3\n  g4 r4 r2\n  }\n>> }\n</score>\nThis rhythm is an important device and will recur throughout the movement.<ref name=\"Tintner\"/> The first theme group closes with one of the symphony's characteristic pauses and leads to the second theme group in E flat major:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n  \\new Staff <<\n    \\new Voice \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60 \\relative g' {\n  \\clef \"treble\" \\key es \\major \\stemUp \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\time 2/2 | % 1\n  g4 \\p ( bes,4 ) bes'4 ( bes,4 ) | % 2\n  as'4 -! bes,4 ( d4 bes'4 ) | % 3\n  g4 ( bes,4 ) bes'4 ( bes,4 ) | % 4\n  as'4 -! bes,4 ^( d4 bes'4 ) | % 5\n  g4 ^( bes,4 ) bes'4 ^( bes,4 ) | % 6\n  as'4 -! bes,4 ^( d4 bes'4 ) | % 7\n  bes4 r4 r2 }\n  \\relative bes {\n  \\clef \"treble\" \\key es \\major \\stemDown \\time 2/2 | % 1\n  s1*3 | % 4\n  r2 bes2 _~ | % 5\n  bes2 bes2 _~ | % 6\n  bes2 bes2 _~ | % 7\n  bes4 s4 s2 } >>\n  \\new Staff <<\n    \\new Voice \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\relative es, {\n  \\clef \"bass\" \\key es \\major \\stemDown \\time 2/2 \n  es4 r4 g4 r4 | % 2\n  f4 r4 bes,4 r4 | % 3\n  es4 r4 g4 \\mf r4 | % 4\n  f4 r4 bes,4 r4 | % 5\n  es4 r4 g4 r4 | % 6\n  f4 r4 bes,4 r4 | % 7\n  es4 r4 r2 }\n  \\relative bes {\n  \\clef \"bass\" \\key es \\major \\stemUp \\time 2/2\n  s2*4 | % 3\n  r2 bes2 ~ | % 4\n  bes2 c4 d4 | % 5\n  es1 ~ | % 6\n  es4 d4 c4 d4 | % 7\n  es2 s4 s4 } >>\n>> }\n</score>\nThe third theme group is also in E{{flat}} major:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative bes' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60\n  R1*2\\p | % 3\n  r4 <bes bes'>2 <bes bes'>4 ~ ~ | % 4\n  <bes bes'>4 <es es'>2 ( <d d'>4 ) | % 5\n  <g, g'>4 <c c'>2 ( <bes bes'>4 ) ~ ~ | % 6\n  <bes bes'>4 <es, es'>4 <bes' bes'>2\n  }\n\\new Staff \\relative es { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n  <es es'>4 \\p -! <bes bes'>8 ( <es\n  es'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <f' f'>8 | % 2\n  <g g'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <g' g'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <f'\n  f'>8 | % 3\n  <es es'>4 ) -! <bes bes'>8 ( <es es'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 (\n  <f' f'>8 | % 4\n  <g g'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <g' g'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <f'\n  f'>8 | % 5\n  <es es'>4 ) -! <bes bes'>8 ( <es es'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 (\n  <f' f'>8 | % 6\n  <g g'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <g' g'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! r4 \\! }\n>> }\n</score>\nThe trumpet call from the first group recurs here. The movement heads into its development after a brief [[codetta]]. The recapitulation opens just as the exposition did; with tremolo strings giving way to the main theme and the reappearance of the trumpet call. At the end, there is a brief recollection of the main theme before a grand peroration closes the movement. The first part of the coda is cut in the second version.\n\n=== Scherzo (Second in 1872, Third in 1877) ===\n\nIn the first version, both sections of the Scherzo and both sections of the Trio are repeated.

The development contains what William Carragan refers to as \"[[Fantasia (music)|fantasies]]\" on the first and second theme groups.<ref name =\"Carragan\"/> The recapitulation begins with the loud secondary theme of the first group before moving into the quieter first theme. Among other cuts between versions, one of note is in the coda of the movement. In the original version the coda is in two phases; a buildup leading to quotations of the first movement and the second theme group of this movement. This leads to the second phase, another buildup leading to the grand peroration in C major that closes the symphony. The first of these phases is cut in the second version, leaving only the final buildup and peroration.\n\n== Versions ==\nThe composer made two versions of this symphony recognised by the ''Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft'' (1872 and 1877). The work was also adjusted by the composer right before its premiere, as well as in 1876 and 1892.\n\n=== First version, 1872 ===\nThis was published in a 2005 edition by [[William Carragan]] under the auspices of the ''[[Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft]]'' in 2005.<ref name =\"Carragan\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.abruckner.com/Data/articles/articlesEnglish/carragantimed/symphonyno2/b2timinganalysis.pdf|title=William Carragan \u2013 Time analysis of versions 1872 and 1877}}</ref> The Scherzo comes second; the slow movement follows.

It was actually the fourth symphony composed by Bruckner, after the [[Study Symphony in F minor]] (1863), the [[Symphony No. 1 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 1 in C minor]] (1866), and the [[Symphony in D minor (Bruckner)|Symphony \"No. 0\" in D minor]] (1869).\n\n== History ==\nIn the fall of 1871, after having become established in Vienna, Anton Bruckner embarked on a new symphonic project, his fourth, which in less than a year would result in a completed and copied score of nearly 2000 [[Bar (music)|bars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carragan.com/composer-anton-bruckner/second-symphony-studies/anton-bruckners-symphony-no-2/|title=Anton Bruckner\u2019s Symphony No. 2|first=William|last=Carragan}}</ref>\nThe Symphony No. 2, which was mostly written in the summer of 1872, represents a breakthrough in Bruckner\u2019s conception of the symphony. Although Bruckner had been composing sonata-form movements with three distinct themes since he began writing symphonies in 1862, in 1872 he greatly expanded the scope of their presentation and development, and established the framework, which he would use consistently in all of his subsequent symphonic work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carragan.com/composer-anton-bruckner/second-symphony-studies/|title=Second Symphony Studies|first=William|last=Carragan}}</ref> Moreover, the Adagio of this symphony is in ABA\u2032B\u2032A\u2033 ''Lied'' form followed by a coda \u2013 the framework which Bruckner would use in his subsequent symphonic work, with exception of the [[Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)|Sixth]].<ref name=\"brand2\"/>\n\nThe Second Symphony is the only numbered Bruckner symphony without a dedication; [[Franz Liszt]] tacitly rejected the dedication, and [[Richard Wagner]] chose the [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3 in D minor]] when offered both works. The symphony was planned to be performed in the same year by the Vienna Philharmonic under [[Felix Otto Dessoff|Otto Dessoff]]. However, the rehearsal did not lead to a performance, because Dessoff and a number of players considered it impossible to perform. Nevertheless, the symphony was premiered the following year, on 26 October 1873, by the Vienna Philharmonic with Bruckner himself on the podium.\n\n== Description ==\nThe score calls for a pair each of [[flute]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[timpani]], and [[string instrument|strings]].\n\nThe symphony has four [[movement (music)|movements]]. In the first version (1872) they are:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman \n|Allegro: ''Ziemlich schnell'' (C minor)\n|Scherzo (C minor) \u2013 Trio (C major)\n|Adagio (A{{flat}} major)\n|Finale (C minor)\n}}\nIn the second version (1877) they are:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Moderato\n|Andante: ''Feierlich, etwas bewegt''\n|Scherzo: ''M\u00e4\u00dfig schnell'' \u2013 Trio: ''Gleiches tempo''\n|Finale: ''Mehr schnell''\n}}\nThe description below will use the tempo markings of the latter version.\n\n=== First movement ===\n\nThe symphony opens with tremolo strings and the lyrical main theme emerges from under this:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative c'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Moderato\" 2 = 60\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. \\p :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 2\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 3\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 4\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 5\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  | % 6\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  \\times 4/6  {\n    <c es c'>2. :8\n  }\n  }\n\\new Staff \\relative as' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n  R1*2 | % 3\n  as2. \\mf \\< ( g4 ) | % 4\n  fis2 \\! \\> ( g4 ) r4 \\! | % 5\n  as2 \\< ( ~ as8 g8 f8 es8 ) | % 6\n  f4 \\! \\> ( fis4 g4 ) r4 \\! }\n>> }\n</score>\nNote that although there is tremolo, it is a somewhat slower tremolo than what Bruckner would employ in later symphonies. Shortly after this, an \"enigmatic\" trumpet call appears:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative c'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60\n  c4. c8 \\times 2/3 {\n    c4. c8 c4\n  }\n  | % 2\n  c4. c8 \\times 2/3 {\n    c4. c8 c4\n  }\n  | % 3\n  g4 r4 r2\n  }\n>> }\n</score>\nThis rhythm is an important device and will recur throughout the movement.<ref name=\"Tintner\"/> The first theme group closes with one of the symphony's characteristic pauses and leads to the second theme group in E flat major:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n  \\new Staff <<\n    \\new Voice \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60 \\relative g' {\n  \\clef \"treble\" \\key es \\major \\stemUp \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\time 2/2 | % 1\n  g4 \\p ( bes,4 ) bes'4 ( bes,4 ) | % 2\n  as'4 -! bes,4 ( d4 bes'4 ) | % 3\n  g4 ( bes,4 ) bes'4 ( bes,4 ) | % 4\n  as'4 -! bes,4 ^( d4 bes'4 ) | % 5\n  g4 ^( bes,4 ) bes'4 ^( bes,4 ) | % 6\n  as'4 -! bes,4 ^( d4 bes'4 ) | % 7\n  bes4 r4 r2 }\n  \\relative bes {\n  \\clef \"treble\" \\key es \\major \\stemDown \\time 2/2 | % 1\n  s1*3 | % 4\n  r2 bes2 _~ | % 5\n  bes2 bes2 _~ | % 6\n  bes2 bes2 _~ | % 7\n  bes4 s4 s2 } >>\n  \\new Staff <<\n    \\new Voice \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\relative es, {\n  \\clef \"bass\" \\key es \\major \\stemDown \\time 2/2 \n  es4 r4 g4 r4 | % 2\n  f4 r4 bes,4 r4 | % 3\n  es4 r4 g4 \\mf r4 | % 4\n  f4 r4 bes,4 r4 | % 5\n  es4 r4 g4 r4 | % 6\n  f4 r4 bes,4 r4 | % 7\n  es4 r4 r2 }\n  \\relative bes {\n  \\clef \"bass\" \\key es \\major \\stemUp \\time 2/2\n  s2*4 | % 3\n  r2 bes2 ~ | % 4\n  bes2 c4 d4 | % 5\n  es1 ~ | % 6\n  es4 d4 c4 d4 | % 7\n  es2 s4 s4 } >>\n>> }\n</score>\nThe third theme group is also in E{{flat}} major:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\">\n{ \\new PianoStaff <<\n\\new Staff \\relative bes' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 60\n  R1*2\\p | % 3\n  r4 <bes bes'>2 <bes bes'>4 ~ ~ | % 4\n  <bes bes'>4 <es es'>2 ( <d d'>4 ) | % 5\n  <g, g'>4 <c c'>2 ( <bes bes'>4 ) ~ ~ | % 6\n  <bes bes'>4 <es, es'>4 <bes' bes'>2\n  }\n\\new Staff \\relative es { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n  <es es'>4 \\p -! <bes bes'>8 ( <es\n  es'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <f' f'>8 | % 2\n  <g g'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <g' g'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <f'\n  f'>8 | % 3\n  <es es'>4 ) -! <bes bes'>8 ( <es es'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 (\n  <f' f'>8 | % 4\n  <g g'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <g' g'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <f'\n  f'>8 | % 5\n  <es es'>4 ) -! <bes bes'>8 ( <es es'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 (\n  <f' f'>8 | % 6\n  <g g'>4 ) -! <bes, bes'>8 ( <g' g'>8 <f f'>4 ) -! r4 \\! }\n>> }\n</score>\nThe trumpet call from the first group recurs here. The movement heads into its development after a brief [[codetta]]. The recapitulation opens just as the exposition did; with tremolo strings giving way to the main theme and the reappearance of the trumpet call. At the end, there is a brief recollection of the main theme before a grand peroration closes the movement. The first part of the coda is cut in the second version.\n\n=== Scherzo (Second in 1872, Third in 1877) ===\n\nIn the first version, both sections of the Scherzo and both sections of the Trio are repeated.

The development contains what William Carragan refers to as \"[[Fantasia (music)|fantasies]]\" on the first and second theme groups.<ref name =\"Carragan\"/> The recapitulation begins with the loud secondary theme of the first group before moving into the quieter first theme. Among other cuts between versions, one of note is in the coda of the movement. In the original version the coda is in two phases; a buildup leading to quotations of the first movement and the second theme group of this movement. This leads to the second phase, another buildup leading to the grand peroration in C major that closes the symphony. The first of these phases is cut in the second version, leaving only the final buildup and peroration.\n\n== Versions ==\nThe composer made two versions of this symphony recognised by the ''Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft'' (1872 and 1877). The work was also adjusted by the composer right before its premiere, as well as in 1876 and 1892.\n\n=== First version, 1872 ===\nThis was published in a 2005 edition by [[William Carragan]] under the auspices of the ''[[Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft]]'' in 2005.<ref name =\"Carragan\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.abruckner.com/Data/articles/articlesEnglish/carragantimed/symphonyno2/b2timinganalysis.pdf|title=William Carragan \u2013 Time analysis of versions 1872 and 1877}}</ref> The Scherzo comes second; the slow movement follows.

During the rehearsal, violin soloist Heinz Haunold told: \"\u2026 the violin solo at that point of the movement effectively prevented the orchestra from rising to the great climax \u2026 but it also contained a fatal trap for the performers of the symphony.\"<ref name=\"Car\"/>\n<blockquote>The violin solo \u2026 in duple quarters and duple eighths, \u2026 together with the rhythmic complexities already caused by the shift from sextuplets to quintuplets in the first violins, \u2026 must have created an amazingly detailed sound \u2013 not to say an impenetrable musical fog.\"<ref name=\"Car\">{{Cite web|url=https://carragan.com/composer-anton-bruckner/second-symphony-studies/notes-editing-bruckners-second-symphony/|title=Some Notes on Editing Bruckner\u2019s Second Symphony|first=William|last=Carragan}}</ref></blockquote>\n:In the coda, the solo horn, which was considered unplayable by the horn-player, was replaced by the first clarinet and the viola section.\n*'''Scherzo''': The repeats were deleted.\n*'''Finale''': A \"very dissonant section of the development\",<ref name =\"Carragan\"/> which includes at one point a striking alternation of short viola notes with pizzicato chords in the rest of the strings, was removed.
