Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate, but they don't believe her and walk away disgusted.\n\nThat night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on [[Mulholland Drive]] by his 24-year-old sister Ellie, who has just returned from visiting her boyfriend, Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke. Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky Morton, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half.  When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar.\n\nThe next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood. But she dismisses it.\n\nAt a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Soon after this Jenny heads down to the parking garage where she is chased and killed by a werewolf. Zela's predictions for both Jenny and Becky have come to pass.\n\nJimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a [[werewolf]], sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy's concerns she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned.\n\nJimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling team]]. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is [[Closeted|repressing his own homosexuality]].\n\nEllie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela, who warns about the effect the coming full moon will have. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel.

Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy.\n\nEllie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf. He confirms it, but claims it wasn't he who attacked her and Jimmy. When a fourth werewolf attacks them, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The new werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a [[one-night stand]] with Jake. She now wants revenge by killing all of the other girls Jake dates. When Jake refuses to let Joanie hurt Ellie, she knocks him out, then turns into werewolf form and starts attacking. Ellie and Jimmy fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire, apparently killing her in werewolf form, but she rises again as her head and heart are still connected. A policeman shoots her in the head, finally killing her. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared.\n\nJimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jake arrives. He reveals that since Joanie\u2019s curse was caused by him, the only way to cure it is to kill the werewolf who started the curse-line and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her werewolf form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body [[Spontaneous combustion|bursts into flames]].\n\nBo, Brooke, and Zipper arrive at the house. Bo and Jimmy are now friends; Jimmy kisses Brooke and walks her home along with Bo. Ellie is stuck with the clean-up of the messy house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Ellie Myers\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jimmy Myers\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Joanie\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Bo\n* [[Kristina Anapau]] as Brooke\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Zela\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Becky Morton\n* [[M\u00fda]] as Jenny Tate\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Kyle\n* [[Eric Ladin]] as Louie\n* [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Nosebleed Co-Worker\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Police Officer\n* [[Derek Mears]] as Werewolf\n* [[Scott Baio]] as himself\n* [[Craig Kilborn]] as himself\n* [[Lance Bass]] as himself\n* [[Bowling for Soup]] as themselves\n* Solar as Zipper, Ellie and Jimmy's dog\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe original script was written in August 2000. Dimension co-founder [[Bob Weinstein]] announced in October 2002 that ''Cursed'' would \"reinvent the werewolf genre,\" and [[Wes Craven]] would direct, with the movie being released around August 2003.\n\nChristina Ricci, [[Skeet Ulrich]], and Jesse Eisenberg were cast as the three leads. The original plotline had three strangers brought together by a car accident in the Hollywood Hills and the subsequent attack of a werewolf. The three characters were named Ellie Hudson, Vince Winston, and Jimmy Myers. With a budget of $38 million, ''Cursed'' commenced shooting in March 2003 in Los Angeles. The set used for the high school is [[Torrance High School]], the same used for [[Sunnydale High]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and West Beverly High on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and its spin-off ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]''. Filming also occurred at [[Verdugo Hills High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/j4fun/location/films.html|title=VHHS On Location! Feature Films|website=Lausd.k12.ca.us|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> Special effects were shot in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nHowever, the film soon suffered numerous production and script issues and was postponed for over a year. While production was stalled, several cast members had to be replaced due to scheduling conflicts with other films. When the movie was rewritten and reshot, many cast members had been cut entirely, including [[Skeet Ulrich]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Omar Epps]], [[Illeana Douglas]], [[Heather Langenkamp]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Robert Forster]], and [[Corey Feldman]]. Some of them had even filmed scenes which were scrapped by director [[Wes Craven]]. In the film, Ellie works among the crew of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'', with Kilborn making a [[cameo appearance]] and [[Scott Baio]], as himself, being booked to appear on the show. But by the time the film was released in February 2005, Kilborn had left the show and had been replaced with [[Craig Ferguson]].\n\nOnly about 90% of the original version was filmed, leaving the original scripted version unfilmed. Although, while filming the original version, producer Bob Weinstein told Wes Craven he was happy with the film, he later changed his opinion and ordered for the movie to be reshot with a new plot. After massive reshoots which included filming a new ending, Weinstein told Craven he didn't like the new ending, leading to another ending where Jake attacks Ellie and Jimmy in their home, despite some incoherence with the rest of the film.<ref name=\"craveonline.com\"/>\n\nRick Baker did the werewolf effects for the original version of the film, but once Bob Weinstein and Miramax ordered reshoots, all the scenes with Baker's effects were deleted and replaced by KNB.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Dimension cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Wes Craven commented, \"The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions. Then at the very end, it was chopped up and the studio thought they could make more with a PG-13 movie, and trashed it ... I thought it was completely disrespectful, and it hurt them too, and it was like they shot themselves in the foot with a shotgun.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/>\n\nJenny's death scene in the elevator was originally much gorier, her dead body shown with her belly ripped apart, but not even the R-rated DVD version included this scene. A picture of her mutilated body was, however, shown in a ''Fangoria'' article published before the film's release covering the infamously troubled production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smg.photobucket.com/user/marcobeltrami/media/scream/cursedmya.jpg.html|title=Photo by marcobeltrami|website=Photobucket|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Wes Craven was quoted saying; \"... the ''Cursed'' experience was so screwed up. I mean, that went on for two-and-a-half years of my life for a film that wasn't anything close to what it should have been. And another film that I was about to shoot having the plug pulled \u2013 ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'' \u2013 so it was like, I did learn from the ''Cursed'' experience not to do something for money. They said, 'We know you want to do another film, we'll pay you double.' And we were 10 days from shooting, and I said fine. But I ended up working two-and-a-half years for double my fee, but I could have done two-and-a-half movies, and done movies that were out there making money. In general, I think it's not worth it and part of the reason my phone hasn't rung is that that story is pretty well known.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2014, costar [[Judy Greer]] spoke of the film in an interview: \"I don't know why that movie got so fucked up. I don't understand it. I thought the script was fine. Honest to god, I didn't get the big deal. I don't know who kept making them fuck with it.\nThen we shot the movie for, like, seven years. I think they said we had four movies worth of footage. It was so fun, but so weird. I don't get it.

Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate, but they don't believe her and walk away disgusted.\n\nThat night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on [[Mulholland Drive]] by his 24-year-old sister Ellie, who has just returned from visiting her boyfriend, Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke. Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky Morton, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half.  When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar.\n\nThe next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood. But she dismisses it.\n\nAt a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Soon after this Jenny heads down to the parking garage where she is chased and killed by a werewolf. Zela's predictions for both Jenny and Becky have come to pass.\n\nJimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a [[werewolf]], sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy's concerns she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned.\n\nJimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling team]]. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is [[Closeted|repressing his own homosexuality]].\n\nEllie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela, who warns about the effect the coming full moon will have. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel. Their dog, Zipper,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.miramax.com/watch?v=d2Z2JvYToLgd13EOTXqHPtOBwBwbJFXv |author= [[Miramax]] |date= 2005 |title= ''Cursed'' - Bad Dog |publisher= Miramax |quote= Jimmy's dog Zipper develops a condition no veteranarian can cure. |accessdate= December 14, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094727/http://www.miramax.com/watch?v=d2Z2JvYToLgd13EOTXqHPtOBwBwbJFXv |archive-date= December 22, 2015 |url-status= dead }}</ref> bites Jimmy, tastes his blood, becomes a lycanthropoid monster, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy.\n\nEllie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf. He confirms it, but claims it wasn't he who attacked her and Jimmy. When a fourth werewolf attacks them, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The new werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a [[one-night stand]] with Jake. She now wants revenge by killing all of the other girls Jake dates. When Jake refuses to let Joanie hurt Ellie, she knocks him out, then turns into werewolf form and starts attacking. Ellie and Jimmy fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire, apparently killing her in werewolf form, but she rises again as her head and heart are still connected. A policeman shoots her in the head, finally killing her. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared.\n\nJimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jake arrives. He reveals that since Joanie\u2019s curse was caused by him, the only way to cure it is to kill the werewolf who started the curse-line and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her werewolf form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server.

Dimension co-founder [[Bob Weinstein]] announced in October 2002 that ''Cursed'' would \"reinvent the werewolf genre,\" and [[Wes Craven]] would direct, with the movie being released around August 2003.\n\nChristina Ricci, [[Skeet Ulrich]], and Jesse Eisenberg were cast as the three leads. The original plotline had three strangers brought together by a car accident in the Hollywood Hills and the subsequent attack of a werewolf. The three characters were named Ellie Hudson, Vince Winston, and Jimmy Myers. With a budget of $38 million, ''Cursed'' commenced shooting in March 2003 in Los Angeles. The set used for the high school is [[Torrance High School]], the same used for [[Sunnydale High]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and West Beverly High on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and its spin-off ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]''. Filming also occurred at [[Verdugo Hills High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/j4fun/location/films.html|title=VHHS On Location! Feature Films|website=Lausd.k12.ca.us|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> Special effects were shot in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nHowever, the film soon suffered numerous production and script issues and was postponed for over a year. While production was stalled, several cast members had to be replaced due to scheduling conflicts with other films. When the movie was rewritten and reshot, many cast members had been cut entirely, including [[Skeet Ulrich]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Omar Epps]], [[Illeana Douglas]], [[Heather Langenkamp]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Robert Forster]], and [[Corey Feldman]]. Some of them had even filmed scenes which were scrapped by director [[Wes Craven]]. In the film, Ellie works among the crew of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'', with Kilborn making a [[cameo appearance]] and [[Scott Baio]], as himself, being booked to appear on the show. But by the time the film was released in February 2005, Kilborn had left the show and had been replaced with [[Craig Ferguson]].\n\nOnly about 90% of the original version was filmed, leaving the original scripted version unfilmed. Although, while filming the original version, producer Bob Weinstein told Wes Craven he was happy with the film, he later changed his opinion and ordered for the movie to be reshot with a new plot. After massive reshoots which included filming a new ending, Weinstein told Craven he didn't like the new ending, leading to another ending where Jake attacks Ellie and Jimmy in their home, despite some incoherence with the rest of the film.<ref name=\"craveonline.com\"/>\n\nRick Baker did the werewolf effects for the original version of the film, but once Bob Weinstein and Miramax ordered reshoots, all the scenes with Baker's effects were deleted and replaced by KNB.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Dimension cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Wes Craven commented, \"The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions. Then at the very end, it was chopped up and the studio thought they could make more with a PG-13 movie, and trashed it ... I thought it was completely disrespectful, and it hurt them too, and it was like they shot themselves in the foot with a shotgun.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/>\n\nJenny's death scene in the elevator was originally much gorier, her dead body shown with her belly ripped apart, but not even the R-rated DVD version included this scene. A picture of her mutilated body was, however, shown in a ''Fangoria'' article published before the film's release covering the infamously troubled production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smg.photobucket.com/user/marcobeltrami/media/scream/cursedmya.jpg.html|title=Photo by marcobeltrami|website=Photobucket|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Wes Craven was quoted saying; \"... the ''Cursed'' experience was so screwed up. I mean, that went on for two-and-a-half years of my life for a film that wasn't anything close to what it should have been. And another film that I was about to shoot having the plug pulled \u2013 ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'' \u2013 so it was like, I did learn from the ''Cursed'' experience not to do something for money. They said, 'We know you want to do another film, we'll pay you double.' And we were 10 days from shooting, and I said fine. But I ended up working two-and-a-half years for double my fee, but I could have done two-and-a-half movies, and done movies that were out there making money. In general, I think it's not worth it and part of the reason my phone hasn't rung is that that story is pretty well known.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2014, costar [[Judy Greer]] spoke of the film in an interview: \"I don't know why that movie got so fucked up. I don't understand it. I thought the script was fine. Honest to god, I didn't get the big deal. I don't know who kept making them fuck with it.\nThen we shot the movie for, like, seven years. I think they said we had four movies worth of footage. It was so fun, but so weird. I don't get it.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited. Brad added some extra melodies but in the end Jackson decided not to use them.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]].

Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name=\"m1213\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name=\"palgn\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | alt1 =\n | alt2 =\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = Sonic 3 Special Stage.png\n | width1 = 240\n | caption1 = Tails in one of the special stages, in which the player can earn [[Chaos Emeralds]]\n | image2 = S3 special stage mechanics.svg\n | width2 = 240\n | caption2 = A diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres\n}}\n\n''Sonic 3'' contains two types of \"special stages\".

Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed.

Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name=\"palgn\" /><ref name=\"super\">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|publisher=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref> Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a [[post-credits scene]] in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|platform=Genesis/Mega Drive|scene=Ending sequence|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]], race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game.

It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. Players can control Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like helicopter rotor;<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> when he tires, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.<ref name=\"m89\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|zones]],<ref name=\"m1617\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> each divided into two acts. Levels are populated with Robotnik's robots, called \"badniks\"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the \"spin dash\" attack, which also gives the character a speed boost.<ref name=\"m89\" /> The levels include obstacles and other features such as [[vertical loop]]s, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits.<ref name=\"game\">{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=February 2, 1994}}</ref> There is a [[miniboss]] fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the second.<ref name=\"m45\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Reaching a new level [[Autosave|saves]] the game to one of six save slots.<ref name=\"m10\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAs with previous ''Sonic'' games, ''Sonic 3'' uses [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], scattered throughout the levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]]. Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name=\"m1213\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name=\"palgn\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | alt1 =\n | alt2 =\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = Sonic 3 Special Stage.png\n | width1 = 240\n | caption1 = Tails in one of the special stages, in which the player can earn [[Chaos Emeralds]]\n | image2 = S3 special stage mechanics.svg\n | width2 = 240\n | caption2 = A diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres\n}}\n\n''Sonic 3'' contains two types of \"special stages\".

Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor's floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.<ref name=\"m1415\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nThe second type, triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name=\"palgn\" /><ref name=\"super\">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|publisher=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref> Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a [[post-credits scene]] in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|platform=Genesis/Mega Drive|scene=Ending sequence|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]], race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game.

Genesis version of ''Sonic 3'' is one of the [[List of bestselling Sega Genesis video games|bestselling Genesis games]],<ref name=\"magicboxus\">{{cite

Box}}</ref>\n\nLike its predecessors, ''Sonic 3'' received critical acclaim. It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.
