The design was initially conceived by Bevin McKinney, who shared it with [[Gary Hudson (engineer)|Gary Hudson]]. In 1996, Rotary Rocket Company was formed to commercialize the concept. The Roton was intended to reduce costs of launching payloads into low earth orbit by a factor of ten.\n\nThe company gathered considerable [[venture capital]] from [[angel investor]]s and opened a factory headquartered in a {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]] in [[Mojave, California]]. The fuselage for their vehicles was made by [[Scaled Composites]], at the same airport, while the company developed the novel engine design and helicopter-like landing system. A full-scale test vehicle made three hover flights in 1999, but the company exhausted its funds and closed its doors in early 2001.\n\n== The venture's origins ==\n\n[[Bevin McKinney]] had been thinking about the idea of a launch vehicle using helicopter blades for several years, when [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] magazine asked [[Gary Hudson (engineer)|Gary Hudson]] to write an article on the concept.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.05/roton.html Wired - Insanely Great? or Just Plain Insane?]</ref> The resulting article resulted in a commitment of funding from billionaire [[Walter Anderson (entrepreneur)|Walt Anderson]], which was combined with an initial investment from author [[Tom Clancy]] and allowed the company to get started. [[Gary Hudson (engineer)|Hudson]] and [[McKinney]] were joined by co-founders [[Frederick Giarrusso]], [[Dan DeLong]], [[James Grote]], [[Tom Brosz]], and Anne Hudson, who together launched the company in October 1996.\n\n== Rotary Rocket design evolution ==\n\n=== Helicopter to orbit ===\n\nGary Hudson's and [[Bevin McKinney]]'s initial concept was to merge a launch vehicle with a helicopter: spinning [[Helicopter rotor|rotor blades]], powered by [[tip jet]]s, would lift the vehicle in the earliest stage of launch. Once the air density thinned to the point that helicopter flight was impractical, the vehicle would continue its ascent on pure rocket power, with the rotor acting as a giant [[turbopump]].<ref>[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.05/roton.html Wired - Insanely Great? or Just Plain Insane?]</ref>\n\nCalculations showed that the helicopter blades modestly increased the effective [[specific impulse]] (''I''<sub>sp</sub>) by approximately 20\u201330 seconds, essentially only carrying the blades into orbit \"for free\". Thus, there was no overall gain from this method during ascent. However, the blades could be used to soft land the vehicle, so its landing system carried no additional cost.\n\nOne problem found during research at Rotary was that once the vehicle left the atmosphere additional thrust would be necessary. Thus multiple engines would be needed at the base as well as at the rotor tips.\n\nThis initial version of the Roton had been designed with the small communications satellite market in mind. However, this market crashed, signaled by the failure of [[Iridium Communications]]. Consequently, the Roton concept needed to be redesigned for heavier payloads.\n\n=== Helicopter from orbit ===\n\nThe revised and redesigned '''Roton''' concept was a cone-shaped launch vehicle, with a helicopter rotor on top for use only during landing. An internal cargo bay could be used both for carrying payloads to orbit and bringing others back to Earth. The projected price to orbit of this design was given as $1,000 per kg of payload, less than one-tenth of the then-current launch price. Payload capacity was limited to a relatively modest {{convert|6000|lb|kg}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe revised version would have used a unique rotating annular [[aerospike engine]]: the engine and base of the launch vehicle would spin at high speed (720 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) to pump fuel and oxidizer to the rim by the rotation. Unlike the landing rotor, due to the shallow angle of the nozzles in the base rotor, the rotation speed self limited and required no control system. Since the density of the LOX ([[liquid oxygen]]) was higher than that of the kerosene, extra pressure was available with the LOX, so it would have been used to cool the engine's throat and other components, rather than using the kerosene as the coolant as in a [[RP-1#Usage_and_history|conventional LOX/kerosene rocket.]] However, at the high G levels at the outer edge of the rotating engine block, clarity on how LOX would work as a coolant was both unknown and difficult to validate. That added one layer of risk.\n\nIn addition, the rotating exhaust acted as a wall at the outer edge of the engine base, lowering the temperature of the base to below ambient due to ejector pump effect and creating a suction cup at the bottom in atmosphere. This could be alleviated using makeup gas to develop base pressure, requiring an additional rocket engine to fill up the base of the main rocket engine. (Similar problems would have occurred in a [[Aerospike_engine#Principles|conventional aerospike engine]], but there, natural recirculation plus use of the [[Gas-generator_cycle|turbopump gas-generator's exhaust]] as the makeup gas would have largely alleviated the problem \"for free.\")\n\nAt the rim, 96 miniature jets would exhaust the burning propellants (LOX and [[kerosene]]) around the rim of the base of the vehicle, which gained the vehicle extra thrust at high altitude \u2013 acting as a zero-length truncated aerospike nozzle.<ref>United States Patent 5842665</ref> A similar system with non-rotating engines was studied for the [[N1 rocket]]. That application had a much smaller base area, and did not create the suction effect a larger peripheral engine induces. The Roton engine had a projected vacuum [[Specific impulse|I<sub>SP</sub> (specific impulse)]] of ~{{convert|355|isp}}, which is very high for a LOX/kerosene engine \u2013and a thrust to weight ratio of 150, which is extremely light.<ref>Anselmo, Joseph C., \"Rotarians.\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', October 5, 1998, p. 17.</ref>\n\nDuring reentry, the base also served as a water-cooled [[heatshield]]. This was theoretically a good way to survive reentry, particularly for a lightweight reusable vehicle. However, using water as a coolant would require converting it into superheated steam, at high temperatures and pressures, and there were concerns about micrometeorite damage on orbit puncturing the pressure vessel, causing the reentry shield to fail. These concerns were resolved using a failure-resistant massively redundant flow system, created using thin metal sheets chemically etched with a pattern of micropores forming a channel system that was robust against failure and damage.\n\nIn addition, cooling was achieved two different ways; one way was the vaporization of the water, but the second was even more significant, and was due to the creation of a layer of \"cool\" steam surrounding the base surface, reducing the ability to heat. Further, the water metering system would have to be extremely reliable, giving one drop per second per square inch, and was achieved via a trial/error design approach on real hardware. By the end of the Roton program, some hardware had been built and tested. The reentry trajectory was to be trimmed, similar to the Soyuz, to minimize the G loads on the passengers. And the ballistic coefficient was better for the Roton and could be better tailored. When the Soyuz trim system failed and it went full ballistic, the G levels did rise significantly but without incident to the passengers.\n\nThe vehicle was also unique in planning to use its [[helicopter]]-style [[helicopter rotor|rotor]]s for landing, rather than wings or parachutes. This concept allowed controlled landings (unlike parachutes), and it was 1/5 the weight of fixed wings. Another advantage was that a helicopter could land almost anywhere, whereas winged [[spaceplane]]s such as the Space Shuttle had to make it back to the runway.\nThe rotor blades were to be powered by peroxide tip rockets. The rotor blades were to be deployed before reentry; some questions were raised about whether the blades would survive until landing.\n\nThe initial plan was to have them almost vertical, but that was found to be unstable as they needed to drop lower and lower and spin faster for stability, the heating rates went up dramatically and the air flow became more head on. The implication of that was that the blades went from a lightly heated piece of hardware to one that either had to be actively cooled or made of SiC or other refractory material. The idea of popping out the blades became much more attractive at this point, and initial studies were made for that option. This rotor design concept was not without precedent. In 1955, one of five [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs for planned suborbital piloted missions was to include rocket-tipped rotors as its landing system. On May 1, 1958 these plans were dropped as a decision was made to proceed directly to orbital flights.\n\nRotary Rocket designed and pressure-tested an exceptionally lightweight but strong [[composite material|composite]] LOX tank. It survived a test program which involved it being pressure cycled and ultimately deliberately shot to test its ignition sensitivity.\n\n=== A new engine ===\n\nIn June 1999, Rotary Rocket announced that it would use a derivative of the [[Fastrac (engine)|Fastrac]] engine under development at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], instead of the company's own unconventional spinning engine design. Reportedly, the company had been unable to convince investors that its engine design was viable; the composite structure and gyrocopter reentry was an easier sell.\n\nAt the same time as this change, the company laid off about a third of its employees, lowering approximate headcount from 60 to 40. At this point, the company planned to begin its commercial launch service sometime in 2001.<ref>Dornheim, Michael A., \"Rotary Cuts Staff, Changes Engine.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', June 28, 1999, p. 44.</ref> Although the company had raised $30 million, it still needed to raise an additional $120 million before entering service.\n\n== The Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) ==\n[[File:Roton-bat-cave.jpg|right|thumb|The ATV's cockpit was nicknamed the 'Batcave' by its pilots because of its restricted field of view.]]\n\nA full size, 63&nbsp;ft (19 m) tall, Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) was built under contract by [[Scaled Composites]] for use in hover test flights. The $2.8 million ATV was not intended as an all-up test article, since it had no rocket engine and no heat shielding. The ATV was rolled out of its Mojave hangar on March 1, 1999, bearing an FAA registry of N990RR.\n\nThe rotor head was salvaged from a crashed [[Sikorsky S-58]], at a price of $50,000 \u2013as opposed to as much as $1 million for a new head. Each rotor was powered by a 350-lbf (1,560 N) [[high-test peroxide|hydrogen peroxide]] jet, as intended for the orbital vehicle.<ref>Dornheim, Michael A., \"Roton Test Craft Rolled Out.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', March 8, 1999, p. 40.</ref> The rotor assemblage was tested in a rock quarry before installation on the ATV.\n\nThe ATV flew three successful test flights in 1999. The pilot for these three flights was [[Marti Sarigul-Klijn]] and the copilot was [[Brian Binnie]] (who later gained fame as pilot of Scaled Composites' [[SpaceShipOne]] on its second [[Ansari X Prize|X-Prize]] flight).\n\nThe ATV made its first flight on July 28. This flight consisted of three vertical hops totaling 4 min 40 sec in duration and reaching a maximum altitude of 8&nbsp;ft (2.4 m). The pilots found the flying extremely challenging for a number of reasons. Visibility in the cockpit was so restricted that the pilots nicknamed it the [[Batcave]]. The view of the ground was entirely obstructed, so the pilots had to rely on a sonar altimeter to judge ground proximity. The entire craft had a low rotational inertia, and torque from the spinning rotor blades made the body spin, unless counteracted by yaw thrust in the opposite direction.<ref>Dornheim, Michael A., \"Roton Hops Off Ground.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', August 12, 1999, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe second flight, on September 16, was a continuous hover flight lasting 2 min 30 sec, reaching a maximum altitude of 20&nbsp;ft (6.1 m). The sustained flight was made possible by the installation of more powerful rotor tip thrusters and an [[autothrottle]].<ref>Smith, Bruce A., \"Roton Test.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', October 11, 1999, p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe third and last flight was made on October 12. The ATV flew down the flightline at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]], covering 4,300&nbsp;ft (1,310 m) in its flight and rising to a maximum altitude of 75&nbsp;ft (23 m). The speed was as high as 53&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). This test revealed some instability in translational flight.\n\nA fourth test was planned to simulate a full autorotative descent. The ATV would climb to an altitude 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,050 m) under its own power, before throttling back and returning for a soft landing.<ref>\"Roton Achieves Forward Flight.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', October 25, 1999, p. 40.</ref> At this point, given that further funding was then unlikely, safety considerations prevented the test being attempted.\n\n== Criticism of the design ==\n\nRotary Rocket failed due to lack of funding, but some{{who|date=February 2013}} have suggested that the design itself was inherently flawed.\n\nThe Rotary Rocket did fly three test flights and a composite propellant tank survived a full test program, however these tests revealed problems. For instance, the ATV demonstrated that landing the Rotary Rocket was tricky, even dangerous. Test pilots have a rating system, the [[Cooper-Harper rating scale]], for vehicles between 1 and 10 that relates to difficulty to pilot. The Roton ATV scored a 10 \u2014 the vehicle simulator was found to be almost unflyable by anyone except the Rotary test pilots, and even then there were short periods where the vehicle was out of control.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nOther aspects of the flight plan remained unproven and it is unknown whether Roton could have developed sufficient performance to reach orbit with a single stage, and return \u2013 although on paper this might have been possible.\n\n== The venture's last days ==\n[[File:Rotary-rocket-hangars.jpg|right|thumb|The Rotary Rocket Hangars at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]], as seen in 2005. The taller hangar on the left was the Rotary Rocket Assembly Building.]]\n\nEngine development ceased in 2000, reportedly two weeks before a full-scale test was due. The vehicle failed to secure launch contracts and Rotary Rocket closed its doors in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe timing of the venture was unfortunate: the [[Iridium Communications]] venture was nearing bankruptcy, and the [[space industry]] in general was experiencing financial stress. Ultimately, the company did not attract sufficient funding \u2013 even though numerous individuals provided a total of $33 million of support, including writer [[Tom Clancy]].<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rotary-rocket-unveils-new-rlv-design-major-investor-tom-clancy-becomes-a-director-74742647.html Rotary Rocket Unveils New RLV Design Major Investor Tom Clancy Becomes a Director]</ref>\n\nSome of the engineers that worked there have since set up other rocketry ventures, notably [[XCOR Aerospace]], [[t/Space]] and Space Launch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe Atmospheric Test Vehicle was to be displayed at [[Classic Rotors Museum]], a helicopter museum near [[San Diego, California]], but an attempt to move it there on May 9, 2003 via a short-line sling-load under an Army Reserve [[CH-47 Chinook]] failed when the Roton began to oscillate at airspeeds above {{convert|35|kn|km/h}}. Instead, the Mojave Airport administration worked to keep this historic vehicle at Mojave, and on November 10, 2006, the Roton was moved to its permanent display location at the intersection of Airport Blvd and Sabovich Road. To many, the Roton represents the program that launched Mojave into the Space Age, and this theme was echoed during the dedication ceremony that took place during the Veterans' Day celebration on November 11, at which [[Brian Binnie]] was the keynote speaker.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe Rotary Rocket hangars are now occupied by the [[National Test Pilot School]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n=== Roton C-9 specifications ===\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=<ref>[http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/rlvs/rotary_specs.shtml Rotary Rocket - Specifications<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908125423/http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/rlvs/rotary_specs.shtml|date=2006-09-08 }}</ref><ref>http://astronautix.com/r/roton.html</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|capacity={{cvt|7000|lb}} of payload\n|length ft=64\n|dia ft=22\n|gross weight lb=400000\n|fuel capacity={{cvt|372,500|lb}}\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=72\n|eng1 name=Rotary RocketJet\n|eng1 type=[[rocket engine]]s\n|eng1 lbf=6,950\n|eng1 note=in vacuum\n|more power=\n* '''Specific impulse:''' {{cvt|340|isp}}\n* '''Burn time:''' 253 s\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|range nmi=100\n}}\n\n== See also==\n* [[Hiller YH-32 Hornet|Hiller Hornet]], a helicopter with ramjets mounted on the rotor blade tips.\n== References ==\n\n; Citations\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n\n; Bibliography\n\n* Petit, Charles, \"Rockets for the Rest of Us.\" ''Air&Space/Smithsonian Magazine'', March, 1998.

Thus multiple engines would be needed at the base as well as at the rotor tips.\n\nThis initial version of the Roton had been designed with the small communications satellite market in mind. However, this market crashed, signaled by the failure of [[Iridium Communications]]. Consequently, the Roton concept needed to be redesigned for heavier payloads.\n\n=== Helicopter from orbit ===\n\nThe revised and redesigned '''Roton''' concept was a cone-shaped launch vehicle, with a helicopter rotor on top for use only during landing. An internal cargo bay could be used both for carrying payloads to orbit and bringing others back to Earth. The projected price to orbit of this design was given as $1,000 per kg of payload, less than one-tenth of the then-current launch price. Payload capacity was limited to a relatively modest {{convert|6000|lb|kg}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe revised version would have used a unique rotating annular [[aerospike engine]]: the engine and base of the launch vehicle would spin at high speed (720 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) to pump fuel and oxidizer to the rim by the rotation. Unlike the landing rotor, due to the shallow angle of the nozzles in the base rotor, the rotation speed self limited and required no control system. Since the density of the LOX ([[liquid oxygen]]) was higher than that of the kerosene, extra pressure was available with the LOX, so it would have been used to cool the engine's throat and other components, rather than using the kerosene as the coolant as in a [[RP-1#Usage_and_history|conventional LOX/kerosene rocket.]] However, at the high G levels at the outer edge of the rotating engine block, clarity on how LOX would work as a coolant was both unknown and difficult to validate. That added one layer of risk.\n\nIn addition, the rotating exhaust acted as a wall at the outer edge of the engine base, lowering the temperature of the base to below ambient due to ejector pump effect and creating a suction cup at the bottom in atmosphere. This could be alleviated using makeup gas to develop base pressure, requiring an additional rocket engine to fill up the base of the main rocket engine. (Similar problems would have occurred in a [[Aerospike_engine#Principles|conventional aerospike engine]], but there, natural recirculation plus use of the [[Gas-generator_cycle|turbopump gas-generator's exhaust]] as the makeup gas would have largely alleviated the problem \"for free.\")\n\nAt the rim, 96 miniature jets would exhaust the burning propellants (LOX and [[kerosene]]) around the rim of the base of the vehicle, which gained the vehicle extra thrust at high altitude \u2013 acting as a zero-length truncated aerospike nozzle.<ref>United States Patent 5842665</ref> A similar system with non-rotating engines was studied for the [[N1 rocket]]. That application had a much smaller base area, and did not create the suction effect a larger peripheral engine induces. The Roton engine had a projected vacuum [[Specific impulse|I<sub>SP</sub> (specific impulse)]] of ~{{convert|355|isp}}, which is very high for a LOX/kerosene engine \u2013and a thrust to weight ratio of 150, which is extremely light.<ref>Anselmo, Joseph C., \"Rotarians.\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', October 5, 1998, p. 17.</ref>\n\nDuring reentry, the base also served as a water-cooled [[heatshield]]. This was theoretically a good way to survive reentry, particularly for a lightweight reusable vehicle. However, using water as a coolant would require converting it into superheated steam, at high temperatures and pressures, and there were concerns about micrometeorite damage on orbit puncturing the pressure vessel, causing the reentry shield to fail. These concerns were resolved using a failure-resistant massively redundant flow system, created using thin metal sheets chemically etched with a pattern of micropores forming a channel system that was robust against failure and damage.\n\nIn addition, cooling was achieved two different ways; one way was the vaporization of the water, but the second was even more significant, and was due to the creation of a layer of \"cool\" steam surrounding the base surface, reducing the ability to heat. Further, the water metering system would have to be extremely reliable, giving one drop per second per square inch, and was achieved via a trial/error design approach on real hardware. By the end of the Roton program, some hardware had been built and tested. The reentry trajectory was to be trimmed, similar to the Soyuz, to minimize the G loads on the passengers. And the ballistic coefficient was better for the Roton and could be better tailored. When the Soyuz trim system failed and it went full ballistic, the G levels did rise significantly but without incident to the passengers.\n\nThe vehicle was also unique in planning to use its [[helicopter]]-style [[helicopter rotor|rotor]]s for landing, rather than wings or parachutes. This concept allowed controlled landings (unlike parachutes), and it was 1/5 the weight of fixed wings. Another advantage was that a helicopter could land almost anywhere, whereas winged [[spaceplane]]s such as the Space Shuttle had to make it back to the runway.\nThe rotor blades were to be powered by peroxide tip rockets. The rotor blades were to be deployed before reentry; some questions were raised about whether the blades would survive until landing.\n\nThe initial plan was to have them almost vertical, but that was found to be unstable as they needed to drop lower and lower and spin faster for stability, the heating rates went up dramatically and the air flow became more head on. The implication of that was that the blades went from a lightly heated piece of hardware to one that either had to be actively cooled or made of SiC or other refractory material. The idea of popping out the blades became much more attractive at this point, and initial studies were made for that option. This rotor design concept was not without precedent. In 1955, one of five [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs for planned suborbital piloted missions was to include rocket-tipped rotors as its landing system. On May 1, 1958 these plans were dropped as a decision was made to proceed directly to orbital flights.\n\nRotary Rocket designed and pressure-tested an exceptionally lightweight but strong [[composite material|composite]] LOX tank. It survived a test program which involved it being pressure cycled and ultimately deliberately shot to test its ignition sensitivity.\n\n=== A new engine ===\n\nIn June 1999, Rotary Rocket announced that it would use a derivative of the [[Fastrac (engine)|Fastrac]] engine under development at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], instead of the company's own unconventional spinning engine design. Reportedly, the company had been unable to convince investors that its engine design was viable; the composite structure and gyrocopter reentry was an easier sell.\n\nAt the same time as this change, the company laid off about a third of its employees, lowering approximate headcount from 60 to 40. At this point, the company planned to begin its commercial launch service sometime in 2001.<ref>Dornheim, Michael A., \"Rotary Cuts Staff, Changes Engine.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', June 28, 1999, p. 44.</ref> Although the company had raised $30 million, it still needed to raise an additional $120 million before entering service.\n\n== The Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) ==\n[[File:Roton-bat-cave.jpg|right|thumb|The ATV's cockpit was nicknamed the 'Batcave' by its pilots because of its restricted field of view.]]\n\nA full size, 63&nbsp;ft (19 m) tall, Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) was built under contract by [[Scaled Composites]] for use in hover test flights. The $2.8 million ATV was not intended as an all-up test article, since it had no rocket engine and no heat shielding. The ATV was rolled out of its Mojave hangar on March 1, 1999, bearing an FAA registry of N990RR.\n\nThe rotor head was salvaged from a crashed [[Sikorsky S-58]], at a price of $50,000 \u2013as opposed to as much as $1 million for a new head. Each rotor was powered by a 350-lbf (1,560 N) [[high-test peroxide|hydrogen peroxide]] jet, as intended for the orbital vehicle.<ref>Dornheim, Michael A., \"Roton Test Craft Rolled Out.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', March 8, 1999, p. 40.</ref> The rotor assemblage was tested in a rock quarry before installation on the ATV.\n\nThe ATV flew three successful test flights in 1999. The pilot for these three flights was [[Marti Sarigul-Klijn]] and the copilot was [[Brian Binnie]] (who later gained fame as pilot of Scaled Composites' [[SpaceShipOne]] on its second [[Ansari X Prize|X-Prize]] flight).\n\nThe ATV made its first flight on July 28. This flight consisted of three vertical hops totaling 4 min 40 sec in duration and reaching a maximum altitude of 8&nbsp;ft (2.4 m). The pilots found the flying extremely challenging for a number of reasons. Visibility in the cockpit was so restricted that the pilots nicknamed it the [[Batcave]]. The view of the ground was entirely obstructed, so the pilots had to rely on a sonar altimeter to judge ground proximity. The entire craft had a low rotational inertia, and torque from the spinning rotor blades made the body spin, unless counteracted by yaw thrust in the opposite direction.<ref>Dornheim, Michael A., \"Roton Hops Off Ground.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', August 12, 1999, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe second flight, on September 16, was a continuous hover flight lasting 2 min 30 sec, reaching a maximum altitude of 20&nbsp;ft (6.1 m). The sustained flight was made possible by the installation of more powerful rotor tip thrusters and an [[autothrottle]].<ref>Smith, Bruce A., \"Roton Test.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', October 11, 1999, p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe third and last flight was made on October 12. The ATV flew down the flightline at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]], covering 4,300&nbsp;ft (1,310 m) in its flight and rising to a maximum altitude of 75&nbsp;ft (23 m). The speed was as high as 53&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). This test revealed some instability in translational flight.\n\nA fourth test was planned to simulate a full autorotative descent. The ATV would climb to an altitude 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,050 m) under its own power, before throttling back and returning for a soft landing.<ref>\"Roton Achieves Forward Flight.\" ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', October 25, 1999, p. 40.</ref> At this point, given that further funding was then unlikely, safety considerations prevented the test being attempted.\n\n== Criticism of the design ==\n\nRotary Rocket failed due to lack of funding, but some{{who|date=February 2013}} have suggested that the design itself was inherently flawed.\n\nThe Rotary Rocket did fly three test flights and a composite propellant tank survived a full test program, however these tests revealed problems. For instance, the ATV demonstrated that landing the Rotary Rocket was tricky, even dangerous. Test pilots have a rating system, the [[Cooper-Harper rating scale]], for vehicles between 1 and 10 that relates to difficulty to pilot. The Roton ATV scored a 10 \u2014 the vehicle simulator was found to be almost unflyable by anyone except the Rotary test pilots, and even then there were short periods where the vehicle was out of control.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nOther aspects of the flight plan remained unproven and it is unknown whether Roton could have developed sufficient performance to reach orbit with a single stage, and return \u2013 although on paper this might have been possible.\n\n== The venture's last days ==\n[[File:Rotary-rocket-hangars.jpg|right|thumb|The Rotary Rocket Hangars at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]], as seen in 2005. The taller hangar on the left was the Rotary Rocket Assembly Building.]]\n\nEngine development ceased in 2000, reportedly two weeks before a full-scale test was due. The vehicle failed to secure launch contracts and Rotary Rocket closed its doors in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe timing of the venture was unfortunate: the [[Iridium Communications]] venture was nearing bankruptcy, and the [[space industry]] in general was experiencing financial stress. Ultimately, the company did not attract sufficient funding \u2013 even though numerous individuals provided a total of $33 million of support, including writer [[Tom Clancy]].<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rotary-rocket-unveils-new-rlv-design-major-investor-tom-clancy-becomes-a-director-74742647.html Rotary Rocket Unveils New RLV Design Major Investor Tom Clancy Becomes a Director]</ref>\n\nSome of the engineers that worked there have since set up other rocketry ventures, notably [[XCOR Aerospace]], [[t/Space]] and Space Launch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe Atmospheric Test Vehicle was to be displayed at [[Classic Rotors Museum]], a helicopter museum near [[San Diego, California]], but an attempt to move it there on May 9, 2003 via a short-line sling-load under an Army Reserve [[CH-47 Chinook]] failed when the Roton began to oscillate at airspeeds above {{convert|35|kn|km/h}}. Instead, the Mojave Airport administration worked to keep this historic vehicle at Mojave, and on November 10, 2006, the Roton was moved to its permanent display location at the intersection of Airport Blvd and Sabovich Road. To many, the Roton represents the program that launched Mojave into the Space Age, and this theme was echoed during the dedication ceremony that took place during the Veterans' Day celebration on November 11, at which [[Brian Binnie]] was the keynote speaker.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe Rotary Rocket hangars are now occupied by the [[National Test Pilot School]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n=== Roton C-9 specifications ===\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=<ref>[http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/rlvs/rotary_specs.shtml Rotary Rocket - Specifications<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908125423/http://www.spaceandtech.com/spacedata/rlvs/rotary_specs.shtml|date=2006-09-08 }}</ref><ref>http://astronautix.com/r/roton.html</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|capacity={{cvt|7000|lb}} of payload\n|length ft=64\n|dia ft=22\n|gross weight lb=400000\n|fuel capacity={{cvt|372,500|lb}}\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=72\n|eng1 name=Rotary RocketJet\n|eng1 type=[[rocket engine]]s\n|eng1 lbf=6,950\n|eng1 note=in vacuum\n|more power=\n* '''Specific impulse:''' {{cvt|340|isp}}\n* '''Burn time:''' 253 s\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|range nmi=100\n}}\n\n== See also==\n* [[Hiller YH-32 Hornet|Hiller Hornet]], a helicopter with ramjets mounted on the rotor blade tips.\n== References ==\n\n; Citations\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n\n; Bibliography\n\n* Petit, Charles, \"Rockets for the Rest of Us.\" ''Air&Space/Smithsonian Magazine'', March, 1998.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner.

A clear sign of his precarious position was his inability to prevent the arrest for \"[[treason]]\", in December 1948, of his Jewish wife, [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]], whom Stalin had long distrusted.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=199\u2013201}} Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening to remind him that, in his own words, \"she suffered because of me\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=604}}\n\nPolina Zhemchuzhina befriended [[Golda Meir]], who arrived in Moscow in November 1948 as the first Israeli envoy to the USSR.<ref>[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]] (1987), ''A History of the Jews'', p. 527</ref> According to a close collaborator of Molotov, [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev]],<ref>V.

Immediately afterwards, Polina was arrested and accused of ties with [[Zionist]] organisations. She was imprisoned for a year in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]], after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed. Polina was freed immediately after the death of Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}} According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: \"She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in the Soviet Union; she's also a real [[Bolshevik]], a real Soviet person.\" \n[[File:Polina Zhemchuzhina.jpg|thumb|Molotov with his wife [[Polina Zhemchuzhina|Polina]]]]\nHowever Polina's feelings were not reciprocal.  Although virtually all historians assumed that when Polina was released she returned to live with her husband.  Holroyd-Doveton has discovered a statement by the Italian Communist Vittorio Vidali that he was told by Yelena Dmitryevna at the 20th Congress that Polina refused to return to her husband.  It is hardly surprising.  It is difficult to believe any wife would not be infuriated if they were being tortured while their husband was holding high political office.

Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats of the early years of World War II, which he blamed on Stalin's overly trusting attitude towards Hitler and his purges of the Red Army command structure. As Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had played a leading role in the purges, it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power, and he became the leader of an old guard faction that sought to overthrow Khrushchev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=666\u2013667}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-33241-0001, Moskau, Gala-Vorstellung f\u00fcr BRD-Regierungsdelegation.jpg|thumb|right|Molotov (far left) with Khrushchev (second from right) and Premier [[Nikolai Bulganin]] (to the left of Khrushchev) in 1955 at a gala reception in Moscow for the visit of West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] (centre)]]In June 1956, Molotov was removed as Foreign Minister;{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=245}} on 29 June 1957, he was expelled from the Presidium (Politburo) after a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} Throughout his teen years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\", always assisting his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906, soon gravitating toward that organisation's radical [[Bolshevik]] faction, headed by [[V. I. Lenin]].<ref name=Roberts5>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior.''

In 1911, he enrolled at [[St Petersburg]] Polytechnic. Molotov joined the editorial staff of a new underground Bolshevik newspaper called ''[[Pravda]]'', meeting [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time in association with the project.<ref name=Roberts6>Roberts, ''Molotov'', pg. 6.</ref> This first association between the two future Soviet leaders proved to be brief, however, and did not lead to an immediate close political association.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\n[[File:Molotov VM.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Molotov in 1917]]\n\nMolotov worked as a so-called \"professional revolutionary\" for the next several years, writing for the party press and attempting to better organize the underground party.<ref name=Roberts6 /> He moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1914 at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> It was in Moscow the following year that Molotov was again arrested for his party activity, this time being deported to [[Irkutsk]] in eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> In 1916, he escaped from his Siberian exile and returned to the capital city, now called Petrograd by the Tsarist regime, which thought the name St. Petersburg sounded excessively German.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\nhe was nicknamed \"chav\" by his friends\n\nMolotov became a member of the Bolshevik Party's committee in [[Petrograd]] in 1916.

Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Orgburo]], and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in 1921 and held the office of [[Responsible Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Responsible Secretary]] and also married the Soviet politician [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]].\n\nHis Responsible Secretaryship was criticised by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], with Lenin noting his \"shameful bureaucratism\" and stupid behaviour.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} On the advice of Molotov and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=151}} In 1922, Stalin became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party]] with Molotov as the ''de facto'' [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]].

Molotov became a leading figure in the \"[[Stalinist]] centre\" of the party, which also included [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze|Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=36\u201337}} Trotsky and his supporters underestimated Molotov, as did many others.

He followed Stalin's line by using a combination of force and propaganda to crush peasant resistance to collectivisation, including the deportation of millions of ''[[kulak]]s'' (peasants with property) to [[gulags]]. An enormous number of the deportees died from exposure and overwork.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=47}} He signed the ''[[Law of Spikelets]]''{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=94}} and personally led the Extraordinary Commission for Grain Delivery in Ukraine,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=46}} which seized a reported 4.2&nbsp;million tonnes of grain from the peasants during a widespread manmade [[famine]] (later known as the \"[[Holodomor]]\" to Ukrainians).{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=94}}Contemporary historians estimate that between seven and eleven million people died, either of starvation or in gulags,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=94}}in the process of [[collective farming|farm collectivization]].

Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Hitler's Germany could only develop if Germany's policy changed. Molotov then stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was by re-joining the [[League of Nations]], but even that was not sufficient. Germany still had to give proof 'of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov and the Sovnarkom 1930\u20131941|last=Watson|first=Derek|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> As Litvinov during 1933 and 1934 had done his best to prevent the cordial relations created by Rapallo from declining, some do not think Litvinov would have disapproved of that statement; and if German policy had changed, Litvinov would have been delighted. However, Robert Conquest, unlike Watson, believed that the reason for Stalin's temporary rift with Molotov was not concerned with foreign policy but stemmed from the fact that Stalin was incensed with Molotov for attempting to try and dissuade Stalin from staging the famous trials against the old colleagues of Lenin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Terror|last=Conquest|first=Robert|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref> Molotov, in the same interview, denied the continued existence of internal enemies except for a few isolated cases.

Holroyd-Doveton's biography of Maxim Litvinov.<ref>John Holroyd-Doveton Maxim Litvinov ch 14 p.351-359</ref> Molotov was appointed to succeed him.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} \nRelations between Molotov and Litvinov had been bad,<ref>John Holroyd-Doveton Maxim Litvinov P.488</ref> which is corroborated by a number of sources.  \nMaurice Hindus, in 1954, was perhaps the first person outside the Soviet Union to understand this hostility. In his book ''Crisis in the Kremlin'', he states:\n\n<blockquote>It is well known in Moscow that Molotov always detested Litvinov.  Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.  Litvinov had no respect for a small minded intriguer and accomplice in terror like Molotov, and Molotov for his part had no love for Litvinov, who incidentally was the one people's commissioner to retain his independence.<ref>Medvedev All Stalin's Men p.488</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Purge Stalin Voroshilov Kaganovich Zhdanov Molotov.jpg|thumb|A list from the [[Great Purge]] signed by Molotov, Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]|293x293px]]\n\nMolotov was succeeded in his post as Premier by Stalin.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nAt first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.\n\nThe most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and the [[Baltic States]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of [[Bessarabia]] (then part of [[Romania]], now [[Moldova]]).{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], which began on 1 September.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90\u201392}} On 5 March 1940, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] gave Molotov, along with [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin, a note proposing the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and [[anti-Soviet]]s, in what has become known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nUnder the Pact's terms, Hitler was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy two-thirds of [[Western Poland]], as well as [[Lithuania]]. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the [[Winter War]] that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence.{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=256\u2013257}} The Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland. These annexations led to horrific suffering and loss of life in the countries occupied and partitioned by the two dictatorships.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=320, 322 and 342}}\n\nIn November 1940, Stalin [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks#Molotov travels to Berlin|sent Molotov to Berlin]] to meet Ribbentrop and [[Adolf Hitler]]. In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] visited Turkey in an attempt to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the [[Crimea]]. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that, on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 276\u2013286 }}</ref>\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]]]] \nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158\u2013160}} Molotov was responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war.

He took a secret flight to [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], where he was greeted by Eden. This risky flight, in a high altitude [[Tupolev TB-7]] bomber, flew over German-occupied [[Denmark]] and the [[North Sea]]. From there, he took a train to London to discuss with the [[British government]] the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.\n\nAfter signing the [[Anglo\u2013Soviet Treaty of 1942]] on 26 May, Molotov left for Washington, D.C., in the United States. Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, and ratified a [[Lend-Lease]] Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the [[United States government]], albeit vaguely, promised to open up a second front against Germany.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]]. The plan created several [[bilateral relation]]s between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA).<ref>{{Cite book | author = Roberts, Geoffrey | title = The Soviet Union in world politics: coexistence, revolution, and cold war, 1945\u20131991 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 284\u2013285 | authorlink = Geoffrey Roberts }}</ref>\n\nIn the postwar period, Molotov's power began to decline. A clear sign of his precarious position was his inability to prevent the arrest for \"[[treason]]\", in December 1948, of his Jewish wife, [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]], whom Stalin had long distrusted.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=199\u2013201}} Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening to remind him that, in his own words, \"she suffered because of me\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=604}}\n\nPolina Zhemchuzhina befriended [[Golda Meir]], who arrived in Moscow in November 1948 as the first Israeli envoy to the USSR.<ref>[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]] (1987), ''A History of the Jews'', p. 527</ref> According to a close collaborator of Molotov, [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev]],<ref>V.

Immediately afterwards, Polina was arrested and accused of ties with [[Zionist]] organisations. She was imprisoned for a year in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]], after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed. Polina was freed immediately after the death of Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}} According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: \"She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in the Soviet Union; she's also a real [[Bolshevik]], a real Soviet person.\" \n[[File:Polina Zhemchuzhina.jpg|thumb|Molotov with his wife [[Polina Zhemchuzhina|Polina]]]]\nHowever Polina's feelings were not reciprocal.  Although virtually all historians assumed that when Polina was released she returned to live with her husband.  Holroyd-Doveton has discovered a statement by the Italian Communist Vittorio Vidali that he was told by Yelena Dmitryevna at the 20th Congress that Polina refused to return to her husband.  It is hardly surprising.  It is difficult to believe any wife would not be infuriated if they were being tortured while their husband was holding high political office.

The long-distance trains from Delhi used to ply from three stations namely [[Delhi Junction Railway Station|Delhi Junction]] (Old Delhi), [[New Delhi Railway Station|New Delhi]] and [[Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station]]s. These stations lacked the infrastructure facilities to handle such high passenger rush. Also, Delhi is the connecting station for the cities in the Northern states [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. With increasing passenger pressure at the existing stations, the requirement of additional major passenger terminals was identified by the [[Northern Railway Zone (India)|Northern Railways]]. The East-bound trains from Delhi to the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Jharkhand]] [[West Bengal]] and other [[North East India|North-eastern states]] had to cross the bridge over [[River Yamuna]] as all the three stations are located on the other side of the river. Thus, the area of Anand Vihar was selected in the trans-Yamuna region to construct a mega-railway terminal.<ref name=\"Station3\"/> In 2003, Union railway minister [[Nitish Kumar]] announced that Delhi would get a new rail terminal at Anand Vihar.<ref name=\"Station here\">{{cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=45049|title=With rly station, Anand Vihar is prime property|publisher=cities.expressindia.com|author=Shruti Kohli|date=28 February 2003|accessdate=2009-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030331080253/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=45049|archive-date=31 March 2003|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Station 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/36821396.cms|title=Delhi's biggest railway junction planned at Anand Vihar|publisher=The Times of India|date=8 February 2003|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"Station new1\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-02-27/delhi/27263552_1_railway-station-anand-vihar-d-p-s-sandhu|title=City to get new rail terminal at Anand Vihar|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=27 February 2003|accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref> The station was commissioned in the 2003 rail budget<ref name=\"oldstation\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-03/delhi/28169758_1_rail-overbridge-main-station-building-northern-railway|title=3-in-1 transport hub at Anand Vihar|author=Dwaipayan Ghosh|publisher=The Times of India|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref> and in December 2003, Northern Railway floated a tender to employ consultants for Phase-I of Anand Vihar railway station project.<ref name=\"Station new2\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-12-11/delhi/27198303_1_railway-station-railway-board-northern-railway|title='Model' railway station at Anand Vihar|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=11 December 2003|accessdate=2010-05-10|first1=Nidhi|last1=Sharma}}</ref> The foundation stone of the station was laid by the then Union Minister of Railways, [[Nitish Kumar]] on 25 January 2004.<ref name=\"Stationnew4\">{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=792|title=Railway Minister to lay foundation for Anand Vihar Coaching Terminal|publisher=pib.nic.in|date=23 January 2004|accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> The first phase was expected to be completed by 2006.<ref name=\"Stationnew3\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/468097.cms|title=Anand Vihar on fast track|publisher=The Times of India|date=1 February 2004|accessdate=2010-06-27|first1=S K|last1=Sharma}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nDue to the delay caused by various reasons, the construction was started by the [[Northern Railway Zone (India)|Northern Railways]] in October 2006.<ref name=\"Station2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-153048627.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103065257/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-153048627.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 November 2012|title=Northern Railway has begun construction of a new station at Anand Vihar in Delhi|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=1 October 2006|accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref> The deadline for completion of the first phase was initially mid-2007 which was later revised to March 2008 due to various reasons.

The long-distance trains from Delhi used to ply from three stations namely [[Delhi Junction Railway Station|Delhi Junction]] (Old Delhi), [[New Delhi Railway Station|New Delhi]] and [[Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station]]s. These stations lacked the infrastructure facilities to handle such high passenger rush. Also, Delhi is the connecting station for the cities in the Northern states [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. With increasing passenger pressure at the existing stations, the requirement of additional major passenger terminals was identified by the [[Northern Railway Zone (India)|Northern Railways]]. The East-bound trains from Delhi to the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Jharkhand]] [[West Bengal]] and other [[North East India|North-eastern states]] had to cross the bridge over [[River Yamuna]] as all the three stations are located on the other side of the river.
