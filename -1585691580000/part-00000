Incidents have included crimes against people, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and stalking; crimes affecting both people and property, such as arson or bombing; and property crimes such as vandalism. Perpetrators may defend their actions as necessary to protect fetuses, and are often motivated by their Christian beliefs, leading to anti-abortion violence's identification as [[Christian terrorism]]; it is also associated with [[antifeminism]].<ref>Petchesky, Rosalind Pollack. \"Antiabortion, Antifeminism, and the Rise of the New Right.\" Feminist Studies, vol. 7, no. 2, 1981, pp. 206\u2013246.

While many of these attacks have historically been directed at [[Cuba]] and the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] government, many of them occurred domestically, especially during the period of Cuba-US diplomacy and negotiations in the 1970s known as \"el Di\u00e1logo\" (the dialogue) when powerful anti-Castro figures in Miami attempted to terrorize those in their community who favored a more moderate approach. Luciano Nieves, for instance, was killed for advocating peaceful coexistence with Cuba. WQBA-AM news director Emilio Milian lost his legs in a car bomb after he publicly condemned Cuban exile violence. These cases of terrorism were documented extensively in the book ''[[Miami (book)|Miami]]'' by [[Joan Didion]]. Human Rights Watch released a report in 1992 in which it claimed that the more extreme exiles have created a political environment in Miami where \"moderation can be a dangerous position.\"\n\n===Animal Liberation Front===\n{{Main article|Animal Liberation Front}}\nAnimal Liberation Front (ALF) is a name used internationally by activists who engage in [[direct action]] against persons and/or organizations which the activists perceive are harming animals. This includes removing animals from laboratories and fur farms, and sabotaging facilities involved in animal testing and other animal-based industries. According to ALF statements, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to endanger life, may be claimed as an ALF action.\n\n===Army of God===\n{{Main article|Army of God (United States)}}\nThe Army of God (AOG)<ref>{{cite web|author=Rev.

Letters sent to newspapers claim responsibility for the bombing of the abortion clinics in the name of the Army of God.\n\n===Aryan Nations===\n{{Main article|Aryan Nations}}\nAryan Nations (AN) is a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organization founded in the 1970s by [[Richard Girnt Butler]] as an arm of the [[Christian Identity]] group known as the [[Church of Jesus Christ-Christian]].

Atomwaffen also draws influence from Nazi esotericism and the occult. The group has about 80 full members and a \"large\" amount of initiates and 20 cells across 23 states in America. The organization also has a [[United Kingdom]] branch called the Sonnenkrieg Division (SKD), a [[Baltic states|Baltic]] branch called Feuerkrieg Division (FKD), a presence in [[Canada]] by a group called Northern Order and one located in [[Germany]]. The organization has been responsible for the deaths of eight people most notably the [[Murder of Blaze Bernstein]] a gay Jewish California student and the killings of Jeremy Himmelman and Andrew Oneschuk.\n\n===Black Liberation Army===\n{{Main article|Black Liberation Army}}\nA splinter group made up of the more radical members of the [[Black Panther Party]], the Black Liberation Army (BLA) sought to overthrow the US government in the name of racial separatism and Marxist ideals. The [[Fraternal Order of Police]] blames the BLA for the murders of 13 police officers.

The group was originally known as the [[New York City|New York]] chapter of the [[Prairie Fire Organizing Committee]] (PFOC), an organization devoted to legally promoting the causes of the Weather Underground. This was part of Prairie Fire Manifesto change in Weather Underground Organization strategy, which demanded both aboveground mass and clandestine organizations. The role of the clandestine organization would be to build the  \"consciousness of action\" and prepare the way for the development of a people's militia.  Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above ground Prairie Fire Collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, \"help create the 'sea' for the guerrillas to swim in.\"<ref>\n{{cite book |title=  The Way The Wind Blew: A History Of The Weather Underground\n|last=  Jacobs |first=  Ron\n|year= 1997\n|publisher=  Verso\n|isbn= 1-85984-167-8 |pages=  76\u201377\n|url= https://archive.org/stream/TheWayTheWindBlewAHistoryOfTheWeatherUnderground/waythewindblew_djvu.txt\n|accessdate=  December 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The Order===\n{{Main article|The Order (white supremacist group)}}\nThe Order, also known as the Br\u00fcder Schweigen or Silent Brotherhood, was a white nationalist revolutionary group active in the United States between 1983 and 1984.

It is also marked by [[anti-Semitism]], anti-[[multiculturalism]], and opposition to [[taxation]]. It is not considered an organization because it is not led by a governing body, there are no gatherings, and there is no membership process. One becomes a Phineas Priest by simply adopting the beliefs of the Priesthood and acting upon those beliefs.

Shown is the [[crown (headgear)|terraced crown]] of the [[Chrysler Building]] lit at dawn.]]\n\nA '''central business district''' ('''CBD''') is the commercial and business center of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"[[city center|city centre]]\" or \"[[downtown]]\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central ''business'' district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown, or even several CBDs at once. In [[London]], for example, the \"city centre\" is usually regarded as encompassing the historic [[City of London]] and the mediaeval [[City of Westminster]], whereas the [[City of London]] and the transformed [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area are regarded as its two CBDs. In [[New York City]], [[Midtown Manhattan]] is the largest central business district in the city and in the world; yet [[Lower Manhattan]], commonly called ''Downtown Manhattan'', represents the second largest, and second, distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown. In [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Loop]] is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. [[Mexico City]] also has a historic city centre, the colonial-era [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]], along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century [[Paseo de la Reforma]] \u2013 [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]], and the new [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong [[Historic preservation|preservation]] laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as [[Paris]] or [[Vienna]]. In cities in the [[New World]] that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as [[Road transport|road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] transport, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 21st century have developed [[Megacity|megacities]], particularly in [[Asia]], that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers.<ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RSRQGRD Reviving American downtowns]\".

It is located within [[Gaborone]].\n\n== Canada==\n[[File:Toronto Financial District August 2017.jpg|thumb|Skyscrapers in [[downtown Toronto]], Canada]]\nIn Canada, central business districts are referred to as \"downtown\" or the \"downtown core\" and are mostly highlighted by skyscrapers. In [[Quebec]] and the rest of [[French Canada]], they are known as {{lang|fr|centre-ville}}. [[Toronto]] has [[Downtown Toronto]] (the largest in Canada), which includes the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] of Canada, major sporting and entertainment venues, educational institutions and multiple corporate headquarters. Additional central business districts in Toronto's divisions [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] serve their respective populations as local commercial areas. [[Midtown Toronto]] is another secondary central business district that rapidly developed during the 20th century from initially being a suburb. Toronto's surrounding suburban cities of [[Mississauga]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] contain developed or developing central business districts.\n\nOther major Canadian cities, including [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] also contain downtown districts with skyscrapers above 200 metres in height. Cities, such as [[Quebec City]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Ottawa]], mostly contain downtowns with cultural and heritage landmarks which restrict the heights of developments.\n\n== Mainland China ==\n[[File:Lujiazui 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Lujiazui]], [[Shanghai]]]]\n[[File:Guomao Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing CBD]], [[Beijing]]]]\n\nIn China terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are used but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52a1\u533a) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8d38\u6613\u533a) may exist. Large Chinese cities typically have multiple CBDs spread throughout the urban area. Cities traditionally being major cultural centres with many historic structures in the core such as [[Beijing]], [[Suzhou]] or [[Xi'an]] will have the [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built adjacent to the urban core, similar to European cities. While other cities such as [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Wuhan]] the city centre will typically house a number of CBDs in addition to [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built in the periphery.\n\n== France ==\nIn [[France]], the term {{lang|fr|quartier d\u2019affaires}} may be used to describe the central business district. The main business districts in the country are as follows:\n\n* [[La D\u00e9fense]] in [[Paris]], which with 3,300,000 square meters of office space is Europe's leading business district in terms of area.\n* [[La Part-Dieu]] in [[Lyon]], is the 2nd largest business district in France and has nearly 1,600,000 square metres.\n* [[Euralille]] in [[Lille]], is the 3rd business district of France with 1,120,000 square metres of offices.\n* [[Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] in [[Marseille]], is the 4th business district in France with 650,000 square metres of offices.\n\n== Germany ==\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Stadtansicht von der Deutschherrnbruecke zu Beginn der Abenddaemmerung.jpg|thumb|Central business district of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]]]\nIn [[Germany]], the terms ''Innenstadt'' and ''Stadtzentrum'' may be used to describe the central business district. Both terms can be literally translated to mean \"[[inner city]]\" and \"city centre\". Some of the [[metropolitan regions in Germany|larger cities]] have more than one central business district, like [[Berlin]], which has three.\n\nDue to Berlin's history of division during the [[Cold War]], the city contains central business districts both in West ([[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]]) and East Berlin ([[Alexanderplatz]]), as well as a newly built business centre near [[Potsdamer Platz]]. The city's historic centre \u2013 the location of the [[Reichstag building]], as well as the [[Brandenburg gate]] and most federal ministries \u2013 was largely abandoned when the [[Berlin Wall]] cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of [[Potsdamer Platz]], and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.\n\nIn [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], there is a business district which is in the geographical centre of the city and it is called the [[Bankenviertel]].\n\n<br />\n[[File:Frankfurt Central Business District.jpg|alt=Central Business District of Frankfurt am Main|border|center|thumb|316x316px|The Central Business District in the German city of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Central District Night View 201305.jpg|thumb|[[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] has been the political and financial centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]].]]\n\nIn [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], there is a business district which is located around the famous High-Street [[K\u00f6nigsallee]] with banks, shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/mischung-macht-das-zentrum-einzigartig-aid-1.4753856 |title=D\u00fcsseldorfs Central Business District: Mischung macht das Zentrum einzigartig |author=Thorsten Breitkopf |work=RP ONLINE |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong ==\n[[File:Kwun Tong Dusk View 201407.jpg|thumb|Kwun Tong-Kowloon Bay CBD of [[Kowloon East (constituency)|East Kowloon]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (15512862984).jpg|thumb|[[West Kowloon]] CBD]]\nIn [[Hong Kong]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Sheung Wan]], [[Wan Chai|Wanchai]] and [[Causeway Bay]] are considered as the central business districts of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]]. The [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] has generally been considered the city centre of [[Kowloon]] before another core emerged in [[Cheung Sha Wan]].\n\nAs part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], the [[Union Square (Hong Kong)|Union Square]] project launched by the MTR Corporation has brought it another CBD in [[West Kowloon]]. With the latest implementation of \"Energising Kowloon East\" Scheme by the Hong Kong Government, [[Kowloon Bay]] and [[Kwun Tong]] Business Area have been gradually redeveloped and transformed into CBDs.\n\nThe CBDs of new towns and satellite cities such as [[Tuen Mun]], [[Sha Tin]] and [[Tung Chung]] have been characterised by sky-scraping residential blocks on top of large shopping centres that provide services to local residents. These mixed use development usually surround the central public transit station of such towns.\n\n== Indonesia ==\nThe largest CBD in Indonesia is known as the [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Golden Triangle]] (''Segitiga Emas'' in [[Indonesian language]]) in [[Jakarta]]. The area is located along the main avenues of Jakarta, [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman]] \u2013 [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin]] -[[Jalan H.R. Rasuna Said]] \u2013 [[Jalan Prof. Dr. Satrio]] \u2013 [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto]]. [[SCBD|Sudirman Central Business District]], a super block that is located within the Golden Triangle, is the first of its kind in Indonesia, and one of the largest commercial center development in the city. Jakarta started developing the sophistication of its Business District in the early 1960s before to host the [[1962 Asian Games|Asian Games in 1962]].<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/06/22/sukarno-s-vision-a-modern-capital.html thejakartapost.com]; Sukarno's vision of a modern capital</ref>\n\n[[Surabaya]] in [[East Java]], built its first central business district in the Darmo region. The construction was expected to be completed by 2018 with 150 SOHO units and 500 residences.<ref>[http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2015/12/03/056724461/Surabaya-to-See-First-Central-Business-District tempo.co]; Surabaya to See First Central Business District</ref>\n{{wide image|Jakarta WV banner.jpg|1000px|Jakarta Central Business District}}\n\n== Pakistan ==\nIn Pakistan, a central business district or a large, concentrated urban setting within a settlement is called a ''shehar''. [[Karachi]] is Pakistan's largest city and the country's economic hub; the [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]] of the city, often called the \"Wall Street of Pakistan,\" acts as Karachi's main financial district and is essentially a center of economic and industrial activity.

The [[Paseo de la Castellana]] holds the city's main business districts: the [[Gate of Europe]], [[AZCA]] and [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]]. AZCA is 19-hectare super block near [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] stadium [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. It used to be the country's main business area during the 1980s and 1990s, when most of its skyscrapers were built. The tallest building of AZCA is the [[Torre Picasso]], a 158-tower designed by the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center's]] architect, and contains the main offices in Spain of [[Google]] and [[Deloitte]]. The Gate of Europe consists of two twin towers, which hold Spanish bank [[Bankia]] and real state company Realia. Just a few blocks north is the CTBA, a complex of four skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain. Architects such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Cesar Pelli]] have designed its towers, which were completed in 2008. The tallest building, the [[Torre de Cristal]], is the fourth tallest building is [[Western Europe]], with a height of 250 metres. The complex is home to offices from well known companies such as [[KPMG]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Bankia]], [[Cepsa]], [[Pwc]], [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] and holds the embassies of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], Canada and [[Australia]], as well as a 5-star hotel from [[Eurostars Hotels|Eurostars]].

In 2005, the [[Torre Agbar]], designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], became the third tallest building in the city with a height of 145 metres.

There are many central business districts located on the island of [[Taiwan]]. In [[Taipei]], the capital city of [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]), the area around its [[Taipei Station|main railway station]] or [[Zhongzheng District]] is regarded as the historic city centre whilst the [[Xinyi District]](especially [[Xinyi Special District]]) or [[Eastern District of Taipei]] located to the east of the said railway station is the current CBD of Taipei, being both the modern financial, political and economic district and the premier shopping area, including the location of [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan's tallest building, rising {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}}.\n\nIn the southern [[Taiwan]]ese city of [[Kaohsiung]], the main CBDs are [[Cianjin District]] and [[Lingya District]]; and in the central Taiwanese metropolitan area of [[Taichung]], the CBD is [[Xitun District]], especially [[Taichung's 7th Redevelopment Zone]], in which most high-rise buildings containing offices are concentrated.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 02.jpg|thumb|One of two CBDs in London, [[Canary Wharf]] is slightly to the east of London's centre.]]\n[[File:The city of london 2019.jpg|thumb|[[City of London|The City]] in central London]]\nThe alternative term ''city centre'' is used in United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In British-influenced countries, such as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth realms]], former British territories, also use many of the same terms, but also have many characteristics of British cities. In the UK, Australia and South Africa, the term is often just shortened to \"city\", as in \"going to the city\"; it is often also called \"town\" (\"going (in)to town\", \"going up town\", or \"going down town\"). One exception is in [[London]] where \"the City\" specifically refers to the [[City of London]] (one of the two main financial districts), rather than to any other part of [[London]].\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline from Edgbaston Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham]] city centre's skyline, as seen from [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]]]]\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:Lower Manhattan viewed from Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City. [[One World Trade Center]] is the tallest [[skyscraper]] in the Western Hemisphere.]]\n\nIn the United States, central business districts are often called \"downtown\" (even if there is no \"uptown\"). In most cities the downtown area will be home to the financial district, but usually contains entertainment and retail of some kind as well. The downtown areas of many cities, such as [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Houston]], are also home to large sports and convention venues. Historic sections of a central business district may be called \"old town\", while decaying parts of the centre city are commonly called the \"[[inner city]]\". The term ''inner city'' is sometimes used evocatively, applying a negative connotation and referring to peripheral areas that suffered economically from [[white flight]].\n\nSome cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], have [[Mixed-use development|mixed use]] districts known as \"uptown\" in addition to the primary downtown core areas. In some cities, such as [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], \"uptown\" is instead the historic name for a separate business center or neighbourhood. [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] use the term ''Center City'' instead of ''downtown'' for their central business districts as well as most of the cities and towns in the northwest states. In other cities, like [[Los Angeles]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Omaha]], the city core is simply known as \"downtown\".  [[Jacksonville, Florida]] refers to its central business district as the [[Downtown Jacksonville|Urban Core]], a term which is also sometimes applied to its denser surrounding neighborhoods.  In [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the phrase [[Central Business District, New Orleans|central business district]] is used; and while ''downtown'' is sometimes used synonymously, traditionally it referred to parts of the city downriver from [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], which did not include the CBD.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Business improvement district]]\n* [[Downtown]]\n* [[List of central business districts]]\n* [[Peak land value intersection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cities}}\n\n[[Category:Central business districts| ]]\n[[Category:City]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Commercial and business centre of a city}}\n{{redirect|Central Business District|the historic city center in Miami|Central Business District (Miami)|other districts|List of central business districts}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n {{original research|date=September 2015}}\n {{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n {{Globalize|date=December 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Midtown Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], the largest central business district in the world. Shown is the [[crown (headgear)|terraced crown]] of the [[Chrysler Building]] lit at dawn.]]\n\nA '''central business district''' ('''CBD''') is the commercial and business center of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"[[city center|city centre]]\" or \"[[downtown]]\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central ''business'' district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown, or even several CBDs at once. In [[London]], for example, the \"city centre\" is usually regarded as encompassing the historic [[City of London]] and the mediaeval [[City of Westminster]], whereas the [[City of London]] and the transformed [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area are regarded as its two CBDs. In [[New York City]], [[Midtown Manhattan]] is the largest central business district in the city and in the world; yet [[Lower Manhattan]], commonly called ''Downtown Manhattan'', represents the second largest, and second, distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown. In [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Loop]] is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. [[Mexico City]] also has a historic city centre, the colonial-era [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]], along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century [[Paseo de la Reforma]] \u2013 [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]], and the new [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong [[Historic preservation|preservation]] laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as [[Paris]] or [[Vienna]]. In cities in the [[New World]] that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as [[Road transport|road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] transport, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 21st century have developed [[Megacity|megacities]], particularly in [[Asia]], that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers.<ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RSRQGRD Reviving American downtowns]\".

In [[Quebec]] and the rest of [[French Canada]], they are known as {{lang|fr|centre-ville}}. [[Toronto]] has [[Downtown Toronto]] (the largest in Canada), which includes the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] of Canada, major sporting and entertainment venues, educational institutions and multiple corporate headquarters. Additional central business districts in Toronto's divisions [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] serve their respective populations as local commercial areas. [[Midtown Toronto]] is another secondary central business district that rapidly developed during the 20th century from initially being a suburb. Toronto's surrounding suburban cities of [[Mississauga]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] contain developed or developing central business districts.\n\nOther major Canadian cities, including [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] also contain downtown districts with skyscrapers above 200 metres in height. Cities, such as [[Quebec City]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Ottawa]], mostly contain downtowns with cultural and heritage landmarks which restrict the heights of developments.\n\n== Mainland China ==\n[[File:Lujiazui 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Lujiazui]], [[Shanghai]]]]\n[[File:Guomao Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing CBD]], [[Beijing]]]]\n\nIn China terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are used but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52a1\u533a) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8d38\u6613\u533a) may exist. Large Chinese cities typically have multiple CBDs spread throughout the urban area. Cities traditionally being major cultural centres with many historic structures in the core such as [[Beijing]], [[Suzhou]] or [[Xi'an]] will have the [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built adjacent to the urban core, similar to European cities. While other cities such as [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Wuhan]] the city centre will typically house a number of CBDs in addition to [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built in the periphery.\n\n== France ==\nIn [[France]], the term \"quartier d\u2019affaires\" may be used to describe the central business district. The main business districts in the country are as follows:\n\n* [[La D\u00e9fense]] in [[Paris]], which with 3,300,000 square meters of office space is Europe's leading business district in terms of area.\n* [[La Part-Dieu]] in [[Lyon]], is the 2nd largest business district in France and has nearly 1,600,000 square metres.\n* [[Euralille]] in [[Lille]], is the 3rd business district of France with 1,120,000 square metres of offices.\n* [[Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] in [[Marseille]], is the 4th business district in France with 650,000 square metres of offices.\n\n== Germany ==\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Stadtansicht von der Deutschherrnbruecke zu Beginn der Abenddaemmerung.jpg|thumb|Central business district of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]]]\nIn [[Germany]], the terms ''Innenstadt'' and ''Stadtzentrum'' may be used to describe the central business district. Both terms can be literally translated to mean \"[[inner city]]\" and \"city centre\". Some of the [[metropolitan regions in Germany|larger cities]] have more than one central business district, like [[Berlin]], which has three.\n\nDue to Berlin's history of division during the [[Cold War]], the city contains central business districts both in West ([[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]]) and East Berlin ([[Alexanderplatz]]), as well as a newly built business centre near [[Potsdamer Platz]]. The city's historic centre \u2013 the location of the [[Reichstag building]], as well as the [[Brandenburg gate]] and most federal ministries \u2013 was largely abandoned when the [[Berlin Wall]] cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of [[Potsdamer Platz]], and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.\n\nIn [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], there is a business district which is in the geographical centre of the city and it is called the [[Bankenviertel]].\n\n<br />\n[[File:Frankfurt Central Business District.jpg|alt=Central Business District of Frankfurt am Main|border|center|thumb|316x316px|The Central Business District in the German city of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Central District Night View 201305.jpg|thumb|[[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] has been the political and financial centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]].]]\n\nIn [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], there is a business district which is located around the famous High-Street [[K\u00f6nigsallee]] with banks, shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/mischung-macht-das-zentrum-einzigartig-aid-1.4753856 |title=D\u00fcsseldorfs Central Business District: Mischung macht das Zentrum einzigartig |author=Thorsten Breitkopf |work=RP ONLINE |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong ==\n[[File:Kwun Tong Dusk View 201407.jpg|thumb|Kwun Tong-Kowloon Bay CBD of [[Kowloon East (constituency)|East Kowloon]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (15512862984).jpg|thumb|[[West Kowloon]] CBD]]\nIn [[Hong Kong]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Sheung Wan]], [[Wan Chai|Wanchai]] and [[Causeway Bay]] are considered as the central business districts of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]].

[[Karachi]] is Pakistan's largest city and the country's economic hub; the [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]] of the city, often called the \"Wall Street of Pakistan,\" acts as Karachi's main financial district and is essentially a center of economic and industrial activity. [[Shahrah-e-Faisal|Shahra-e-Faisal]] in Karachi is also one of the most important business districts of Pakistan.\n\nAnother important business district is [[Gulberg, Lahore]]. It has a large number of important office buildings as well as many high-rises and shopping malls.

The [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA), Ayala Land, Inc. and Evergreen Holdings, Inc. controls Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation, which oversees the master planning of Bonifacio Global City. [[Ortigas Center]] (middle), with an area of more than {{convert|100|ha}}, is the Philippines' second most important business district after the [[Makati CBD]] and is home to [[Asian Development Bank]]. Meanwhile, the [[Makati Central Business District]] (bottom), also known as the '''Makati CBD''', is the leading financial and the largest central business district in the Philippines.\n\n== Singapore ==\n[[File:1 Singapore city skyline 2010 day panorama.jpg|thumb|The Downtown Core and the Singapore River Planning Area as viewed from the eastern bank of the [[Singapore River]], with the CBD located on its western bank.

Its densest point is centered around [[Raffles Place]], where most of Singapore's skyscrapers are located.

The [[Paseo de la Castellana]] holds the city's main business districts: the [[Gate of Europe]], [[AZCA]] and [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]]. AZCA is 19-hectare super block near [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] stadium [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. It used to be the country's main business area during the 1980s and 1990s, when most of its skyscrapers were built. The tallest building of AZCA is the [[Torre Picasso]], a 158-tower designed by the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center's]] architect, and contains the main offices in Spain of [[Google]] and [[Deloitte]]. The Gate of Europe consists of two twin towers, which hold Spanish bank [[Bankia]] and real state company Realia. Just a few blocks north is the CTBA, a complex of four skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain. Architects such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Cesar Pelli]] have designed its towers, which were completed in 2008. The tallest building, the [[Torre de Cristal]], is the fourth tallest building is [[Western Europe]], with a height of 250 metres. The complex is home to offices from well known companies such as [[KPMG]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Bankia]], [[Cepsa]], [[Pwc]], [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] and holds the embassies of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], Canada and [[Australia]], as well as a 5-star hotel from [[Eurostars Hotels|Eurostars]]. A fifth tower is currently being built and will have the campus of the [[Instituto de Empresa]] university.\n[[File:Central business district of Barcelona (2).JPG|thumb|[[22@]] centre in Barcelona]]\nIn [[Barcelona]], the [[22@]], [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran Via]] and [[Granvia l'Hospitalet]] are the main business districts. Despite the fact that the Catalan capital does not have a reputation for skyscrapers and financial hubs, in the recent years it has attracted several media and technology companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Yahoo!]]. In 2005, the [[Torre Agbar]], designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], became the third tallest building in the city with a height of 145 metres. The building soon became a symbol of Barcelona and was going to become a [[Hyatt]] hotel. However, the tower is still empty due to administrative problems.<ref name=\"lavanguardia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20170212/414267936478/bloqueo-municipal-venta-torre-agbar-virgin-hotels.html |website=La Vanguardia |title=El hotel que no pudo ser |accessdate=2017-08-11}}</ref>\n\nCities like [[Bilbao]] and [[Valencia]] are also considered to have important business districts but at a much smaller scale. Bilbao has completely transformed its city centre in the last 20 years, and now holds several main offices of banks like [[BBVA]] and [[Kutxabank]] as well as the [[Iberdrola Tower]], a 165-metre skyscraper which belongs to Spanish electric company [[Iberdrola]].\n\n== Taiwan ==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Taipei, Taiwan CBD Skyline.jpg|[[Taipei]]'s CBD \u2013 [[Xinyi District]]'s skyline, with [[Taipei 101]] in the background\nFile:Kaohsiung Skyline 2020.jpg|[[Kaohsiung]] \u2013 second largest city in [[Taiwan]], containing many CBDs\nFile:\u7531\u81fa\u4e2d\u6e2f\u8def\u3001\u5b89\u548c\u8def\u53e3\u5929\u6a4b \u5f80\u6771\u770b\u65b0\u5e02\u653f\u5c08\u7528\u5340\u30102015\u5e741\u6708\u3011.JPG|[[Taichung]] cityscape in Taiwan\n</gallery>\n\nIn Taiwan, terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are often used, but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52d9\u5340) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8cbf\u6613\u5340) or \"Yolk area\" (\u86cb\u9ec3\u5340) are also frequently used. There are many central business districts located on the island of [[Taiwan]]. In [[Taipei]], the capital city of [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]), the area around its [[Taipei Station|main railway station]] or [[Zhongzheng District]] is regarded as the historic city centre whilst the [[Xinyi District]](especially [[Xinyi Special District]]) or [[Eastern District of Taipei]] located to the east of the said railway station is the current CBD of Taipei, being both the modern financial, political and economic district and the premier shopping area, including the location of [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan's tallest building, rising {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}}.\n\nIn the southern [[Taiwan]]ese city of [[Kaohsiung]], the main CBDs are [[Cianjin District]] and [[Lingya District]]; and in the central Taiwanese metropolitan area of [[Taichung]], the CBD is [[Xitun District]], especially [[Taichung's 7th Redevelopment Zone]], in which most high-rise buildings containing offices are concentrated.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 02.jpg|thumb|One of two CBDs in London, [[Canary Wharf]] is slightly to the east of London's centre.]]\n[[File:The city of london 2019.jpg|thumb|[[City of London|The City]] in central London]]\nThe alternative term ''city centre'' is used in United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In British-influenced countries, such as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth realms]], former British territories, also use many of the same terms, but also have many characteristics of British cities. In the UK, Australia and South Africa, the term is often just shortened to \"city\", as in \"going to the city\"; it is often also called \"town\" (\"going (in)to town\", \"going up town\", or \"going down town\"). One exception is in [[London]] where \"the City\" specifically refers to the [[City of London]] (one of the two main financial districts), rather than to any other part of [[London]].\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline from Edgbaston Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham]] city centre's skyline, as seen from [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]]]]\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:Lower Manhattan viewed from Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City. [[One World Trade Center]] is the tallest [[skyscraper]] in the Western Hemisphere.]]\n\nIn the United States, central business districts are often called \"downtown\" (even if there is no \"uptown\"). In most cities the downtown area will be home to the financial district, but usually contains entertainment and retail of some kind as well. The downtown areas of many cities, such as [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Houston]], are also home to large sports and convention venues. Historic sections of a central business district may be called \"old town\", while decaying parts of the centre city are commonly called the \"[[inner city]]\". The term ''inner city'' is sometimes used evocatively, applying a negative connotation and referring to peripheral areas that suffered economically from [[white flight]].\n\nSome cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], have [[Mixed-use development|mixed use]] districts known as \"uptown\" in addition to the primary downtown core areas. In some cities, such as [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], \"uptown\" is instead the historic name for a separate business center or neighbourhood. [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] use the term ''Center City'' instead of ''downtown'' for their central business districts as well as most of the cities and towns in the northwest states. In other cities, like [[Los Angeles]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Omaha]], the city core is simply known as \"downtown\".  [[Jacksonville, Florida]] refers to its central business district as the [[Downtown Jacksonville|Urban Core]], a term which is also sometimes applied to its denser surrounding neighborhoods.

The performance brought attention of the general manager of the Stadttheater in [[Ulm]], and eventually led to Karajan's first appointment as assistant ''[[Kapellmeister]]'' of the theater.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Osborne 2000\" /> His senior colleague in Ulm was [[Otto Schulmann]]. After Schulmann was forced to leave Germany in 1933 with the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] take-over, Karajan was promoted to first ''Kapellmeister''. \n\n====The Nazi Years====\n\nIn the postwar era Karajan maintained a silence about his Nazi Party membership which gave rise to a number of conflicting stories regarding it.  One version asserts that because of the changing political climate and the destabilization of his position, Karajan attempted to join the Nazi Party in Salzburg in April 1933, though his membership was later declared invalid for he somehow failed to follow up the application<ref name=\"Osborne 2000\" /> and that Karajan formally joined the Nazi Party in Aachen in 1935, implying that he was not eager to pursue membership.  More recent scholarship clears up this confusion: \"[t]he truth is that Karajan actually joined the Nazi Party twice. The first time this happened was on 8 April 1933 in Salzburg. He paid the admission fee, received the membership number 1607525 and moved to Ulm. It is said that this accession was never formally carried out. It is also certain that Karajan rejoined the Nazi Party in Aachen in March 1935, this time receiving the membership number 3430914. After the annexation of Austria, the responsible Reich Treasurer of the Nazi Party discovered Karajan's double membership in Munich and declared the first accession invalid. The second was made retroactive to 1 May 1933.\"<ref name=zweimal>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article1595506/Der-Mann-der-zweimal-in-die-NSDAP-eintrat.html|title=Der Mann, der zweimal in die NSDAP eintrat|trans-title=The Man Who Joined the NSDAP Twice|last=Kammholz|first=Karsten|date=26 January 2008|work=[[Die Welt]]|access-date=27 March 2020|quote=Zu Lebzeiten wollte sich der Stardirigent nie der Tatsache stellen, Mitglied der NSDAP gewesen zu sein.

A statement from his Salzburg office stated that Karajan was \"very shocked, affected, and deeply upset by the news.

She was the daughter of a well-known manufacturer of yarn for sewing machines. Having had a Jewish grandfather, she was considered a ''Viertelj\u00fcdin'' (one-quarter Jewish woman). They divorced in 1958.\n\nOn 6 October 1958, Karajan remarried. His third wife was {{ill|Eliette von Karajan|de|lt=Eliette Mouret}}, a French model born in [[Mollans-sur-Ouv\u00e8ze]]. She had enjoyed a carefree childhood growing up in Provence before being discovered by [[Christian Dior]] when she was just 19 years old. This laid the foundation for an international modelling career. Karajan had first met Mouret in 1957, and was deeply taken with her. Their first daughter, [[Isabel Karajan|Isabel]], was born on 25 June 1960. In 1964, their second daughter, Arabel, was born.\n\nAfter the death of Herbert von Karajan in July 1989, Eliette von Karajan continued her husband's musical legacy. With the founding of the Herbert von Karajan Centre in [[Vienna]], now situated in [[Salzburg]] and known as the Eliette and Herbert von Karajan Institute, she created a cultural memorial dedicated to Karajan that has established itself during the years of its existence as an essential part of the local cultural scene. Her numerous projects, focusing particularly on the development of young people, and her engagement as patron of the [[Salzburg Easter Festival]], mean that Eliette von Karajan is ensuring that her husband's work is still heard long after his death, remaining a living thing for generations to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eliette-von-karajan.org/jart/prj3/evk/main.jart?rel=en&content-id=1263562339588|title=Eliette Mouret \u2013 Biography|website=eliette-von-karajan.org}}</ref>\n\n==== Hobbies ====\n[[File:Herbert von Karajan 1963.jpg|thumb|Karajan at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]], 1963]]\n[[File:KarajanPorsche1.jpg|thumb|Karajan's custom-built Porsche]]\nHerbert von Karajan was a passionate sportsman since he was a teenager: a passionate skier and swimmer, he even followed a daily yoga ritual. He was also a great sailing and car enthusiast, in particular an amateur of Porsche. He commissioned a unique and tailored model in 1975, a 911 Turbo which still carries his name to this day.\n\nKarajan put the same meticulous attention to detail that made him a master of ''Nibelungen'' productions into the design of his cars. When he contacted the [[Porsche]] special order department in 1974 about a new [[Porsche 930|Type 930]], he made it absolutely clear that he wanted a lighter and more sports-oriented version of the standard production vehicle. Karajan dictated that the car should weigh less than one thousand kilograms and its power-to-weight ratio should be well under four kilos per hp\u2014no easy task, given that the standard version was already at 1,140 kilos and 260 hp. The Porsche CEO at the time, [[Ernst Fuhrmann]], carried out the special wishes of his prominent customer himself. Karajan's Turbo was given the racing chassis of an RSR and the body of a Carrera RS, along with a racing suspension and rollover bars. The interior was rigorously stripped down. The backseat was replaced by a steel roll cage, while the radio and any symphonies it might have played gave way to the harmonies of the flat-six engine, which could mobilize around 100 more hp thanks to a larger turbocharger and a sharper camshaft. Lightweight construction even extended to replacing the door handles with slim leather straps that opened the catch when pulled. And Porsche specifically requested permission from [[Martini & Rossi|Rossi]], the vermouth producer, to replicate the Martini racing paint job from the 911 Carrera RSR Turbo 2.1 that finished second in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Siep |first1=Lena |title=Karajan's unique Porsche |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/christophorus/issue-382/porsche-911-turbo-rs-maestro-herbert-von-karajan-salzburg-13945.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |accessdate=2019-09-30 |date=25 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt sea, Karajan won several regattas aboard his racing yachts baptised ''Helisara''.\n\n== Musicianship ==\nOne of Karajan's signature skills as a conductor was his ability to extract exquisite sounds from orchestras. His biographer Roger Vaughan observed this phenomenon while listening to the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] play in 1986, after nearly 30 years under Karajan's direction, noting that \"what rivets one's attention is the beauty and perfection of the sounds. The softest of pianissimos commands rapt attention. The smooth crescendos peak exactly when they should. The breaks are sliced clean, without the slightest ragged edge.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Herbert von Karajan : a biographical portrait |last=Vaughan |first=Roger |date=1985 |publisher=W.W.

This was, and is, highly unusual for a conductor to do on anything but occasion, as eye-contact is generally regarded as of paramount importance to the conductor's communication with the orchestra's players. Yet, as Vaughan wryly remarks, \"[h]ere is one of the fascinating aspects of conducting: there are no rules, only guidelines. The most eccentric approach is tolerated if the results are successful.\"<ref name=\"Includes index\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/herbertvonkaraja00roge/page/19|title=Herbert von Karajan : a biographical portrait|last=Vaughan|first=Roger|date=1985|publisher=W.W.

Indeed, [[James Galway]], who served as principal flutist of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] from 1969 to 1975, recalled that \"he [Karajan] achieved most of what wanted through charm.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/herbertvonkaraja00roge/page/22|title=Herbert von Karajan : a biographical portrait|last=Vaughan|first=Roger|date=1985|publisher=W.W.

Conducting with his eyes closed, for instance, was viewed as a necessary consequence of memorizing scores, as with that out of the way, there was nothing else to look out.<ref name=\"Includes index\" /> Karajan's method of score study, too, was somewhat unusual, as was noted by his friend [[Walter Legge]], who remarked that \"He [Karajan] is one of the few conductors I have known who has never made a mark in a score. He will absorb a score quietly sitting on the floor, like a relaxed Siamese cat. Over the years he has learned how completely to relax the body so the mind is absolutely free to do what it wants.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=95}} Karajan was also known to have a preternaturally keen sense of tempo, even going so far as to have himself tested against a computer to prove it. He insisted that this skill was learned, not inherited, and considered it the bedrock of musical interpretations. In fact, he cited inconsistencies in rhythmic accuracy and control as \"one thing that might make me lose my temper. I can accept a wrong note from an orchestra but when everything is getting faster or slower, that I cannot accept.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=96}}\n\nHe once explained to a German journalist why he preferred the Berlin to the Vienna Philharmonic. \"If I tell the Berliners to step forward, they do it.  If I tell the Viennese to step forward, they do it. But then they ask why.\"<ref>Norman Lebrecht, The Book of Musical Anecdotes, the Free Press, New York, 1985 p. 326</ref>\n\n=== Musical tastes ===\nKarajan was a noted interpreter of virtually every standard of the classical repertoire, from the Baroque era through to the twentieth century. He was an admirer of [[Glenn Gould]]'s interpretations of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], even performing the [[Harpsichord Concerto in D minor, BWV 1052|D minor Keyboard Concerto]] with him on one occasion. The eminent [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] scholar [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] considered Karajan's recordings of the [[London symphonies|12 London Symphonies]] as some of the finest he knew, and his multiple [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] cycles are still staples of many a CD collection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/nov/25/hc-robbins-landon-mozart|title=HC Robbins Landon provided a passport to Mozart's world|last=Service|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Service|date=2009-11-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nYet Karajan's real interests seem to have lain in the period from the late-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Principal among these were his fascinations with the composers [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Jean Sibelius]]. In an interview with ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'''s Robert Layton in 1981, Karajan remarked that he felt \"a much deeper influence, affinity, kinship \u2013 call it what you like \u2013 [in Sibelius's music] with Bruckner. There is this sense of the ''ur-wald'', the primaeval forest, the feeling of elemental power, that one is dealing with something profound.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/karajans-sibelius|title=Karajan's Sibelius|last=Gramophone|date=2015-07-21|website=www.gramophone.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> When pressed about this connection towards the end of his life by biographer Richard Osborne, Karajan echoed some of these same sentiments, commenting: \"There is in both [Bruckner and Sibelius] a sense of the elemental. But I have often asked myself what it is that drew me to Sibelius's music and I think it is that he is a composer who cannot really be compared to anyone else. ... And you ''never'' come to an end with him. I think it is perhaps also to do with my love of remote places, my love of mountains rather than cities.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=107}} Layton demystifies this relationship somewhat by observing that \"[s]tring ''tremolandi'' and pedal points are, of course, among [the similarities between Bruckner and Sibelius' music], and we hear Brucknerian echoes in the development section of the first movement of ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]'', written only a year or so after Sibelius first heard [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Bruckner's Third Symphony]] in [[Vienna]].\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Yet the most potent assessment of Karajan's interpretation of Sibelius's music came from Sibelius himself, who, according to record producer [[Walter Legge]], said that \"Karajan is the only conductor who plays what I meant.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=108}}\n\nKarajan was also a prolific opera conductor, championing the works of both [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], along with the likes of [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. Verdi's last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', was something of a mainstay throughout Karajan's career. In his conversations with Richard Osborne, Karajan recalled that, in the 1930s, when Italian opera was still something of a rarity in Austria and Germany, \"[m]y training in Verdi's ''Falstaff'' came from [[Arturo Toscanini|[Arturo] Toscanini]]. There wasn't a rehearsal in either Vienna or Salzburg at which I wasn't present. I think I heard about thirty. From Toscanini I learnt the phrasing and the words \u2013 always with ''Italian'' singers, which was unheard of in Germany then. I don't think I ever opened the score. It was so in my ears, I just knew it.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|pp=68\u201369}} He went on to make two recordings of it \u2013 one for [[EMI]] in 1956 and another for [[Philips]] in 1980 \u2013 and his production at the Vienna State Opera was hailed by his colleague [[Otto Klemperer]] as \"'really excellent.'\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=68}} Likewise, Richard Strauss was a continual force in Karajan's life, not just as a composer, but as a conductor as well. Karajan regaled their only \u2018proper' meeting, in 1939, to Osborne, stating that \"at the end [of a performance of ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' in Berlin] he [Strauss] came and said to me it was the best performance of the opera he had ever heard. I said, 'I don't really want to hear this; tell me what was wrong with it.' I think he was surprised by my reaction, so he asked me to lunch the next day. He said, 'You have made the music very clear, the ''fp'' here, the accent there; but these are not at all important. Just wave your stick around a bit!' He made a gesture like stirring a pudding. But what he meant was, let the music flow more naturally.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n=== Use of recording technology ===\nKarajan conducted and recorded prolifically, mainly with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic. Although he conducted other orchestras (including the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouw Orchestra]], the [[Orchestre de Paris]], the Orchestra of Teatro alla Scala, Milan and the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]]), the vast majority of his recordings were made with the Berlin and Vienna orchestras with which he was most associated. He also left a considerable legacy of recordings with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], his last performance being in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karajan.co.uk/orchestras.html|title=Herbert Von Karajan \u2013 Orchestras|website=www.karajan.co.uk|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> Although he made recordings with several labels, notably [[EMI Classics|EMI]], it is [[Deutsche Grammophon]] with which he became most associated. He made 330 recordings with the label during his career.\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe so-called \u2018Karajan sound' which so distinguished his style as a conductor remains something of a litmus test for critics, dividing them into two competing camps. Two reviews from the ''[[Penguin Guide to Compact Discs]]'' illustrate this point:\n\n* Concerning a recording of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1971\u201372 studio recording), a canonical Romantic work, the Penguin authors wrote, \"Karajan's is a sensual performance of Wagner's masterpiece, caressingly beautiful and with superbly refined playing from the Berlin Philharmonic\".<ref>''Penguin Guide to Compact Discs''; 2005. Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0141022620}}. p. 1477.</ref>\n* About Karajan's recording of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] [[Paris symphonies|\"Paris\" symphonies]], the same authors wrote, \"big-band Haydn with a vengeance&nbsp;... It goes without saying that the quality of the orchestral playing is superb. However, these are heavy-handed accounts, closer to Imperial Berlin than to Paris&nbsp;... the Minuets are very slow indeed&nbsp;... These performances are too charmless and wanting in grace to be whole-heartedly recommended.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs and Cassettes |url=https://archive.org/details/penguinguidetoco00ivan |url-access=registration |year=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780140513677 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/penguinguidetoco00ivan/page/576 576]}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' writer [[John Rockwell]] wrote in 1989: \"He had a particular gift for Wagner and above all for [<nowiki/>[[Anton Bruckner|Anton]]] Bruckner, whose music he conducted with sovereign command and elevated feeling.\"<ref name=\"NYT obit\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nDuring his life, Karajan's concerts became viewed as major cultural events.

I can only hope there is an advantage to my being known in the world, that through the interest people take in me, they will then move on to an interest in music.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/22/arts/how-von-karajan-sees-his-conducting-success.html|title=How Von Karajan Sees His Conducting Success|last=Holland|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Holland|date=1982-10-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Much of Karajan's legacy is inextricable from his pioneering attitude towards recording technology. He created over 800 recordings during his career, far surpassing the output of other contemporary conductors. [[Deutsche Grammophon]], the West German record company that shared him with EMI, said his albums sold <nowiki>''probably hundreds of millions''</nowiki> of copies. [[Der Spiegel]], the West German newsweekly, reported that he earned more than $6 million annually from record sales and conducting fees.<ref name=\"NYT obit\" />\n\n=== Notable students ===\nDespite Karajan's significant prowess as a conductor, he was more often seen behind the camera than in the teaching studio, preferring to record rehearsals rather than give masterclasses.

Performances of works written post-1950 included [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich's]] [[Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth Symphony]], written in 1953, which he performed many times and recorded twice. He and Shostakovich met during a tour with the Berlin Philharmonic culminating in Moscow in May 1969<ref>[http://www.karajan.co.uk/hvkforum/John%20-%20Karajan%20books%20004.jpg Shostakovich and Karajan photo]. karajan.co.uk</ref> and Karajan had stated in an interview with the German TV-channel [[ZDF]] in 1983 that if he had been a composer instead of conductor, his music would have sounded similar to Shostakovich's. Despite those sentiments, Karajan's Shostakovich performances and recordings were restricted to the Tenth Symphony only. Karajan conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''Sonata per Archi'' (1958) and ''Antifone'' (1960), the only Henze works he ever performed. In 1960 he performed [[Ildebrando Pizzetti]]'s opera ''[[Assassinio nella cattedrale]]'' written two years before. Karajan premiered [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[De temporum fine comoedia]]'' in 1973 with the [[Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and recorded the work for [[Deutsche Grammophon]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gottbegnadeten list#Conductors|''Gottbegnadeten'' list]]\n* [[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Herbert von Karajan recording)|Debussy: ''Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande'' (Herbert von Karajan recording)]]\n* [[Le nozze di Figaro (Herbert von Karajan April 1978 recording)|Mozart: ''Le nozze di Figaro'' (Herbert von Karajan recording)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Cite book|title=Conversations with von Karajan|last=von Karajan|first=Herbert|year=1989|publisher=Harper & Row|editor-last=Osborne|editor-first=Richard|isbn=0060391073|edition=1st US|location=New York|oclc=21042949|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00kara}}\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last=Osborne | first=Richard | title=Herbert von Karajan: A Life in Music | location=Boston | publisher=Northeastern University Press | year=2000 | isbn=1-55553-425-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/herbertvonkaraja00rich }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mischa Aster, \"Das Reichsorchester\", ''Die Berliner Philharmoniker und der Nationalsozialismus.''

After Schulmann was forced to leave Germany in 1933 with the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] take-over, Karajan was promoted to first ''Kapellmeister''. \n\n====The Nazi Years====\n\nIn the postwar era Karajan maintained a silence about his Nazi Party membership which gave rise to a number of conflicting stories regarding it.  One version asserts that because of the changing political climate and the destabilization of his position, Karajan attempted to join the Nazi Party in Salzburg in April 1933, though his membership was later declared invalid for he somehow failed to follow up the application<ref name=\"Osborne 2000\" /> and that Karajan formally joined the Nazi Party in Aachen in 1935, implying that he was not eager to pursue membership.  More recent scholarship clears up this confusion: \"[t]he truth is that Karajan actually joined the Nazi Party twice. The first time this happened was on 8 April 1933 in Salzburg. He paid the admission fee, received the membership number 1607525 and moved to Ulm. It is said that this accession was never formally carried out. It is also certain that Karajan rejoined the Nazi Party in Aachen in March 1935, this time receiving the membership number 3430914. After the annexation of Austria, the responsible Reich Treasurer of the Nazi Party discovered Karajan's double membership in Munich and declared the first accession invalid. The second was made retroactive to 1 May 1933.\"<ref name=zweimal>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article1595506/Der-Mann-der-zweimal-in-die-NSDAP-eintrat.html|title=Der Mann, der zweimal in die NSDAP eintrat|trans-title=The Man Who Joined the NSDAP Twice|last=Kammholz|first=Karsten|date=26 January 2008|work=[[Die Welt]]|access-date=27 March 2020|quote=Zu Lebzeiten wollte sich der Stardirigent nie der Tatsache stellen, Mitglied der NSDAP gewesen zu sein.

She was the daughter of a well-known manufacturer of yarn for sewing machines. Having had a Jewish grandfather, she was considered a ''Viertelj\u00fcdin'' (one-quarter Jewish woman). They divorced in 1958.\n\nOn 6 October 1958, Karajan remarried. His third wife was {{ill|Eliette von Karajan|de|lt=Eliette Mouret}}, a French model born in [[Mollans-sur-Ouv\u00e8ze]]. She enjoyed a carefree childhood growing up in Provence before being discovered by [[Christian Dior]] when she was just 19 years old. This laid the foundation for an international modelling career. Karajan had first met Eliette Mouret in 1957. Since they met, Karajan had been deeply taken by her. Their first daughter, [[Isabel Karajan|Isabel]], was born on 25 June 1960. In 1964, their second daughter Arabel was born.\n\nAfter the death of Herbert von Karajan in July 1989, Eliette von Karajan continued her husband's musical legacy. With the founding of the Herbert von Karajan Centre in [[Vienna]], now situated in [[Salzburg]] and known as the Eliette and Herbert von Karajan Institute, she created a cultural memorial dedicated to Herbert von Karajan that has established itself during the years of its existence as an essential part of the local cultural scene.

He was also a great sailing and car enthusiast, in particular an amateur of Porsche. He commissioned a unique and tailored model in 1975, a 911 Turbo which still carries his name to this day.\n\nKarajan put the same meticulous attention to detail that made him a master of ''Nibelungen'' productions into the design of his cars. When he contacted the [[Porsche]] special order department in 1974 about a new [[Porsche 930|Type 930]], he made it absolutely clear that he wanted a lighter and more sports-oriented version of the standard production vehicle. Karajan dictated that the car should weigh less than one thousand kilograms and its power-to-weight ratio should be well under four kilos per hp\u2014no easy task, given that the standard version was already at 1,140 kilos and 260 hp. The Porsche CEO at the time, [[Ernst Fuhrmann]], carried out the special wishes of his prominent customer himself. Karajan's Turbo was given the racing chassis of an RSR and the body of a Carrera RS, along with a racing suspension and rollover bars. The interior was rigorously stripped down. The backseat was replaced by a steel roll cage, while the radio and any symphonies it might have played gave way to the harmonies of the flat-six engine, which could mobilize around 100 more hp thanks to a larger turbocharger and a sharper camshaft. Lightweight construction even extended to replacing the door handles with slim leather straps that opened the catch when pulled. And Porsche specifically requested permission from [[Martini & Rossi|Rossi]], the vermouth producer, to replicate the Martini racing paint job from the 911 Carrera RSR Turbo 2.1 that finished second in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Siep |first1=Lena |title=Karajan's unique Porsche |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/christophorus/issue-382/porsche-911-turbo-rs-maestro-herbert-von-karajan-salzburg-13945.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |accessdate=2019-09-30 |date=25 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt sea, Karajan won several regattas aboard his racing yachts baptised ''Helisara''.\n\n== Musicianship ==\nOne of Karajan's signature skills as a conductor was his ability to extract exquisite sounds from orchestras. His biographer Roger Vaughan observed this phenomenon while listening to the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] play in 1986, after nearly 30 years under Karajan's direction, noting that \"what rivets one's attention is the beauty and perfection of the sounds. The softest of pianissimos commands rapt attention. The smooth crescendos peak exactly when they should. The breaks are sliced clean, without the slightest ragged edge.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Herbert von Karajan : a biographical portrait |last=Vaughan |first=Roger |date=1985 |publisher=W.W.

This was, and is, highly unusual for a conductor to do on anything but occasion, as eye-contact is generally regarded as of paramount importance to the conductor's communication with the orchestra's players. Yet, as Vaughan wryly remarks, \"[h]ere is one of the fascinating aspects of conducting: there are no rules, only guidelines. The most eccentric approach is tolerated if the results are successful.\"<ref name=\"Includes index\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/herbertvonkaraja00roge/page/19|title=Herbert von Karajan : a biographical portrait|last=Vaughan|first=Roger|date=1985|publisher=W.W.

Indeed, [[James Galway]], who served as principal flutist of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] from 1969 to 1975, recalled that \"he [Karajan] achieved most of what wanted through charm.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/herbertvonkaraja00roge/page/22|title=Herbert von Karajan : a biographical portrait|last=Vaughan|first=Roger|date=1985|publisher=W.W.

Conducting with his eyes closed, for instance, was viewed as a necessary consequence of memorizing scores, as with that out of the way, there was nothing else to look out.<ref name=\"Includes index\" /> Karajan's method of score study, too, was somewhat unusual, as was noted by his friend [[Walter Legge]], who remarked that \"He [Karajan] is one of the few conductors I have known who has never made a mark in a score. He will absorb a score quietly sitting on the floor, like a relaxed Siamese cat. Over the years he has learned how completely to relax the body so the mind is absolutely free to do what it wants.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=95}} Karajan was also known to have a preternaturally keen sense of tempo, even going so far as to have himself tested against a computer to prove it. He insisted that this skill was learned, not inherited, and considered it the bedrock of musical interpretations. In fact, he cited inconsistencies in rhythmic accuracy and control as \"one thing that might make me lose my temper. I can accept a wrong note from an orchestra but when everything is getting faster or slower, that I cannot accept.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=96}}\n\nHe once explained to a German journalist why he preferred the Berlin to the Vienna Philharmonic. \"If I tell the Berliners to step forward, they do it.  If I tell the Viennese to step forward, they do it. But then they ask why.\"<ref>Norman Lebrecht, The Book of Musical Anecdotes, the Free Press, New York, 1985 p. 326</ref>\n\n=== Musical tastes ===\nKarajan was a noted interpreter of virtually every standard of the classical repertoire, from the Baroque era through to the twentieth century. He was an admirer of [[Glenn Gould]]'s interpretations of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], even performing the [[Harpsichord Concerto in D minor, BWV 1052|D minor Keyboard Concerto]] with him on one occasion. The eminent [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] scholar [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] considered Karajan's recordings of the [[London symphonies|12 London Symphonies]] as some of the finest he knew, and his multiple [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] cycles are still staples of many a CD collection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/nov/25/hc-robbins-landon-mozart|title=HC Robbins Landon provided a passport to Mozart's world|last=Service|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Service|date=2009-11-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nYet Karajan's real interests seem to have lain in the period from the late-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Principal among these were his fascinations with the composers [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Jean Sibelius]]. In an interview with ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'''s Robert Layton in 1981, Karajan remarked that he felt \"a much deeper influence, affinity, kinship \u2013 call it what you like \u2013 [in Sibelius's music] with Bruckner. There is this sense of the ''ur-wald'', the primaeval forest, the feeling of elemental power, that one is dealing with something profound.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/karajans-sibelius|title=Karajan's Sibelius|last=Gramophone|date=2015-07-21|website=www.gramophone.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> When pressed about this connection towards the end of his life by biographer Richard Osborne, Karajan echoed some of these same sentiments, commenting: \"There is in both [Bruckner and Sibelius] a sense of the elemental. But I have often asked myself what it is that drew me to Sibelius's music and I think it is that he is a composer who cannot really be compared to anyone else. ... And you ''never'' come to an end with him. I think it is perhaps also to do with my love of remote places, my love of mountains rather than cities.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=107}} Layton demystifies this relationship somewhat by observing that \"[s]tring ''tremolandi'' and pedal points are, of course, among [the similarities between Bruckner and Sibelius' music], and we hear Brucknerian echoes in the development section of the first movement of ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]'', written only a year or so after Sibelius first heard [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Bruckner's Third Symphony]] in [[Vienna]].\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Yet the most potent assessment of Karajan's interpretation of Sibelius's music came from Sibelius himself, who, according to record producer [[Walter Legge]], said that \"Karajan is the only conductor who plays what I meant.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=108}}\n\nKarajan was also a prolific opera conductor, championing the works of both [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], along with the likes of [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. Verdi's last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', was something of a mainstay throughout Karajan's career. In his conversations with Richard Osborne, Karajan recalled that, in the 1930s, when Italian opera was still something of a rarity in Austria and Germany, \"[m]y training in Verdi's ''Falstaff'' came from [[Arturo Toscanini|[Arturo] Toscanini]]. There wasn't a rehearsal in either Vienna or Salzburg at which I wasn't present. I think I heard about thirty. From Toscanini I learnt the phrasing and the words \u2013 always with ''Italian'' singers, which was unheard of in Germany then. I don't think I ever opened the score. It was so in my ears, I just knew it.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|pp=68\u201369}} He went on to make two recordings of it \u2013 one for [[EMI]] in 1956 and another for [[Philips]] in 1980 \u2013 and his production at the Vienna State Opera was hailed by his colleague [[Otto Klemperer]] as \"'really excellent.'\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|p=68}} Likewise, Richard Strauss was a continual force in Karajan's life, not just as a composer, but as a conductor as well. Karajan regaled their only \u2018proper' meeting, in 1939, to Osborne, stating that \"at the end [of a performance of ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' in Berlin] he [Strauss] came and said to me it was the best performance of the opera he had ever heard. I said, 'I don't really want to hear this; tell me what was wrong with it.' I think he was surprised by my reaction, so he asked me to lunch the next day. He said, 'You have made the music very clear, the ''fp'' here, the accent there; but these are not at all important. Just wave your stick around a bit!' He made a gesture like stirring a pudding. But what he meant was, let the music flow more naturally.\"{{sfn|von Karajan|1989|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n=== Use of recording technology ===\nKarajan conducted and recorded prolifically, mainly with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic. Although he conducted other orchestras (including the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouw Orchestra]], the [[Orchestre de Paris]], the Orchestra of Teatro alla Scala, Milan and the [[Staatskapelle Dresden]]), the vast majority of his recordings were made with the Berlin and Vienna orchestras with which he was most associated. He also left a considerable legacy of recordings with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], his last performance being in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karajan.co.uk/orchestras.html|title=Herbert Von Karajan \u2013 Orchestras|website=www.karajan.co.uk|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> Although he made recordings with several labels, notably [[EMI Classics|EMI]], it is [[Deutsche Grammophon]] with which he became most associated. He made 330 recordings with the label during his career.\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe so-called \u2018Karajan sound' which so distinguished his style as a conductor remains something of a litmus test for critics, dividing them into two competing camps. Two reviews from the ''[[Penguin Guide to Compact Discs]]'' illustrate this point:\n\n* Concerning a recording of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1971\u201372 studio recording), a canonical Romantic work, the Penguin authors wrote, \"Karajan's is a sensual performance of Wagner's masterpiece, caressingly beautiful and with superbly refined playing from the Berlin Philharmonic\".<ref>''Penguin Guide to Compact Discs''; 2005. Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0141022620}}. p. 1477.</ref>\n* About Karajan's recording of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] [[Paris symphonies|\"Paris\" symphonies]], the same authors wrote, \"big-band Haydn with a vengeance&nbsp;... It goes without saying that the quality of the orchestral playing is superb. However, these are heavy-handed accounts, closer to Imperial Berlin than to Paris&nbsp;... the Minuets are very slow indeed&nbsp;... These performances are too charmless and wanting in grace to be whole-heartedly recommended.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs and Cassettes |url=https://archive.org/details/penguinguidetoco00ivan |url-access=registration |year=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780140513677 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/penguinguidetoco00ivan/page/576 576]}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' writer [[John Rockwell]] wrote in 1989: \"He had a particular gift for Wagner and above all for [<nowiki/>[[Anton Bruckner|Anton]]] Bruckner, whose music he conducted with sovereign command and elevated feeling.\"<ref name=\"NYT obit\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nDuring his life, Karajan's concerts became viewed as major cultural events.

I can only hope there is an advantage to my being known in the world, that through the interest people take in me, they will then move on to an interest in music.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/22/arts/how-von-karajan-sees-his-conducting-success.html|title=How Von Karajan Sees His Conducting Success|last=Holland|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Holland|date=1982-10-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Much of Karajan's legacy is inextricable from his pioneering attitude towards recording technology. He created over 800 recordings during his career, far surpassing the output of other contemporary conductors. [[Deutsche Grammophon]], the West German record company that shared him with EMI, said his albums sold <nowiki>''probably hundreds of millions''</nowiki> of copies. [[Der Spiegel]], the West German newsweekly, reported that he earned more than $6 million annually from record sales and conducting fees.<ref name=\"NYT obit\" />\n\n=== Notable students ===\nDespite Karajan's significant prowess as a conductor, he was more often seen behind the camera than in the teaching studio, preferring to record rehearsals rather than give masterclasses. He maintained a long friendship with [[Seiji Ozawa]] whose success makes him Karajan's most reputable student.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/15/arts/2-maestros-pupil-and-sensei-in-japan.html|title=2 Maestros, Pupil and Sensei, in Japan|last=Scott-Stokes|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Scott-Stokes|date=1981-11-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Indeed, Ozawa was reportedly a strong contender to succeed Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic; Karajan specifically mentioned him as a \"conductor with the best character\" for the position.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/arts/after-karajan-a-cloudy-crystal-ball.html|title=After Karajan, a Cloudy Crystal Ball|agency=AP|date=1987-07-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Awards and honours ===\nKarajan was the recipient of multiple honours and awards.

Performances of works written post-1950 included [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich's]] [[Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth Symphony]], written in 1953, which he performed many times and recorded twice. He and Shostakovich met during a tour with the Berlin Philharmonic culminating in Moscow in May 1969<ref>[http://www.karajan.co.uk/hvkforum/John%20-%20Karajan%20books%20004.jpg Shostakovich and Karajan photo]. karajan.co.uk</ref> and Karajan had stated in an interview with the German TV-channel [[ZDF]] in 1983 that if he had been a composer instead of conductor, his music would have sounded similar to Shostakovich's. Despite those sentiments, Karajan's Shostakovich performances and recordings were restricted to the Tenth Symphony only. Karajan conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''Sonata per Archi'' (1958) and ''Antifone'' (1960), the only Henze works he ever performed. In 1960 he performed [[Ildebrando Pizzetti]]'s opera ''[[Assassinio nella cattedrale]]'' written two years before. Karajan premiered [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[De temporum fine comoedia]]'' in 1973 with the [[Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and recorded the work for [[Deutsche Grammophon]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gottbegnadeten list#Conductors|''Gottbegnadeten'' list]]\n* [[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Herbert von Karajan recording)|Debussy: ''Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande'' (Herbert von Karajan recording)]]\n* [[Le nozze di Figaro (Herbert von Karajan April 1978 recording)|Mozart: ''Le nozze di Figaro'' (Herbert von Karajan recording)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Cite book|title=Conversations with von Karajan|last=von Karajan|first=Herbert|year=1989|publisher=Harper & Row|editor-last=Osborne|editor-first=Richard|isbn=0060391073|edition=1st US|location=New York|oclc=21042949|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00kara}}\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last=Osborne | first=Richard | title=Herbert von Karajan: A Life in Music | location=Boston | publisher=Northeastern University Press | year=2000 | isbn=1-55553-425-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/herbertvonkaraja00rich }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mischa Aster, \"Das Reichsorchester\", ''Die Berliner Philharmoniker und der Nationalsozialismus.''

Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in [[Atlanta]].<ref>(1996) Album notes for ''No Code'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet]. New York: Sony Music.</ref>\n\nThe sessions for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist [[Jeff Ament]] wasn't made aware that the band was recording until three days into the sessions, and said that he \"wasn't super involved with that record on any level.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\".

We'd all just get pissed off at each other.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions,<ref name=\"Garbarini\">Garbarini, Vic. \"All For One: Pearl Jam Yield to the Notion That United They Stand and Divided They Fall\".

''ACE Weekly''. 2003.</ref> Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was \"more on-the-fly during the making of ''No Code'', and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\">Peiken, Matt. \"Jack Irons: This Inner Life\". ''[[Modern Drummer]]''. June 1998.</ref>\n\nMcCready said that a lot of the songs were developed out of [[jam session]]s, and said \"I think we kind of rushed it a little bit.\"<ref>Engleheart, Murray. \"Interview with Mike McCready\". ''Massive!''. February/March 1998.</ref> Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals.<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> He added that \"Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of ''No Code'', he was so burnt, it was so much work for him.\"<ref name=\"philadelphia\">Moon, Tom. \"Calling Off the Crusades\". ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. February 8, 1998.</ref> The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that \"everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him \"a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.\"<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> Vedder said, \"Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

The song is heavily influenced by [[garage rock]].\n}}\nWhile ''Vitalogy'' had shifted away from the earlier albums' accessible compositions and polished production, ''No Code'' represented a deliberate break from ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'''s [[Arena rock|stadium]] sound, favoring [[Experimental rock|experimental]] ballads and noisy [[garage rock]] songs. It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (\"[[Off He Goes]]\"), [[Music of Asia|Eastern]] influences (\"[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]\"), and [[spoken word]] (\"I'm Open\"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs \"Who You Are\" and \"In My Tree\". Irons stated, \"To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\"/> Vedder said, \"We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment.\"<ref name=\"spin\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that \"''No Code'' displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\"<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\".
