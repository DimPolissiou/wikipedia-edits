Extending the {{convert|7000|feet|m}} foot runway was not possible due to space limitations surrounding the urban airport, and construction on [[Kansas City International Airport]] north of the city was approved the next year, opening in 1972 with runways {{convert|9500|feet|m}} and {{convert|9000|feet|m}} in length.\n\n===Engineered materials arrestor system===\nAirports such as [[LaGuardia Airport]] in [[Queens, New York]] may lack adequate space to meet runway safety area standards. As a result, in the 1990s, the FAA began conducting research on new technology to rapidly stop aircraft in less than {{convert|1000|feet|m}} in the event of a runway overrun.<ref name=\"Fortune 2020.02.06\">{{cite magazine |url=https://fortune.com/2016/10/28/mike-pence-plane/ |title=How These Special Blocks Likely Saved Mike Pence\u2019s Plane From Disaster |magazine=Fortune |date=October 28, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[engineered materials arrestor system]] (EMAS) was developed as a high energy absorbing material that could be installed as a surface beyond the end of runways, which was designed to collapse under the weight of an aircraft (absorbing energy and slowing the plane in the process) in the event of an overrun.

Walgreen]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.walgreens.com/topic/about/companyhistory.jsp|title= Our History|publisher= Walgreens\n|accessdate= March 6, 2008}}</ref> By 1913, Walgreens had grown to four stores on [[Chicago's South Side]]. It opened its fifth in 1915 and four more in 1916. By 1919, there were 20 stores in the chain. As a result of [[Prohibition in the United States|alcohol prohibition]], the 1920s were a successful time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.<ref>{{cite news|title=When Cannabis Meets Capitalism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27pot.html|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 the company introduced a [[malt]]ed [[milkshake]], which led to its establishing ice cream manufacturing plants. The next year, Walgreen began opening stores away from residential areas. In the mid 1920s, there were 44 stores with annual sales of $1,200,000 combined. Walgreens had also expanded by then into [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], and [[Wisconsin]].\n\nBy 1930 it had 397 stores with annual sales of [[US$]]4,000,000. This expansion partly was attributed to selling prescribed alcohol, mainly whiskey, which Walgreen often stocked under the counter, as accounted in Daniel Okrent's ''Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition''.<ref>Daniel Okrent, Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (197)</ref> The stock market crash in October 1929 and the subsequent [[Great Depression]] did not greatly affect the company. By 1934, Walgreens was operating in 30 states with 601 stores.\n\nAfter Charles Walgreen Sr. died in 1939, his son [[Charles Rudolph Walgreen Jr.|Charles R. Walgreen Jr.]] took over the chain until his retirement. The Charles R. Walgreen (Walgreen Jr.) years were relatively prosperous, but lacked the massive expansion seen in the early part of the century. Charles \"Cork\" R. Walgreen III took over after Walgreen Jr.'s retirement in the early 1950s and modernized the company by switching to [[barcode]] scanning. The Walgreen family was not involved in senior management of the company for a short time following Walgreen III's retirement.\n\nIn 1986, it acquired the MediMart chain from Stop & Shop.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3007/is_15_25/ai_n29055026/ | work=Chain Drug Review | title=Walgreens buys Medi Mart | year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Kevin P.

The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. In contrast, in 2011 the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011, this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Florida, a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is \"an imminent danger to the public safety.\" All DEA licensees \"have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting into the hands of legitimate patients,\" said Mark Trouville, former DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. \"When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper.\"\n\nThe Jupiter, Florida, distribution center, which opened in 2001, is one of 12 such distribution centers owned by Walgreens. Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter facility has been the largest distributor of oxycodone in the state of Florida, the DEA said. Over the past three years, its market share has increased, and 52 Walgreens are among the top 100 oxycodone purchasers in the state, the DEA said.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012/09/17/walgreens-and-oxycodone/57782912/1 Walgreens and Oxycodone \u2013 USATODAY.com].

It opened its fifth in 1915 and four more in 1916. By 1919, there were 20 stores in the chain. As a result of [[Prohibition in the United States|alcohol prohibition]], the 1920s were a successful time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.<ref>{{cite news|title=When Cannabis Meets Capitalism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27pot.html|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 the company introduced a [[malt]]ed [[milkshake]], which led to its establishing ice cream manufacturing plants. The next year, Walgreen began opening stores away from residential areas. In the mid 1920s, there were 44 stores with annual sales of $1,200,000 combined. Walgreens had also expanded by then into [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], and [[Wisconsin]].\n\nBy 1930 it had 397 stores with annual sales of [[US$]]4,000,000. This expansion partly was attributed to selling prescribed alcohol, mainly whiskey, which Walgreen often stocked under the counter, as accounted in Daniel Okrent's ''Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition''.<ref>Daniel Okrent, Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (197)</ref> The stock market crash in October 1929 and the subsequent [[Great Depression]] did not greatly affect the company.

Walgreen (Walgreen Jr.) years were relatively prosperous, but lacked the massive expansion seen in the early part of the century. Charles \"Cork\" R.

The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. In contrast, in 2011 the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011, this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Florida, a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is \"an imminent danger to the public safety.\" All DEA licensees \"have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting into the hands of legitimate patients,\" said Mark Trouville, former DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. \"When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper.\"\n\nThe Jupiter, Florida, distribution center, which opened in 2001, is one of 12 such distribution centers owned by Walgreens. Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter facility has been the largest distributor of oxycodone in the state of Florida, the DEA said.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\".

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''.

In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\". The album contains 14 tracks, all of which were written/co-written by Seely herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/new-country-americana-alt-country-bluegrass-folk-albums-2017/#photogallery-1=4|title=New Country, Americana, Alt-Country, Bluegrass and Folk Albums Coming in 2017|website=The Boot|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref> ''Written in Song'' was chosen as one of the most anticipated albums of 2017 by both [[CMT.com]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1775143/11-new-albums-coming-in-the-new-year/|title=11 New Albums Coming in the New Year|publisher=Country Music Television|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref> and [[The Boot (website)|The Boot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/new-albums-january-2017/|title=Vote for the Most Anticipated Album of January 2017|website=The Boot|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeely celebrated her 50th anniversary as a member of the Grand Ole Opry on September 16, 2017<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/09/15/jeannie-seely-grand-ole-opry-elizabeth-cook/659744001/|title=Jeannie Seely celebrates 50 years as Opry member|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref> and is one of only four living women (the others being [[Dolly Parton]], [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Connie Smith]]) to have reached this milestone.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Jeannie Seely among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jeannie Seely discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Award program''' || '''Award''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Billboard magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Record World|Record World magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1967 || [[Grammy Awards]] || ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\" || Won\n|-\n| 1972 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with [[Jack Greene]]) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1973 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1974 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1975 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 2017 || R.O.P.E || ''Entertainer of the Year'' (with [[Gene Watson]]) || Won\n|}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Oermann |first1=Robert K. |last2=Bufwack |first2=Mary A. |title=Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music: 1800\u20132000 |date=2003 |publisher=The Country Music Press & Vanderbilt University Press |location=Nashville, TN |isbn=0-8265-1432-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/findinghervoicew0000bufw|ref={{SfnRef|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003}} }}\n* {{cite web |author1=Seely, Jeannie |author2= Harman, Ron|year=2002|url=http://jeannieseely.com/docs/Jeannie%20Seely%20Full%20Length%20Bio.pdf|title=Biography|work=Jeannie Seely.com|accessdate=April 10, 2020|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Trott |first1=Walt |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-517608-7|ref={{SfnRef|Trott, Walt|2012}} }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.jeannieseely.com/}}\n* [http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/seely_jeannie/artist.jhtml Jeannie Seely at CMT.com]\n\n{{Jeannie Seely}}\n{{Grand Ole Opry}}\n{{Grand Ole Opry members}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seely, Jeannie}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American female country singers]]\n[[Category:American record producers]]\n[[Category:Challenge Records artists]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Decca Records artists]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Grand Ole Opry members]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Monument Records artists]]\n[[Category:People from Titusville, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "ChrisTofu11961", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1966\u20131975: \"Don't Touch Me\" and breakthrough:fixed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Seely"}
