Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist.

[[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\" />\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Apicius 1709.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|''[[Apicius]]'', ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' (\"On the Subject of Cooking\"), 1709 edition.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than [[French cuisine]]. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency.<ref>Capatti, 158\u2013159.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]]. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a \"Treatise on the Potato\" after the French [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]]'s successful promotion of the tuber.<ref>De Conte, 17</ref> In 1790, [[Francesco Leonardi (Chef)|Francesco Leonardi]] in his book ''L'Apicio moderno'' (\"Modern [[Apicius]]\") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato-based sauce.<ref>Faccioli, 753</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]], wrote ''A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie'' with recipes \"suitable for a modest household\". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as ''Genoese Cappon Magro''. In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.<ref>De Conte, 18\u201319</ref>\n\n''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (''The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well''), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes predominantly originate from [[Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]], where he lived.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:BasilkumPesto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pesto]], a Ligurian sauce made out of basil, olive oil and pine nuts, and which can be eaten with pasta or other dishes such as soup.]]\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or [[baccal\u00e0]]), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | authorlink=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Manuali | last2=Tania | title=Lidia Cooks from the Heart of Italy: A Feast of 175 Regional Recipes | edition=1st}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | authorlink=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Mariani | last2=John | title=How Italian Food Conquered the World | edition=1st}}</ref> Italians like their ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/16/ten-commandments-of-italian-cooking|title=Ten commandments of Italian cooking|last=Conte|first=Anna Del|date=16 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Northern Italy]] though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/regionalcuisines1/ss/northeastern.htm|title=Northern Regional Cuisines|author=Kyle Phillips|work=About}}</ref> Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes. Basil (found in [[pesto]]), nuts, and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham ([[prosciutto]]), sausage ([[cotechino Modena|cotechino]]), different sorts of [[salami]], truffles, [[Grana (cheese)|grana]], [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]], and [[tomato]]es ([[Bolognese sauce]] or [[rag\u00f9]]).\n[[File:Italian olive oil 2007.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.35|[[Olive oil]] is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Italian cooking, and as the basis for sauces, often replaces animal fats of butter or lard.<ref name=\"May2005\">{{cite book|last=May|first=Tony|title=Italian Cuisine: The New Essential Reference to the Riches of the Italian Table|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tAafwz2YcQC&pg=PA7|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-30280-1|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>]]\n\nTraditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

The [[S\u00fcdtirol]] cuisine has strong [[Alps|alpine]] regional and [[Austria]]n influence]]\nBefore the [[Council of Trent]] in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] came in.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\">Piras, 67.</ref>\n\nThe [[Trentino]] subregion produces various types of sausages, polenta, yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake, and freshwater fish. In the [[S\u00fcdtirol]] (Alto Adige) subregion, due to the German-speaking majority population, strong Austrian and Slavic influences prevail. The most renowned local product is traditional ''[[speck]]'' juniper-flavored ham which, as [[Speck Alto Adige PGI|Speck Alto Adige]], is regulated by the [[European Union]] under the [[protected geographical indication]] (PGI) status. [[Goulash]], ''[[kn\u00f6del]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[kaiserschmarrn]]'', ''[[krapfen]]'', ''[[r\u00f6sti]]'', ''[[sp\u00e4tzle]]'', and [[rye bread]] are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade [[sauerkraut]], and lard.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\" /> The territory of [[Bolzano]] is also reputed for its [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] white wines.\n\n=== Tuscany ===\n[[File:Finocchiona from Tuscany.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Finocchiona]]'', a classic southern Tuscan Salami]]\n\nSimplicity is central to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes. Regional desserts include ''[[panforte]]'' (prepared with honey, fruits, and nuts), ''[[ricciarelli]]'' (biscuits made using an almond base with sugar, honey, and egg white), and ''[[cavallucci]]'' (cookies made with almonds, candied fruits, coriander, flour, and honey).

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

The ''primo'' (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

Although the country known as Italy [[Italian unification|did not unite until the 19th century]], the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook ([[Apicius]]) which dates back to first century BC.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Italian Food|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/history-of-italian-food-cuisine.html|website=yourguidetoitaly.com}}</ref> Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the [[New World]] have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Roman Empire]], when different cities [[Italian city-states|began to separate]] and form their own traditions. Many different types of [[bread]] and [[pasta]] were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, [[Milan]] (north of Italy) is known for its [[risotto]]s, [[Bologna]] (the central/middle of the country) is known for its [[tortellini]] and [[Naples]] (the south) is famous for its [[pizza]]s<ref>[http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/showassoc_eng.php?id=140 First pizzeria was settled in Naples]</ref> and [[spaghetti]]s.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{See also|Ancient Roman cuisine|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe first known Italian [[food writer]] was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] named [[Archestratus]] from [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]] in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s or other [[seasonings]]. He placed importance on simple preparation of [[fish]].<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\">Del Conte, 11.</ref>\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and [[Food and dining in the Roman Empire|replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed]]. By the time ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published in the 1st century AD, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce [[bread]]s and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best [[cheesemaker]]s. The Romans reared [[goat]]s for [[butcher]]ing, and grew [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 11\" />\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine}}\n[[File:Fortezza Verrucole Archeopark interno.jpg|thumb|left|A restored medieval kitchen inside [[Verrucole Castle]], Tuscany.]]\nWith culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], a cuisine developed in [[Sicily]] that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Arab]]s invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing [[spinach]], [[almond]]s, and [[rice]].<ref name=\"Harmon\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/garden/arab-sicilian-food-tale-of-1001-years.html|title=Arab-Sicilian Food: Tale of 1,001 Years|last=Jenkins|first=Nancy Harmon|date=18 October 1989|work=The New York Times|access-date=3 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 12th century, a [[Normans|Norman]] king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from [[flour]] and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'', a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/sicily-food-wine/arab-culinary-influence-in-sicilian-food|title=Arab Culinary Influence in Sicilian Food|last=Team|first=Delicious Italy|access-date=3 May 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref> [[Normans]] also introduced the [[casserole]], [[salt cod]] (baccal\u00e0), and [[stockfish]], all of which remain popular.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\">Del Conte, 12.</ref>\n\n[[Food preservation]] was either chemical or physical, as [[refrigeration]] did not exist. Meats and fish were [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]], dried, or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to [[pickling|pickle]] items such as [[herring]], and to cure [[pork]]. [[Root vegetable]]s were preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other means of preservation included [[oil]], [[vinegar]], or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, [[liquor]], honey, and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of [[Germany|Germanic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the south reflects Arab<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> influence, as much [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] was spread by Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2\u20134.</ref> The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]]. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman ''pastello'', Lasagna pie, and call for the use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]].<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saffron]] has been used in Italy for centuries]]\n\nIn the 15th century, [[Maestro Martino]] was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'', made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], displaying [[Iran|Persian]] influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 12\" /> The Roman recipes include ''coppiette'' (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His [[Florence|Florentine]] dishes include eggs with ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'' (sweets), macaroni, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] printed in [[Venice]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[Grayling (genus)|grayling]] from [[Adda (river)|Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and [[Picenum|Piceno]], [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from the [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[ficus|figs]] from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|eels]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. [[Wine]] from the Ligurian coast, [[Greco (grape)|Greco]] from Tuscany and [[Centola|San Severino]], and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and [[Picenum|Piceno]] are also mentioned in the book.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nThe courts of [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], and [[Ferrara]] were central to the cuisine. [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]], steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]], published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scappi.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.6|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]\nIn 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]], wrote his ''Opera'' in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in [[Lent]]. These fish recipes are simple, including [[poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grilling]], and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan [[pizza]] (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as [[maize|corn]] (maize) and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] are included.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\">Del Conte, 14, 15.</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote ''Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit''), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to England because he was a [[Protestant]]. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" /> Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[lemon]] juice, [[verjus]], or [[orange juice]]. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and [[truffles]] in the winter, detailing the use of [[pigs]] in the search for truffles.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 14,15\" />[[File:Arte di ben cucinare.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.6|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]\n\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the [[Duchy of Mantua]], published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the first to offer a section on ''vitto ordinario'' (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke [[Charles III, Duke of Mantua|Charles]] for Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.<ref name=\"Del Conte, 15\">Del Conte, 15.</ref>\n\nOther books from this time, such as ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]], tell how ''scalci'' (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners.

Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref> Periodicals in booklet form such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (''The Cook of Cremona'') in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency.<ref>Capatti, 158\u2013159.</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.<ref>Capatti, 282\u2013284.</ref>\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from [[Macerata]] in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (''The Cook of Macerata''). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and [[pasta]], rice, and [[gnocchi]]. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (''The Courteous Cook'') gave particular emphasis to v''itto pitagorico'' (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n[[File:Tomato2 002.jpg|thumb|Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Gentilcore2010\">{{cite book |last=Gentilcore |first=David |title=Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZgEvOPTQLsC |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date=15 June 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-15206-8|page=x}}</ref>]]\n\n''Zuppa alli pomidoro'' in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan [[pappa al pomodoro]].

In 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured [[Milan]]ese dishes such as kidney with [[anchovies]] and lemon and [[gnocchi]] alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 addressed the cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]].

In [[Tuscany]], pasta (especially [[pappardelle]]) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In [[Southern Italy]], tomatoes&nbsp;(fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), [[Capsicum|peppers]], olives and [[olive oil]], garlic, [[artichoke]]s, oranges, [[ricotta cheese]], [[eggplants]], [[zucchini]], certain types of [[fish]] (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named\u2014[[penne]], [[maccheroni]], [[spaghetti]], [[linguine]], [[fusilli]], [[lasagne]], and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]].\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include [[spaghetti]] (thin rods), [[rigatoni]] (tubes or cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets). Dumplings, like [[gnocchi]] (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like [[sp\u00e4tzle]], are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from [[durum wheat]] flour or durum wheat [[semolina]], and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: ''firm to the bite'', meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as [[pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (''pasta all'uovo'' \"egg pasta\"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\n== Regional variation ==\nEach area [[List of Italian dishes|has its own specialties]], primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.<ref name=HazanIntroduction>{{cite book |last1=Hazan |first1=Marcella|authorlink1=Marcella Hazan|date=27 October 1992|title=Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0394584041 |edition=1st |url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/77517/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking/ |accessdate=2 November 2015|format=Kindle and printed. |chapter=Introduction|quote=...Italian cooking?

Other typical dishes are ''[[pitina]]'' (meatballs made of smoked meats), game, and various types of ''[[gnocchi]]'' and ''[[polenta]]''.\n\nThe majority of the eastern regional dishes are heavily influenced by Austrian, Hungarian, Slovene and Croatian cuisines: typical dishes include [[Istrian Stew]] (soup of beans, sauerkraut, potatoes, bacon, and spare ribs), [[Vienna sausages]], ''[[goulash]]'', ''[[\u0107evapi]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[gugelhupf]]''. Pork can be spicy and is often prepared over an open hearth called a ''fogolar''. [[Collio Goriziano]], [[Friuli Isonzo]], [[Colli Orientali del Friuli]], and [[Ramandolo]] are well-known [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] regional wines.\n\n=== Liguria ===\n[[File:Rosemary Focaccia.jpg|thumb|''[[Focaccia]]'' with rosemary. Focaccia is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine]]\n\n[[Liguria]] is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. [[Umami|Savory]] pies are popular, mixing greens and [[artichoke]]s along with cheeses, milk curds, and eggs. [[Onion]]s and [[olive oil]] are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use [[chickpea]]s in ''[[farinata]]'' and polenta-like ''[[panissa]]''. The former is served plain or topped with onions, [[artichoke]]s, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\">Piras, 167, 177.</ref>\n\nHilly districts use [[chestnut]]s as a source of carbohydrates. Ligurian pastas include ''corzetti'' from the [[Val Polcevera|Polcevera valley]]; ''pansoti'', a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables; ''piccagge'', pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and served with artichoke sauce or ''[[pesto]]'' sauce; ''[[trenette]]'', made from [[whole wheat flour]] cut into long strips and served with pesto; boiled beans and potatoes; and ''trofie'', a Ligurian ''[[gnocchi]]'' made from whole grain flour and boiled potatoes, made into a spiral shape and often tossed in ''pesto''.<ref name=\"Piras, 167, 177\" /> Many Ligurians emigrated to [[Argentina]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing the cuisine of the country (which was otherwise dominated by meat and dairy products that the narrow Ligurian hinterland would have not allowed).\n\n=== Lazio ===\n{{Main|Roman cuisine}}\n[[File:Spaghetti carbonara.jpg|right|thumb|Spaghetti ''[[carbonara|alla carbonara]]'']]\n\nPasta dishes based on the use of ''[[guanciale]]'' (unsmoked bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks) are often found in [[Lazio]], such as pasta [[carbonara|''alla carbonara'']] and pasta ''[[Sugo all'amatriciana|all'amatriciana]]''. Another pasta dish of the region is ''[[arrabbiata]]'', with spicy tomato sauce.

Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as ''[[risotto]]''. The best-known version is ''risotto alla milanese'', flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as ''[[ossobuco]] alla milanese'' (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and ''[[cotoletta]] alla milanese'' (a fried cutlet similar to [[Wiener schnitzel]], but cooked \"bone-in\").<ref name=\"Piras, 87\">Piras, 87.</ref>\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[cassoeula]]'' (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), [[Cremona]]'s [[Mostarda]] (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), [[Valtellina]]'s [[bresaola]] (air-dried salted beef) and [[pizzoccheri]] (a flat ribbon pasta made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes, and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese), and [[Mantua]]'s ''tortelli di zucca'' (''[[ravioli]]'' with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.<ref name=\"Piras, 87\" />\n\nRegional cheeses include [[Robiola]], [[Crescenza]], [[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]], [[Gorgonzola cheese|Gorgonzola]], and [[Grana Padano]] (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle farming). ''[[Polenta]]'' is common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous ''[[panettone]]'' Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked).\n\n=== Marche ===\nOn the coast of [[Marche]], fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and [[ham]]s. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. [[Suckling pig]], [[chicken]], and [[fish]] are often stuffed with [[rosemary]] or [[fennel]] fronds and [[garlic]] before being roasted or placed on the spit.<ref>Piras, 273</ref>\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for ''olive all'ascolana'', (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).<ref name=\"GURI\">[http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/10061dl.htm] Provvedimento 15 febbraio 2006: Iscrizione della denominazione \u00abOliva Ascolana del Piceno\u00bb nel registro delle denominazioni di origine protette e delle indicazioni geografiche protette, ''GURI n. 46''</ref> Another well-known Marche product are the ''[[:it:Maccheroncini di Campofilone|Maccheroncini di Campofilone]]'', from little town of [[Campofilone]], a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth.\n\n=== Piedmont ===\n[[File:Agnolotti.JPG|thumb|left|Traditional Piedmontese ''[[agnolotti]]'']]\n\nBetween the Alps and the [[Po valley]], featuring a large number of different ecosystems, the Piedmont region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. As a point of union between traditional Italian and French cuisine, [[Piedmont]] is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses with [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical status]] and wines under [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]].

Wines from the [[Nebbiolo]] grape such as [[Barolo]] and [[Barbaresco]] are produced as well as wines from the [[Barbera]] grape, fine [[sparkling wine]]s, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, [[Moscato d'Asti]]. The region is also famous for its [[Vermouth]] and [[Ratafia]] production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[Castelmagno (cheese)|Castelmagno]] is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its [[Carr\u00f9]] beef (particularly ''bue grasso'', \"fat ox\"), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon, and salt; [[carpaccio]]; Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef; and boiled beef served with various sauces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are the traditional ''[[agnolotti]]'' (pasta folded over with roast beef and vegetable stuffing), ''paniscia'' (a typical dish of [[Novara]], a kind of [[risotto]] with [[Arborio rice]] or [[Maratelli]] rice, the typical kind of [[Saluggia]] beans, onion, [[Barbera]] wine, lard, salami, season vegetables, salt and pepper), ''[[taglierini]]'' (thinner version of tagliatelle), ''[[bagna cauda]]'' (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil, and butter), and ''[[bicerin]]'' (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate, and whole milk).

The [[S\u00fcdtirol]] cuisine has strong [[Alps|alpine]] regional and [[Austria]]n influence]]\nBefore the [[Council of Trent]] in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] came in.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\">Piras, 67.</ref>\n\nThe [[Trentino]] subregion produces various types of sausages, polenta, yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake, and freshwater fish.

The most renowned local product is traditional ''[[speck]]'' juniper-flavored ham which, as [[Speck Alto Adige PGI|Speck Alto Adige]], is regulated by the [[European Union]] under the [[protected geographical indication]] (PGI) status. [[Goulash]], ''[[kn\u00f6del]]'', [[apple strudel]], ''[[kaiserschmarrn]]'', ''[[krapfen]]'', ''[[r\u00f6sti]]'', ''[[sp\u00e4tzle]]'', and [[rye bread]] are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade [[sauerkraut]], and lard.<ref name=\"Piras, 67\" /> The territory of [[Bolzano]] is also reputed for its [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] white wines.\n\n=== Tuscany ===\n[[File:Finocchiona from Tuscany.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Finocchiona]]'', a classic southern Tuscan Salami]]\n\nSimplicity is central to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh [[fruit]] are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ''[[ribollita]]'', a notable soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. ''Ribollita'' was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover ''[[minestrone]]'' or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, [[Chard|silverbeet]], ''[[cavolo nero]]'' (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as ''[[pici]]'' resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional [[Florentine steak]], come from the [[Chianina]] cattle breed of the [[Chiana Valley]] and the [[Maremmana]] from [[Maremma]].\n\nPork is also produced.<ref>Piras, 221\u2013239.</ref> The region is well-known also for its rich [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[wild boar]], [[European hare|hare]], [[fallow deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[pheasant]] that often are used to prepare ''[[pappardelle]]'' dishes.

Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]], and [[frog legs]] appear farther away from the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nMade from finely ground maize meal, [[polenta]] is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of [[Northern Italy]]. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include [[Boletus edulis|porcini]], [[rapini]], or other vegetables or meats, such as small [[song-bird]]s in the case of the [[Veneto|Venetian]] and [[Lombardy|Lombard]] dish ''polenta e osei'', or [[sausage]]s. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named ''biancoperla'', so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called ''polenta bianca'').\n[[File:Polenta con sopressa e funghi.jpg|thumb|''[[Polenta]]'' served with ''[[sopressa]]'' and mushrooms, a traditional [[peasant food]] of Veneto]]\n\n[[Bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' (beans and pasta) and ''risi e bisi'' ([[rice and peas]]). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as [[Sopressa|Soppressa Vicentina]], garlic salami, [[Piave cheese]], and [[Asiago cheese]]. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] and white asparagus from [[Bassano del Grappa]]. Perhaps the most popular dish of [[Venice]] is ''[[liver and onions|fegato alla veneziana]]'', thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\n[[Squid]] and [[cuttlefish]] are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called ''nero di seppia''.<ref>Piras, 33.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |title=Venice Cuisine \u2013 by food author Howard Hillman |publisher=Hillmanwonders.com |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611081454/http://www.hillmanwonders.com/cuisines/venice_cuisine.htm |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref> Regional desserts include ''[[tiramisu]]'' (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolks]] and ''[[mascarpone]]'', and flavored with liquor and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = history of tiramisu\n |url         = http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |accessdate  = 16 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20120604101928/http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html\n |archivedate = 4 June 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>), ''[[baicoli]]'' (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and [[nougat]].\n\nThe most celebrated Venetian wines include [[Bardolino]], [[Prosecco]], [[Soave (wine)|Soave]], [[Amarone]], and [[Valpolicella]] [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines.\n\n== Meal structure ==\n{{Main|Meal structure in Italy}}\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of ''[[cappuccino]]'' and brioche / croissant / cornetto.]]\nTraditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://toscanaslc.com/blog/guide-to-the-traditional-italian-meal-structure/|title=Guide to the Traditional Italian Meal Structure|date=22 September 2015|work=Cucina Toscana|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures.

Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (''piatto unico'') combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving.\n[[File:Prosecco-gold-arrangement-1.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of sparkling [[Prosecco]], which one would have as an ''aperitivo'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Meal stage\n!Composition\n|-\n|Aperitivo\n|[[ap\u00e9ritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal, may be: [[Campari]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Cinzano]], [[Amaro Lucano|Lucano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz (alcoholic beverage)|Spritz]], [[Vermouth]], [[Negroni]].\n|-\n|Antipasto\n|literally \"before (the) meal\", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread [[appetizer]]s.\n|-\n|Primo\n|\"first course\", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish [[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|sugo]] or [[rag\u00f9]] as a sauce\n|-\n|Secondo\n|\"second course\", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes.

Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern [[espresso machine]], invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to {{convert|90|to|95|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25\u201330 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 [[Fluid ounce|fl oz]], two tablespoons) of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. [[Neapolitan flip coffee pot|''La Napoletana'']] is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The [[Moka pot|''Moka per il caff\u00e8'']] is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>\n\nEspresso is usually served in a [[demitasse]] cup. [[Caff\u00e8 macchiato]] is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; [[caffelatte]] is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf\u00e9 au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and [[caff\u00e8 corretto]] is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as [[grappa]] or [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[bicerin]] is also an Italian coffee, from [[Turin]]. It is a mixture of [[cappuccino]] and traditional [[hot chocolate]], as it consists of a mix of coffee and [[drinking chocolate]], and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Italian wine}}\n[[File:\"15 - ITALY - DOCG and DOC wine mark.jpg|thumb|[[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG and DOC]] labels on two wine bottles]]\n[[File:Fiasco di vino rosso da tavola Monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Tuscan Chianti in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'']]\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref> There are twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]]. To promote this, the Italian government passed the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]] e garantita'' (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.<ref>Koplan, 307\u2013308.</ref>\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise.\n\n==== Beer ====\n{{Main|Beer in Italy}}\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually [[pale lager]]. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are [[Peroni Brewery|Peroni]] and [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]]. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and [[South Tyrol]] (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\n==== Other ====\n[[File:Homemade limoncello.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.3|A bottle of homemade [[Limoncello]]]]\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. [[Limoncello]], a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy ([[Sorrento]], [[Amalfi]] and the [[Gulf of Naples]]) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.luxuryretreats.com/everything-need-know-drinking-limoncello-italy/|title=Drinking Limoncello in Italy|date=8 December 2017|website=Luxury Retreats Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Amaro Averna|Amaro Sicilianos]] are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. [[Mirto (liqueur)|Mirto]], an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in [[Sardinia]] and other regions. Another well-known digestif is [[Amaro Lucano]] from [[Basilicata]].<ref>Piras, 383.</ref>\n\n[[Grappa]] is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the [[Alps]] and of the [[Po Valley]]. The most famous grappas are distilled in [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Veneto]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Trentino]]. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are [[Martini & Rossi|Martini]], [[Vermouth]], and [[Campari]]. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for [[Champagne (wine)|French champagne]] is [[prosecco]], from the Veneto region.<ref name=\"Atkin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/11/foodanddrink1|title=The fizz that's the bizz|last=Atkin|first=Tim, ''The Observer'' |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2008|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name=\"Dane\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10272259.html|title=Pop the Cork on Prosecco|last=Dane|first=Ana, ''TheStreet.com'' |date=3 July 2006 |accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Desserts ==\n{{Main|List of Italian desserts}}\n{{See also|List of Italian dishes#Desserts and pastry|l1=List of Italian dishes\u2014Desserts and pastry}}\n{{See also|Sicilian cuisine#Desserts and sweets|l1=Sicilian cuisine\u2014Desserts and sweets}}\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and [[candy]] belong to the same category of sweets.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 364\u2013365] |url=https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/364 }}</ref> Traditional candies include [[candied fruit]]s, [[torrone]], and [[nut brittle]]s, all of which are still popular in the modern era.

A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, [[boiled egg]]s, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the [[Colomba Pasquale]] (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with [[almond]]s and [[pearl sugar]].\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed with the ''cena di magro'' (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]].\n\n== Abroad ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nDue to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], and [[Somalia]] (except the [[British Somaliland|northern part]], which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\n==== Libya ====\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of [[pasta]] on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\n==== South Africa ====\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of [[Italian South Africans|Italians]]. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in [[South Africa]], especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== France ====\n\nIn France, the [[cuisine of Corsica]] has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the [[Early Middle Ages]] until 1768 first of a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] and then a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the ''[[charcuterie]]''.\n\n==== Great Britain ====\n\n[[Pizza]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[spaghetti bolognese]] and [[lasagne]] with bolognese ''[[rag\u00f9]]'' and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]] are the most popular forms of Italian food in [[British cuisine|British]], notably, [[English cuisine|English]], cuisine.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on [[Slovenian cuisine]]. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the [[Slovenian Littoral]] and part of [[Inner Carniola]]) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous [[Istrian Italians|Italian minority]] live in [[Slovenian Istria]].\n\nDishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] include the ''gubana'' [[nut roll]] of [[Friuli]] (known as ''guban'ca'' or ''potica'' in Slovenia) and the ''[[Istrian Stew|jota]]'' stew.\n\nDishes that come directly from Italian cuisine include [[gnocchi]] and some types of pasta; [[minestrone]] (''mine\u0161tra'' in Slovene); [[frittata]] (''[[fritaja|frtalja]]''); [[Prosciutto]] (''pr\u0161ut''); and [[polenta]].\n\n=== North and Central America ===\n\n==== Canada and the USA ====\n{{Main|Italian-American cuisine}}\n[[File:Supreme pizza.jpg|thumb|An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers]]\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily [[American cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most [[pizza]] eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\n==== Mexico ====\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a [[breaded cutlet|breaded, pan-fried cutlet]] of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Milanesa napolitana con papas fritas rodajas de tomate y or\u00e9gano.jpg|thumb|\"[[Milanesa]] a la napolitana\" with [[French fries]], an Italian-inspired dish based on the original ''cotoletta'' dish from Milan, common in [[South America]]. This dish is called \"parmegiana steak\" in [[Brazil]], though it is not typical from [[Parma]] region in [[Italy]] but was actually invented in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\n==== Argentina ====\nDue to large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration to Argentina]], Italian food and drink is heavily featured in [[Argentine cuisine]]. An example could be ''[[milanesa]]s'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta]] alla milanese from [[Milan]], Italy) or [[breaded cutlet]]s. [[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as ''[[Sorrentino]]s'' and Argentine gnocchi.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the [[Italian Brazilians|huge Italian community]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including [[milanesa]] steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of [[pizza]], different from both [[Neapolitan cuisine|Neapolitan]] and [[Italian-American cuisine|American]] varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical [[botequim]] counter snack.\n\n==== Venezuela ====\nThere is considerable Italian influence in [[Venezuelan cuisine]]. ''Pan chabata'', or Venezuelan ciabatta, ''Pan Siciliano'', Sicilian bread, ''Cannoli siciliani'', Sicilian cannoli, and the drink [[chinotto (Venezuelan soft drink)|chinotto]] are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Italy|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'', an Italian cookbook\n* ''[[Il talismano della felicit\u00e0]]'' by Ada Boni, an Italian cookbook\n* [[Italian food products]]\n* [[List of Italian cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian DOP cheeses]]\n* [[List of Italian dishes]]\n** [[List of Italian soups]]\n* [[List of Italian restaurants]]\n* [[Sammarinese cuisine]]\n* [[Italian meal structure]]\n* [[Italian wine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Capatti, Alberto and Montanari, Massimo.

The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]], who came from [[Peru]] in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunting.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Pedro de Valdivia]], conqueror of Chile]]\nThe conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=B\u00e1rbaros, page 66.

Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valpara\u00edso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nThe first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9 percent [[mestizo]]s, 8.6 percent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chilo\u00e9 Province|Chilo\u00e9]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of whom were whites and 33.5 percent of whom were natives.\n\nThe Diocese of [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chilo\u00e9. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1 percent of whom were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10 percent of whom were indigenous and 3.7 percent of whom were mestizos, blacks and [[mulatto]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/usuarios/cedoc_online/censos/pdf/censo_1813.pdf |title=INE \u2013 Censo de 1813.

A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] \u2013 heir to the deposed king \u2013 was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9 was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda|penetration into Araucan\u00eda]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes region]] joined the country in 1843, while the [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta region]], at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879. The victory of Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] allowed its expansion into new territories.]]\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Global Economy.

However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[Argentina]] that nearly led to war.\n\n===20th century===\n{{see also|Parliamentary Era in Chile|1960 Valdivia earthquake|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chile's ''Almirante Latorre'' [[dreadnought]] in 1921]]\nThe Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nA military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a [[de facto]] dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that have often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30\u201396}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u201352), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\n\nThe [[1964 Chilean presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830\u20131973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Salvador Allende]]]]\n\nIn the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the \"[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party.

The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21\u201315 split in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, contains 67 members of the governing center-left coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara\u00edso, about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago.\n\n[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|[[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] building in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]] that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertaci\u00f3n and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislature in a roughly 50\u201350 split.\n\nChile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]].

There was a resistance between Peruvians and Chileans for a few years because they could not reach an agreement. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n. This was later signed by both of them on 20 October 1883 to keep peace between them.

It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26\u00b0 S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\n[[File:Volcano Osorno and Petrohu\u00e9 waterfalls.JPG|thumbnail|[[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] and the [[Petrohu\u00e9 River]]]]\n[[File:Glaciar y laguna Nef, afluente Baker,.JPG|thumbnail|[[Nef Glacier]] and the Plomo Lake]]\n\nTo the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.\n\nThe [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].\n\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41\u00b0S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47\u00b0S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].\n\nEast of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n[[File:Lago General Carrera - Camino a Capilla de M\u00e1rmol.JPG|thumb|left|[[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera lake]], the largest in the country.]]\n\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow. They commonly extend from the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], flowing in an East to West.\n\nBecause of the [[Atacama desert]], in the Norte Grande there are only short [[endorheic]] character streams, except for the [[Loa River]], the longest in the country 440&nbsp;km.<ref name=hydr>{{cite journal |author1=Niemeyer, Hans |author2=Cereceda, Pilar |year=1983 |title=Hydrography |journal=Geography of Chile |publisher=[[Military Geographic Institute (Chile)|Military Geographic Institute]] |edition=1st |location=Santiago |volume=8 }}</ref> In the high valleys, wetland areas generate [[Chungar\u00e1 Lake]], located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the [[Lauca River]] are shared with [[Bolivia]], as well as the [[Lluta River]].\n\nIn the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> long, 142&nbsp;km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110&nbsp;km, and Maule with 240&nbsp;km. Their waters mainly flow from Andean snowmelt in the summer and winter rains. The major lakes in this area are the artificial lake Rapel, the Colbun Maule lagoon and the lagoon of La Laja.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Chile-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Population of Chile from 1820, projected up to 2050]]\n{{Main|Demographics of Chile}}\n\nChile's 2017 census reported a population of 17,574,003.

Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as [[mad cow disease]], [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] and [[Phylloxera]]. This, its location in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which has quite different harvesting times from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages.

The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]], who came from [[Peru]] in 1535 seeking gold.

Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=B\u00e1rbaros, page 66.

Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valpara\u00edso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nThe first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9 percent [[mestizo]]s, 8.6 percent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chilo\u00e9 Province|Chilo\u00e9]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of whom were whites and 33.5 percent of whom were natives.\n\nThe Diocese of [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chilo\u00e9.

A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] \u2013 heir to the deposed king \u2013 was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9 was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda|penetration into Araucan\u00eda]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes region]] joined the country in 1843, while the [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta region]], at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879.

The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors.

Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a [[de facto]] dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that have often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30\u201396}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u201352), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\n\nThe [[1964 Chilean presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830\u20131973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Salvador Allende]]]]\n\nIn the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the \"[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party.

In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836\u201339) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u201383), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nOn 26 June 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>{{cite web |title=Founding Member States |url=https://research.un.org/en/unmembers/founders |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 September 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704121608/https://research.un.org/en/unmembers/founders |archivedate=4 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chile |url=https://library.un.org/unms?combine=Chile |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 September 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914180256/https://library.un.org/unms?combine=Chile |archivedate=14 September 2019}}</ref> With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nSince its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena.

Peruvians claim the Northern part of Chile, which is now South West of Peru. This is also known as the \"triangulation\" which was made to fix the boundary problem between Chile and Peru. The decisions were accomplished on 27 January 1839 by the International Court of Justice <ref>{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Peter H. |title=Chile, Peru, and the ICJ Boundary Settlement |url=http://blogs.law.unc.edu/ncilj/2014/02/24/chile-peru-and-the-icj-boundary-settlement/ |website=North Carolina Journal of International Law |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This became the [[War of the Pacific]] which was in the years 1879\u20131883.<ref>{{cite web |title=War of the Pacific |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Pacific |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This conflict was caused by the mineral resources Chile had, Peruvians believed they belonged to them as well. Chile had to control sea shipping to Peru and sent out an army to invade Peru on 8 October 1879. The attempt was also made to The United States but failed badly on October 1880. There was a resistance between Peruvians and Chileans for a few years because they could not reach an agreement. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n. This was later signed by both of them on 20 October 1883 to keep peace between them. In 2008, Peru took Chile to court over their maritime disputes. Then later in 2014, the International Court of Justice's ruling resulted in Chile losing 80 miles from Northwestern ocean zone.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonnefoy |first1=Pascale |title=Court Grants Peru Ocean Territory Claimed by Chile |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/world/americas/court-grants-peru-ocean-territory-claimed-by-chile.html |newspaper=New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |accessdate=19 October 2018|date=28 January 2014 }}</ref> This ruling severely impacted fishers in the country making Chile lose a valuable trade in Northwest Chile.\n\nThe Chilean government has diplomatic relations with most countries.

Add to that the enormous length of Chile (over {{convert|4300|km|0|abbr=on}}) and this results in a wide range of climates and environments that can be divided into three general zones: the desert provinces of the north, central Chile, and the humid regions of the south.\n\n==== Flora and fauna====\n[[File:Araucaria araucana - Parque Nacional Conguill\u00edo por lautaroj - 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Araucaria araucana]] trees in Conguill\u00edo National Park.]]\n\nThe native flora of Chile consists of relatively fewer species compared to the flora of other South American countries. \nThe northernmost coastal and central region is largely barren of vegetation, approaching the most absolute desert in the world.<ref name=Icarito>{{Cite journal |author-link=La Tercera/Icarito |title=Icarito: Enciclopedia de la flora y fauna de Chile |journal=Icarito |url=http://www.icarito.cl/icarito/enciclopedia/canal/canal/0,0,38035857_152308989,00.html |id= |postscript=<!--None--> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410080253/http://www.icarito.cl/icarito/enciclopedia/canal/canal/0%2C0%2C38035857_152308989%2C00.html |archivedate=10 April 2006}}</ref>\nOn the slopes of the Andes, in addition to the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found.

To view maps based on [[SRTM]] topographic relief of the country, see [[:commons:Atlas of Chile/Clickable map|here]].]]\n[[File:Majestic Ojos del Salado volcano (4320230217).jpg|thumbnail|View of [[Ojos del Salado]] from the Chilean side.]]\n\nChile is located along a highly [[seismic]] and [[volcanic]] zone, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, due to the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates in the [[South American plate]].\n\nLate [[Paleozoic]], 251 million years ago, Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26\u00b0 S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\n[[File:Volcano Osorno and Petrohu\u00e9 waterfalls.JPG|thumbnail|[[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] and the [[Petrohu\u00e9 River]]]]\n[[File:Glaciar y laguna Nef, afluente Baker,.JPG|thumbnail|[[Nef Glacier]] and the Plomo Lake]]\n\nTo the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.\n\nThe [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].\n\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41\u00b0S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47\u00b0S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].\n\nEast of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n[[File:Lago General Carrera - Camino a Capilla de M\u00e1rmol.JPG|thumb|left|[[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera lake]], the largest in the country.]]\n\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow. They commonly extend from the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], flowing in an East to West.\n\nBecause of the [[Atacama desert]], in the Norte Grande there are only short [[endorheic]] character streams, except for the [[Loa River]], the longest in the country 440&nbsp;km.<ref name=hydr>{{cite journal |author1=Niemeyer, Hans |author2=Cereceda, Pilar |year=1983 |title=Hydrography |journal=Geography of Chile |publisher=[[Military Geographic Institute (Chile)|Military Geographic Institute]] |edition=1st |location=Santiago |volume=8 }}</ref> In the high valleys, wetland areas generate [[Chungar\u00e1 Lake]], located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the [[Lauca River]] are shared with [[Bolivia]], as well as the [[Lluta River]].\n\nIn the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> long, 142&nbsp;km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110&nbsp;km, and Maule with 240&nbsp;km. Their waters mainly flow from Andean snowmelt in the summer and winter rains. The major lakes in this area are the artificial lake Rapel, the Colbun Maule lagoon and the lagoon of La Laja.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Chile-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Population of Chile from 1820, projected up to 2050]]\n{{Main|Demographics of Chile}}\n\nChile's 2017 census reported a population of 17,574,003.

Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy. Now agriculture and allied sectors like [[forestry]], [[logging]] and [[fishing]] account for only 4.9% of the [[GDP]] {{As of|2007|lc=y}} and employ 13.6% of the country's labor force. Some major agriculture products of Chile include [[grapes]], [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[onion]]s, [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[oats]], [[peach]]es, [[garlic]], [[asparagus]], [[bean]]s, [[beef]], [[poultry]], [[wool]], [[fish]], [[timber]] and [[hemp]]. Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as [[mad cow disease]], [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] and [[Phylloxera]]. This, its location in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which has quite different harvesting times from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, Chile's mountainous landscape limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory. Chile currently utilizes 14,015 Hectares of agricultural land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chile.htm|title=Chile - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Chile}}\n[[File:Salar de Atacama.jpg|thumb|[[Salar de Atacama]] in the [[Atacama Desert]]]]\n[[File:Valle_del_Elqui,_La_Serena-Chile.JPG|thumb|[[Elqui Valley (wine region)|Elqui Valley]], wine and pisco region]]\n[[File:Cerro Concepcion.jpg|thumb|[[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n[[File:Puerto Varas Osorno.jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Varas]]]]\n\nTourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades.

He succeeded [[Fred Cozens]], [[Caddy Works]], and [[Wilbur Johns]]; Johns became the school's athletic director. Wooden signed a three-year contract for $6,000 in the first year. Prior to being hired at UCLA, he had been pursued for the head coaching position at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]], and it was his and his wife's desire to remain in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], but inclement weather in Minnesota prevented Wooden from receiving the scheduled phone offer from the Golden Gophers. Thinking that they had lost interest, Wooden instead accepted the head coaching job with the Bruins. Officials from the University of Minnesota contacted Wooden immediately after he accepted the position at UCLA, but he declined their offer because he had already given his word to UCLA.<ref name=\"Puma\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey \u2013 A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline \u2013 1948 |publisher = CoachWooden.com \u2013 The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = January 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWooden had immediate success, fashioning the mark of the rarest of coaches, an \"instant turnaround\" for an undistinguished, faltering program. Part of this success was due to his unique offensive system, the same system that countless coaches use today. John Wooden stated, \"I believe my system is perfectly suited to counter all the modern defenses I have seen, and that includes run-and-jump, 1\u20133\u20131 trapping, box-and-one, triangle-and-two, and switching man-to-man.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = John Wooden's UCLA Offense|last = Nater|first = Swen|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-7360-6180-3|location = Canada|pages = xvi}}</ref>\n\nPrior to Wooden's arrival at UCLA, the basketball program had only had two conference championship seasons in the previous 18 years. In his first season, he took a UCLA team that had posted a 12\u201313 record the previous year and transformed it into a [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC) Southern Division champion with a 22\u20137 record,<ref name=\"Puma\" /> the most wins in a season for UCLA since the school started playing basketball in 1919.<ref name=\"UCLA History\">{{cite web |url= http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/MBB_History_99-128.pdf |title = UCLA History |publisher = UCLA |pages = 118\u2013126 |year = 2007 |accessdate = January 29, 2010}}</ref> He surpassed that number the next season with 24\u20137 and a second division title and overall conference title in 1950, and would add two more in his first four years. Up to that time, UCLA had collected a total of two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and had not won a conference title of any sort since winning the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] in 1927.\n\n[[File:John Wooden - Southern Campus 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|Wooden in 1960]]\nIn spite of these achievements, Wooden reportedly did not initially enjoy his position, and his wife did not favor living in Los Angeles. When [[Mel Taube]] left Purdue in 1950, Wooden's inclination was to return to West Lafayette and finally accept the head coaching job there. He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded him that it was he who had insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word, even though Purdue offered more money, a car and housing.<ref name=\"Reilly2009\">{{cite magazine |author = Rick Reilly |author-link = Rick Reilly |date= October 19, 2009 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4557758 |title = Too Short For A Column |magazine = [[ESPN The Magazine]] |accessdate = January 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1955\u201356 season, Wooden had established a record of sustained success at UCLA. That year, he guided the team to its first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that came to an end only at the hands of [[Phil Woolpert]]'s [[San Francisco Dons men's basketball|University of San Francisco]] team (who had [[Bill Russell]] and [[K.C. Jones]]) that eventually won the [[1956 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1956 NCAA Tournament]]. However, UCLA was unable to advance from this level over the immediately ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament, as the [[Pete Newell]]-coached teams at the [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|University of California]] took control of the conference and won the [[1959 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1959 NCAA Tournament]]. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation that was imposed on all UCLA sports teams in the aftermath of a [[Pacific Coast Conference#The crisis|scandal]] that involved illegal payments made to players on the school's football team. The probation was also extended to three additional schools: the University of Southern California, California and Stanford.  The scandal resulted in the dismantling of the PCC conference.<ref name=\"Wolff\">{{cite news | author = Alex Wolff | date=June 4, 2010 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/alexander_wolff/06/03/wooden.1964/index.html | title=How '64 Bruins made John Wooden | publisher = [[SI.com]] |accessdate = July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1961\u20131962 season, the probation was no longer in place and Wooden returned his team to the top of the conference. This time, however, they would take the next step, and in so doing, unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college basketball. UCLA reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history. A narrow loss, due largely to a controversial foul call in a [[1962 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1962]] semi-final game against [[Ed Jucker]]'s eventual national champion [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] team, convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships.<ref name=\"Wolff\"/> Two seasons later in 1964, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach [[Jerry Norman (basketball)|Jerry Norman]] persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a [[zone press]] defense, which increased the probability of turnovers by the opposing team.<ref name=\"Wolff\"/> The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team that went 30\u20130 on its way to the school's first basketball national championship and first undefeated season as the Bruins beat [[Vic Bubas]]' taller and slower segregated Duke team 98\u201383 in the final. Walt Hazzard fouled out of the game late in the second half on a player control foul, but this was irrelevant when he cut down the net in celebration and was named tournament most valuable player. [[Gail Goodrich]], [[Keith Erickson]], [[Fred Slaughter]], and [[Jack Hirsch]]  contributed to the UCLA win. With no player taller than 6 feet, 5 inches, the Bruins' speed and zone press forced 29 turnovers and nullified the height advantage of Duke's Hack Tison and Jay Buckley, two 6-foot, 10-inch players.\n\nIn the 1964-1965 campaign, the defending NCAA champions got off to an ominous start when UCLA lost to Illinois by 27 points in its opening game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/ucla/1965-schedule.html|title=1964-65 UCLA Bruins Schedule and Results|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com}}</ref>  It was all uphill after that as the squad repeated as national champions with Gail Goodrich, [[Kenny Washington (basketball)|Kenny Washington]], and [[Doug McIntosh]]. The Bruins upended [[Dave Strack]]'s Michigan team 91\u201380 in the finals of the NCAA tournament. Goodrich shared Player of the Year honors with [[1964\u201365 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team|Princeton]]'s [[Bill Bradley]]. The 1966 squad was denied a chance at a triple crown when it finished second to [[Oregon State Beavers men's basketball|Oregon State]] in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (now the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]). UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference champions received a bid to the tournament. The Bruins' 1967 incarnation returned with a vengeance with sophomore star Alcindor, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30\u20130 season, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden's retirement immediately following the 1975 NCAA championship.\n\nThe resurgence of the Bruins under Wooden made it obvious that they needed a new home. Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the [[Men's Gym]]. It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal. This forced the Bruins to move games to [[Pan Pacific Auditorium]], the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] and other venues around Los Angeles when they were expected to attract larger crowds\u2014something that happened fairly often after the Bruins' first national title. At Wooden's urging, a much larger on-campus facility, [[Pauley Pavilion]], was built in time for the 1965\u201366 season. The building was christened on November 27, 1965, in a special game that pitted the UCLA varsity against the UCLA freshmen. It was [[Lew Alcindor]]'s (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) freshman season (freshmen were ineligible to play on the varsity in those days). UCLA was the defending national champion and ranked number 1 in the pre-season poll. The freshmen easily won the game by a score of  75\u201360. It was a powerful indication of things to come.\n\nA rule change was instituted for the 1967\u20131968 season, primarily because of Alcindor's towering play near the basket. The [[dunk shot]] was outlawed and would not be reinstated until the 1976\u20131977 season, which was shortly after Wooden's retirement. This was at least the second time that the rules committee had initiated change in response to the domination of a superstar player; in 1944, the [[goaltending]] rule was instituted to counter [[George Mikan]]'s dominant defensive play near the basket. In January, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston]], where the Bruins met [[Guy Lewis]]'s [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]] squad, who had [[Elvin Hayes]] and [[Ken Spain]], in the [[Game of the Century (college basketball)|Game of the Century]] in the nation's first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71\u201369, as Hayes scored 39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden said, \"We have to start over.\" UCLA went undefeated the rest of the year and thrashed Houston 101\u201369 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. ''Sports Illustrated'' ran the front cover headline ''Lew's Revenge. The rout of Houston''.<ref>https://www.sicovers.com/lew-alcindor-of-the-bruins-1968-april-01/</ref>  UCLA limited Hayes to only 10 points; he had been averaging 37.7 points per game. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Esper|first=Dwain|title=Bruins Hope Norman Stays|date=March 25, 1968|newspaper=The Independent|location=Pasadena, California|page=15|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2860094/|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}{{open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gasaway |first=John |title=John Wooden's Century |date=June 7, 2010 |work=Basketball Prospectus |url=http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=798 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723062332/http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=798 |archivedate=July 23, 2015 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Game of the Century is also remembered for an incident involving Wooden and [[Edgar Lacy]].

In addition to Alcindor, [[Lucius Allen]], [[Michael Warren (actor)|Mike Warren]], and [[Lynn Shackelford|\"Lefty\" Lynn Shackelford]] were given accolades. [[Kenny Heitz]] was also a member of UCLA's 1968 team.\n\nLew Alcindor finished his career at UCLA in 1969 with a third consecutive national championship when the Bruins beat [[George King (basketball, born 1928)|George King]]'s Purdue team 92\u201372 in the title game. The three straight titles were matched by three consecutive MVP awards in the tournament as Alcindor established himself as college basketball's superstar during the three-peat performance. Alcindor and Wooden would continue their communication even after he left UCLA. In 2017, Jabbar wrote a book, \"Coach Wooden and Me\", which details their long-standing friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nba/video/2017/05/16/kareem-abdul-jabbar-john-wooden-relationship|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on John Wooden and their history|website=SI.com}}</ref>\n\nA sportswriter commented that everybody outside of UCLA would be happy that glorious day in June when Alcindor finally graduated and college basketball could go back to the routine method of determining a national champion. This prophecy would prove to be ludicrous over the next six years. The 1970 squad proved that nobody was indispensable to the success of the UCLA program, not even Alcindor, as [[Sidney Wicks]], [[Henry Bibby]], [[Curtis Rowe]], [[John Vallely]], and [[Kenny Booker]] carried the Bruins to their fourth consecutive NCAA title with an 80\u201369 win over upstart [[Jacksonville Dolphins men's basketball|Jacksonville]], coached by [[Joe Williams (basketball)|Joe Williams]]. Wicks and Rowe double teamed 7-foot [[Artis Gilmore]] on defense and shut down the high-powered Jacksonville offense, which had been averaging 100 points per game. Gilmore and 5'10\" Rex Morgan had been dubbed \"Batman and Robin\" by the press.\n\nIn the 1971 NCAA championship game, [[Steve Patterson (basketball)|Steve Patterson]] outscored [[Howard Porter (basketball)|Howard Porter]] of [[Jack Kraft]]'s scandal-plagued Villanova squad as UCLA won 68\u201362. The following year, UCLA had its closest game in all of Wooden's 10 championships, beating [[Hugh Durham]]'s Florida State team 81\u201376 to take the 1972 title. After the game, Bill Walton said, \"We didn't play well.\"\n\n[[File:Wooden with game ball from Phelps.png|thumb|upright|left|200px|Wooden with [[Digger Phelps]] in 1973, after UCLA beat Notre Dame for their NCAA-record 61st straight win]]\nThe 1972\u20131973 season was one of the most memorable campaigns in the history of UCLA basketball. Freshmen became eligible to play varsity ball again, and the Bruins went 30\u20130 and stretched their winning streak to a record 75 straight in breezing through the NCAA tournament by blowing out [[Gene Bartow]]'s Memphis State team 87\u201366 in the final, as Bill Walton hit an incredible 21 of 22 field goal attempts. Walton and Wooden were everybody's Player and Coach of the Year again. [[Keith Wilkes]], [[Greg Lee (basketball)|Greg Lee]], and [[Larry Hollyfield]] were members of that team, and Wilkes would go on to win four NBA championships as well.\n\nUCLA's two big streaks came to an end during the 1973\u20131974 season. In January, the winning streak stopped at 88 games when [[Digger Phelps]]'s Notre Dame squad upended the Bruins 71\u201370 in South Bend. Two months later, [[Norm Sloan]]'s [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]] team defeated UCLA 80\u201377 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] was NC State's All-American, and [[Tom Burleson]] did an excellent job on defense against Bill Walton. UCLA had beaten the Wolfpack by 18 points early in the season, but things were different when they met in March.\n\nWooden coached what would prove to be his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, a 93\u201359 victory over [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]]. Four weeks later, following a 75\u201374 overtime victory over former player and former assistant coach [[Denny Crum]] and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the championship game.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | date=March 30, 1975 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YLITAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mNkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4232,7431027&hl=en | title=Wooden hangs 'em up | newspaper = [[Eugene Register-Guard]] |accessdate = July 23, 2010}}</ref> His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly when [[Richard Washington]] and [[Dave Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]] combined for 52 points as UCLA responded with a 92\u201385 win over [[Joe B.

John Wooden stated, \"I believe my system is perfectly suited to counter all the modern defenses I have seen, and that includes run-and-jump, 1\u20133\u20131 trapping, box-and-one, triangle-and-two, and switching man-to-man.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = John Wooden's UCLA Offense|last = Nater|first = Swen|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-7360-6180-3|location = Canada|pages = xvi}}</ref>\n\nPrior to Wooden's arrival at UCLA, the basketball program had only had two conference championship seasons in the previous 18 years. In his first season, he took a UCLA team that had posted a 12\u201313 record the previous year and transformed it into a [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC) Southern Division champion with a 22\u20137 record,<ref name=\"Puma\" /> the most wins in a season for UCLA since the school started playing basketball in 1919.<ref name=\"UCLA History\">{{cite web |url= http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/MBB_History_99-128.pdf |title = UCLA History |publisher = UCLA |pages = 118\u2013126 |year = 2007 |accessdate = January 29, 2010}}</ref> He surpassed that number the next season with 24\u20137 and a second division title and overall conference title in 1950, and would add two more in his first four years. Up to that time, UCLA had collected a total of two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and had not won a conference title of any sort since winning the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] in 1927.\n\n[[File:John Wooden - Southern Campus 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|Wooden in 1960]]\nIn spite of these achievements, Wooden reportedly did not initially enjoy his position, and his wife did not favor living in Los Angeles. When [[Mel Taube]] left Purdue in 1950, Wooden's inclination was to return to West Lafayette and finally accept the head coaching job there. He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded him that it was he who had insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word, even though Purdue offered more money, a car and housing.<ref name=\"Reilly2009\">{{cite magazine |author = Rick Reilly |author-link = Rick Reilly |date= October 19, 2009 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4557758 |title = Too Short For A Column |magazine = [[ESPN The Magazine]] |accessdate = January 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1955\u201356 season, Wooden had established a record of sustained success at UCLA. That year, he guided the team to its first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that came to an end only at the hands of [[Phil Woolpert]]'s [[San Francisco Dons men's basketball|University of San Francisco]] team (who had [[Bill Russell]] and [[K.C. Jones]]) that eventually won the [[1956 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1956 NCAA Tournament]]. However, UCLA was unable to advance from this level over the immediately ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament, as the [[Pete Newell]]-coached teams at the [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|University of California]] took control of the conference and won the [[1959 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1959 NCAA Tournament]]. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation that was imposed on all UCLA sports teams in the aftermath of a [[Pacific Coast Conference#The crisis|scandal]] that involved illegal payments made to players on the school's football team. The probation was also extended to three additional schools: the University of Southern California, California and Stanford.  The scandal resulted in the dismantling of the PCC conference.<ref name=\"Wolff\">{{cite news | author = Alex Wolff | date=June 4, 2010 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/alexander_wolff/06/03/wooden.1964/index.html | title=How '64 Bruins made John Wooden | publisher = [[SI.com]] |accessdate = July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1961\u20131962 season, the probation was no longer in place and Wooden returned his team to the top of the conference. This time, however, they would take the next step, and in so doing, unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college basketball. UCLA reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history. A narrow loss, due largely to a controversial foul call in a [[1962 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1962]] semi-final game against [[Ed Jucker]]'s eventual national champion [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] team, convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships.<ref name=\"Wolff\"/> Two seasons later in 1964, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach [[Jerry Norman (basketball)|Jerry Norman]] persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a [[zone press]] defense, which increased the probability of turnovers by the opposing team.<ref name=\"Wolff\"/> The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team that went 30\u20130 on its way to the school's first basketball national championship and first undefeated season as the Bruins beat [[Vic Bubas]]' taller and slower segregated Duke team 98\u201383 in the final. Walt Hazzard fouled out of the game late in the second half on a player control foul, but this was irrelevant when he cut down the net in celebration and was named tournament most valuable player. [[Gail Goodrich]], [[Keith Erickson]], [[Fred Slaughter]], and [[Jack Hirsch]]  contributed to the UCLA win. With no player taller than 6 feet, 5 inches, the Bruins' speed and zone press forced 29 turnovers and nullified the height advantage of Duke's Hack Tison and Jay Buckley, two 6-foot, 10-inch players.\n\nIn the 1964-1965 campaign, the defending NCAA champions got off to an ominous start when UCLA lost to Illinois by 27 points in its opening game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/ucla/1965-schedule.html|title=1964-65 UCLA Bruins Schedule and Results|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com}}</ref>  It was all uphill after that as the squad repeated as national champions with Gail Goodrich, [[Kenny Washington (basketball)|Kenny Washington]], and [[Doug McIntosh]]. The Bruins upended [[Dave Strack]]'s Michigan team 91\u201380 in the finals of the NCAA tournament. Goodrich shared Player of the Year honors with [[1964\u201365 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team|Princeton]]'s [[Bill Bradley]]. The 1966 squad was denied a chance at a triple crown when it finished second to [[Oregon State Beavers men's basketball|Oregon State]] in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (now the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]). UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference champions received a bid to the tournament. The Bruins' 1967 incarnation returned with a vengeance with sophomore star Alcindor, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30\u20130 season, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden's retirement immediately following the 1975 NCAA championship.\n\nThe resurgence of the Bruins under Wooden made it obvious that they needed a new home. Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the [[Men's Gym]]. It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal. This forced the Bruins to move games to [[Pan Pacific Auditorium]], the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] and other venues around Los Angeles when they were expected to attract larger crowds\u2014something that happened fairly often after the Bruins' first national title. At Wooden's urging, a much larger on-campus facility, [[Pauley Pavilion]], was built in time for the 1965\u201366 season. The building was christened on November 27, 1965, in a special game that pitted the UCLA varsity against the UCLA freshmen. It was [[Lew Alcindor]]'s (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) freshman season (freshmen were ineligible to play on the varsity in those days). UCLA was the defending national champion and ranked number 1 in the pre-season poll. The freshmen easily won the game by a score of  75\u201360. It was a powerful indication of things to come.\n\nA rule change was instituted for the 1967\u20131968 season, primarily because of Alcindor's towering play near the basket. The [[dunk shot]] was outlawed and would not be reinstated until the 1976\u20131977 season, which was shortly after Wooden's retirement. This was at least the second time that the rules committee had initiated change in response to the domination of a superstar player; in 1944, the [[goaltending]] rule was instituted to counter [[George Mikan]]'s dominant defensive play near the basket. In January, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston]], where the Bruins met [[Guy Lewis]]'s [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]] squad, who had [[Elvin Hayes]] and [[Ken Spain]], in the [[Game of the Century (college basketball)|Game of the Century]] in the nation's first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71\u201369, as Hayes scored 39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden said, \"We have to start over.\" UCLA went undefeated the rest of the year and thrashed Houston 101\u201369 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. ''Sports Illustrated'' ran the front cover headline ''Lew's Revenge. The rout of Houston''.<ref>https://www.sicovers.com/lew-alcindor-of-the-bruins-1968-april-01/</ref>  UCLA limited Hayes to only 10 points; he had been averaging 37.7 points per game. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Esper|first=Dwain|title=Bruins Hope Norman Stays|date=March 25, 1968|newspaper=The Independent|location=Pasadena, California|page=15|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2860094/|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}{{open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gasaway |first=John |title=John Wooden's Century |date=June 7, 2010 |work=Basketball Prospectus |url=http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=798 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723062332/http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=798 |archivedate=July 23, 2015 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Game of the Century is also remembered for an incident involving Wooden and [[Edgar Lacy]].

In addition to Alcindor, [[Lucius Allen]], [[Michael Warren (actor)|Mike Warren]], and [[Lynn Shackelford|\"Lefty\" Lynn Shackelford]] were given accolades. [[Kenny Heitz]] was also a member of UCLA's 1968 team.\n\nLew Alcindor finished his career at UCLA in 1969 with a third consecutive national championship when the Bruins beat [[George King (basketball, born 1928)|George King]]'s Purdue team 92\u201372 in the title game. The three straight titles were matched by three consecutive MVP awards in the tournament as Alcindor established himself as college basketball's superstar during the three-peat performance. Alcindor and Wooden would continue their communication even after he left UCLA. In 2017, Jabbar wrote a book, \"Coach Wooden and Me\", which details their long-standing friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nba/video/2017/05/16/kareem-abdul-jabbar-john-wooden-relationship|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on John Wooden and their history|website=SI.com}}</ref>\n\nA sportswriter commented that everybody outside of UCLA would be happy that glorious day in June when Alcindor finally graduated and college basketball could go back to the routine method of determining a national champion. This prophecy would prove to be ludicrous over the next six years. The 1970 squad proved that nobody was indispensable to the success of the UCLA program, not even Alcindor, as [[Sidney Wicks]], [[Henry Bibby]], [[Curtis Rowe]], [[John Vallely]], and [[Kenny Booker]] carried the Bruins to their fourth consecutive NCAA title with an 80\u201369 win over upstart [[Jacksonville Dolphins men's basketball|Jacksonville]], coached by [[Joe Williams (basketball)|Joe Williams]]. Wicks and Rowe double teamed 7-foot [[Artis Gilmore]] on defense and shut down the high-powered Jacksonville offense, which had been averaging 100 points per game. Gilmore and 5'10\" Rex Morgan had been dubbed \"Batman and Robin\" by the press.\n\nIn the 1971 NCAA championship game, [[Steve Patterson (basketball)|Steve Patterson]] outscored [[Howard Porter (basketball)|Howard Porter]] of [[Jack Kraft]]'s scandal-plagued Villanova squad as UCLA won 68\u201362. The following year, UCLA had its closest game in all of Wooden's 10 championships, beating [[Hugh Durham]]'s Florida State team 81\u201376 to take the 1972 title. After the game, Bill Walton said, \"We didn't play well.\"\n\n[[File:Wooden with game ball from Phelps.png|thumb|upright|left|200px|Wooden with [[Digger Phelps]] in 1973, after UCLA beat Notre Dame for their NCAA-record 61st straight win]]\nThe 1972\u20131973 season was one of the most memorable campaigns in the history of UCLA basketball. Freshmen became eligible to play varsity ball again, and the Bruins went 30\u20130 and stretched their winning streak to a record 75 straight in breezing through the NCAA tournament by blowing out [[Gene Bartow]]'s Memphis State team 87\u201366 in the final, as Bill Walton hit an incredible 21 of 22 field goal attempts. Walton and Wooden were everybody's Player and Coach of the Year again. [[Keith Wilkes]], [[Greg Lee (basketball)|Greg Lee]], and [[Larry Hollyfield]] were members of that team, and Wilkes would go on to win four NBA championships as well.\n\nUCLA's two big streaks came to an end during the 1973\u20131974 season. In January, the winning streak stopped at 88 games when [[Digger Phelps]]'s Notre Dame squad upended the Bruins 71\u201370 in South Bend. Two months later, [[Norm Sloan]]'s [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]] team defeated UCLA 80\u201377 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] was NC State's All-American, and [[Tom Burleson]] did an excellent job on defense against Bill Walton. UCLA had beaten the Wolfpack by 18 points early in the season, but things were different when they met in March.\n\nWooden coached what would prove to be his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, a 93\u201359 victory over [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]]. Four weeks later, following a 75\u201374 overtime victory over former player and former assistant coach [[Denny Crum]] and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the championship game.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | date=March 30, 1975 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YLITAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mNkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4232,7431027&hl=en | title=Wooden hangs 'em up | newspaper = [[Eugene Register-Guard]] |accessdate = July 23, 2010}}</ref> His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly when [[Richard Washington]] and [[Dave Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]] combined for 52 points as UCLA responded with a 92\u201385 win over [[Joe B.

A salmon cannery was built on the Unimak Island side of the strait in 1919 <ref>''Pacific Fisherman'', vol 18, p.103, M. Freeman, Portland, Oregon, 1920</ref> which provided the nucleus for the modern settlement. A U.S. post office with the name of False Pass was established in 1921 which gave official status to the community.<ref>Orth, Donald J.: ''Dictionary of Alaska Place Names'', Geological Survey professional paper, 567, 1967, USGPO, Washington</ref>\n\nCommercial fishing for salmon, cod, halibut and crab continues to be the core of the community's lifestyle and economy.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:City false pass alaska boundaries.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Boundaries of the City of False Pass|Boundaries of the city of False Pass, Alaska]]False Pass is at {{Coord|54|49|40|N|163|23|57|W|type:city}} (54.827886, -163.399090).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is near the eastern end of [[Unimak Island]], in the [[Aleutian Islands]] chain.

The strait was called \"False Pass\" by early American sailing ship captains because it was thought to be impassable for their [[Draft (hull)|deep draft]] vessels at the northern end.  A salmon cannery was built on the Unimak Island side of the strait in 1919 <ref>''Pacific Fisherman'', vol 18, p.103, M. Freeman, Portland, Oregon, 1920</ref> which provided the nucleus for the modern settlement. A U.S. post office with the name of False Pass was established in 1921 which gave official status to the community.<ref>Orth, Donald J.: ''Dictionary of Alaska Place Names'', Geological Survey professional paper, 567, 1967, USGPO, Washington</ref>\n\nCommercial fishing for salmon, cod, halibut and crab continues to be the core of the community's lifestyle and economy.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:City false pass alaska boundaries.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Boundaries of the City of False Pass|Boundaries of the city of False Pass, Alaska]]False Pass is at {{Coord|54|49|40|N|163|23|57|W|type:city}} (54.827886, -163.399090).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is near the eastern end of [[Unimak Island]], in the [[Aleutian Islands]] chain.

The national organizations, in turn, are part of both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World Alliance of YMCAs (World YMCA).

Williams' idea grew out of meetings he held for prayer and Bible-reading among his fellow workers in a business in the city of London,<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Young Men's Christian Association |volume=28 |pages=940\u2013941}}</ref> and on 6 June 1844, he held the first meeting that led to the founding of YMCA with the purpose of \"the improving of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery, [[embroidery]], and other trades.\"<ref name=\"report\">[[#IC95|Report of the Thirteenth International Conference]]: xix</ref> [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]] served as YMCA's first president from 1851 until his death in 1885.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of British History|last=Cannon|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780191044809|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nBy 1845, YMCA started a popular series of lectures held that went on to be held at [[Exeter Hall]], London, from 1848, and the lectures started being published the following year, with the series ran until 1865.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Journal of Victorian Culture|last=Finnegan|first=Diarmid A.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=46\u201364}}</ref>\n\nYMCA was associated with [[Industrialisation]] and the movement of young people to cities to work. YMCA \"combined preaching in the streets and the distribution of religious tracts with a social ministry. Philanthropists saw them as places for wholesome recreation that would preserve youth from the temptations of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and that would promote good citizenship.\"<ref name=\"frost\">J. William Frost, \"Part V: Christianity and Culture in America\", ''Christianity: A Social and Cultural History'', 2nd Edition, (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1998), 476.</ref>\n\n=== Movement ===\nIn part thanks to using the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 to spread the idea of YMCA,<ref name=\":3\" /> by later that year there were YMCAs in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\nThe idea of creating a truly global movement with an international headquarters was led by [[Henry Dunant]], Secretary of YMCA Geneva, who would later go on to found the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and win the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  Dunant successfully convinced YMCA Paris to organise the first YMCA World Conference. The Conference took place in August 1855, bringing together 99 young delegates from nine countries, held before the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]]. They discussed joining together in a federation to enhance cooperation amongst individual YMCA societies. This marked the beginning of the World Alliance of YMCAs. The conference adopted the [[Paris Basis]], a common mission for all present and future national YMCAs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=115 |title=Paris Basis |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> Its motto was taken from the Bible, \"[[That they all may be one]]\" ([[John 17]]:21).\n\nOther ecumenical bodies, such as the World [[YWCA]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] have reflected elements of the Paris Basis in their founding mission statements. In 1865, the Fourth World Conference of YMCAs, held in Germany, affirmed the importance of developing the whole individual in spirit, mind, and body. The concept of physical work through sports, a new concept for the time, was also recognized as part of this \"[[muscular Christianity]]\".\n\nTwo themes resonated during the council: the need to respect the local autonomy of YMCA societies, and the purpose of YMCA: to unite all young, male Christians for the extension and expansion of the Kingdom of God. The former idea is expressed in the preamble:\n\n{{quote|The delegates of various Young Men's Christian Associations of Europe and America, assembled in Conference at Paris, the 22 August 1855 feeling that they are one in principle and in operation, recommend to their respective Societies to recognize with them the unity existing among their Associations, and while preserving a complete independence as to their particular organization and modes of action, to form a Confederation of secession on the following fundamental principle, such principle to be regarded as the basis of admission of other Societies in future.}}\n\n=== 1870s to 1910s ===\n[[File:KINO YMCA.JPG|thumb|YMCA building in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia]]\n\nYMCA was very influential during the 1870s and the 1930s, during which times it most successfully promoted \"evangelical Christianity in weekday and Sunday services, while promoting good sportsmanship in athletic contests in gyms (where [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] were invented) and swimming pools.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>  Later in this period, and continuing on through the 20th century, YMCA had \"become interdenominational and more concerned with promoting morality and good citizenship than a distinctive interpretation of Christianity.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>[[File:Geneve archives YMCA 2011-08-23 11 24 53 PICT4048.JPG|thumb|left|Logo of the World Alliance of YMCAs (YMCA Archive, Geneva)]]\n\nIn 1878, the World YMCA offices were established in [[Geneva]], Switzerland by Dunant. Later, in 1900, North American YMCAs, in collaboration with the World YMCA, set up centres to work with emigrants in European ports, as millions of people were leaving for the USA. In 1880, YMCA became the first national organization to adopt a strict policy of equal gender representation in committees and national boards, with Norway being the country that first adopted it.\n\nIn 1885, Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley), the first residential camp in the United States and North America, was established by George A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley, both of whom worked for YMCA.

Robinson]], a Chicago-area YMCA administrator, worked at YMCA while also becoming the BSA's first director.[[File:PikiWiki Israel 612 YMCA \u05d9.\u05de.\u05e7.\u05d0..JPG|thumb|YMCA in [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nIn 1916, [[K. T. Paul]] became the first Indian national general secretary of India. Paul had started rural development programs for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. He also coined the term \"rural reconstruction\", and many of the principles he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community development programs. In 1923, [[Y. C. James Yen]], of YMCA China, devised the \"thousand character system\", based on pilot projects in education. The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement. In 1878, YMCA was organized inside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem<ref>his</ref> and the current landmark building was dedicated by General Lord Allenby in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine.\n\n=== The World Wars ===\n\nWithin ten days of the declaration of [[World War I]],  YMCA had established no fewer than 250 recreation centres, also known as huts, in the United Kingdom, and would go on to build temporary huts across Europe to support both soldiers and civilians alike, run by thousands of volunteers.

This help included helping young men leave the camps to attend Springfield College and providing youth activities in the camps. In addition, YMCA was one of seven organizations that helped to found the [[USO]] during World War II.\n\nIn Europe, YMCA international helped refugees, particularly displaced Jews.

It stated what had become obvious:  that a global viewpoint was more necessary. It also recognized that YMCA and its national member organizations would have to take political stands, particularly in international challenges and crises.

The national organizations, in turn, are affiliated to both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World YMCA. The World YMCA is the highest affiliation body. Each local, national and regional YMCA is independent of each other, but local, regional and international cooperation, partnerships and collaborations are part of the organizations work. Each National Council is led by a National General Secretary, a role that is akin to that of a CEO.\n\nEver since the first World Conference in August 1855, in Paris, the World YMCA has convened a World Conference (later named World Council) every three to four years and is YMCA's highest decision making forum. Every National Council sends a delegation who hold a number of votes, which are dependent on the financial turnover of that National Council. The World Council is \u201cresponsible for setting the policies and direction of the World YMCA, electing its Officers and Executive Committee, evaluating the work of the last four years, and deliberating on priorities for the next quadrennium\".

The circular emblem is made up of five segments, one for each continent. The segments are held together by small monograms of YMCA in different languages. As early as 1881, YMCA leaders believed the Movement could be truly international and united across borders. In the center is a larger monogram of X and P, [[Chi Rho|Chi and Rho]], Christ's name, as used by early Christians. An open Bible sits on top of the monogram, showing [[That they all may be one|John XVII, Verse 21, \"that they all may be one\"]]. This was to remind YMCAs that Christ is at the center of the Movement, a source of strength, hope and unity, binding them all together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ymca.int/about-us/ymca-history/ymca-logo-history/|title=YMCA Logo - History|website=World YMCA}}</ref>\n\nIn 1891 [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], a physical education director at YMCA of the USA, introduced a new emblem to represent YMCA, an inverted red triangle. Each of the triangle's sides represented 'the whole man' and a different aspect of YMCA's work as recognised by Gulick; Mind, Body and Spirit.<ref>https://infed.org/mobi/luther-halsey-gulick-recreation-physical-education-and-the-ymca/</ref> So significant was the red triangle, it would go on to become a familiar symbol of YMCA's work on the home front and around the world during WW1 and WW2. The red triangle is still used as part of many local, national and regional YMCA logos today.\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Accommodation ===\nYMCAs around the world offer various types of accommodation. In some places this takes the form of budget accommodation available to the public such as youth hostels, or hotels which in turn generate income for other charitable activities. In England and Wales, YMCAs offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people.<ref name=\"Accommodation\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/accommodation|title=Accommodation|website=YMCA England & Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Education and Academia ===\n\nMultiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to YMCA. [[Springfield College]], of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]\u2014[[Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams College]]\u2014started from night courses offered at the [[Montreal]] YMCA. [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] began out of a [[Boston YMCA|YMCA in Boston]], and [[Franklin University]] began as YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's [[Golden Gate University]] traces its roots to the founding of YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. [[Detroit College of Law]], now the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. [[Youngstown State University]] traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The [[Nashville School of Law]] was YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of [[Juris Doctor]] since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of [[wikt:night school|night school]], providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer [[English as a second language|ESL]] programs, [[alternative high school]], [[day care]], and [[summer camp]] programs. In India, [[YMCA University of Science and Technology]] [[Faridabad]] was founded in 1969. It offers various program-related to science and engineering.\n\nAmerican high school students have a chance to participate in [[YMCA Youth and Government]], wherein clubs of children representing each YMCA community convene annually in their respective [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to \"take over the State Capitol for a day.\"\n\nAmerican students in [[Title One]] public schools are sometimes eligible to join a tutoring program through YMCA called Y Learning. This program is used to help low-income students who are struggling in school complete their homework with help from tutors and receive a snack as well as a safe place to be after school. Y Learning operates under the main mission of bridging achievements gaps and providing essential resources to help underprivileged students thrive in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymcatriangle.org/programs-services/tutoring/y-learning|title=Y Learning, standardized tutorial program {{!}} YMCA of the Triangle|website=www.ymcatriangle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe International Coalition of YMCA Universities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymcauniversitiescoalition.org/|title=Coalition YMCA Universities|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> brings together universities from all over the world, including Brazil, England, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela. The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.\n\n=== Health and Wellbeing ===\n[[File:YMCA Association Men Cover June 1919.png|thumbnail|right|YMCA ''Association Men'' cover, June 1919]]\n\nIn 1891 [[James Naismith]], a Canadian American, invented [[Basketball]] while studying at YMCA International Training School in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] (later to be named [[Springfield College]]). Naismith had been asked to invent a new game in an attempt to interest pupils in physical exercise. The game had to be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play indoors in winter. In 1895, [[William G. Morgan]] from YMCA of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], invented the sport of [[Volleyball]] as a slower paced alternative sport, in which the older YMCA members could participate. In 1930, {{illm|Juan Carlos Ceriani|fr|Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier}} from YMCA of [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, invented the sport of [[futsal]], an indoor version of [[Association football|football]], having been created in synthesis with the rules of the three indoor sports of [[American handball|handball]], basketball and [[water polo]].\n\n==== Public Health ====\nThe organization is committed to public health in different ways. It organizes fitness and wellness as well as help and awareness programs. One of the programs is the ''Diabetes Prevention Program'', where trained staff members help sick persons to make their lives healthy and active.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/at-a-ymca-near-you-a-course-for-a-diabetic-nation/|title=At a YMCA Near You, a Course for a Diabetic Nation|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|date=2014-07-03|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n====Basketball====\nBasketball was invented at YMCA, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a clergyman, educator and physician.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://eu.courierpress.com/story/life/2018/01/30/history-lesson-early-basketball-ymca/1077521001/\n | title =History Lesson: Early basketball at YMCA\n | last =Smith \n | first =Daniel\n | date =30 January 2018\n | website =Courier & Press\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 2 January 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> Naismith was asked to create an indoor \"athletic distraction\" to keep rowdy youth busy in the cold New England winter months. [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], the head of  Springfield YMCA, gave Naismith two weeks to come up with a game to occupy a particularly incorrigible group. Naismith decided the game had to be physically active, simple to understand and would have minimal physical roughness.\n\nThe original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to the balcony of Springfield YMCA. The game was an immediate hit, although originally the baskets still had their bottoms, and the ball had to be manually retrieved after each score, considerably slowing play. It was mostly a passing game, and dribbling did not become a major part of the game until much later, when the ball was improved to its present form.\n\nGulick worked with Naismith to spread the sport, chairing the Basketball Committee of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (1895\u20131905) and representing the [[United States Olympic Committee]] during the [[1908 Olympic Games]]. Naismith and his wife attended the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] when basketball was included for the first time as an Olympic event.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Book of the Olympics|last=Loucky, Wallechinsky|first=David and Jamie|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=399\u2013400}}</ref> For his efforts to increase the popularity of basketball and of [[physical fitness]] in general, Gulick was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a contributor in 1959.\n\n====Volleyball====\nFour years after James Naismith invented basketball in Springfield in 1891, [[William G. Morgan]], an instructor at YMCA in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], wanted to create a game for older gentlemen which had less physical contact. He borrowed a tennis net, raised it 6 feet, 6 inches above the floor, and invented the game of \"mintonette\", which could be played by a group of any number and involved volleying a large ball over the net. An observer wisely suggested that a better name for the new sport might be \"volleyball\".\n\n====Racquetball====\nRacquetball is another YMCA invented sport. [[Joseph Sobek]] a tennis, handball and squash player who worked in a rubber manufacturing factory, was dissatisfied with the options for indoor sports in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He could not find squash players of his caliber and he did not care particularly for handball, so in 1950 he designed a short, stringed racquet, used a children's toy rubber ball, and created rules for a new game using the handball courts. He called his new sport \"paddle rackets\".

Around six years after its birth, an international YMCA conference in Paris decided that the objective of the organization should become \"[[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian discipleship]] developed through a program of religious, educational, social and physical activities\" (Binfield 1973:265).\n\n== Europe ==\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nYMCAs in England and Wales offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people, mental health services, youth clubs, sports centres, nursery schools and family support and after school clubs. Across England and Wales YMCA supports more than 18,000 young people with homes each year,<ref name=\"Accommodation\"/> and is thus one of the largest providers of safe supported accommodation for young people. The vast majority of this accommodation is supported by a range of personal, social and educational services.\n\nThe archive of the British YMCA is housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections. The archive of YMCA Scotland is available at the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. YMCA in the United Kingdom consists of three separate National Councils: England & Wales, Ireland, and [[Scotland]].

Up until 1985 the organisation was called \u2018Christlicher Verein Junger M\u00e4nner\u2019 (Christian Association of Young Men), the name change reflected its activities being accessible to men and women.\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThe [[YWCA-YMCA of Sweden]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''KFUK-KFUM Sverige''''') was established in 1966 following a merger of the YMCA of Sweden and the YWCA of Sweden. In 2011, the organization decided to use the term '''''KFUM Sverige''''' during promotion where ''M'' now stands for ''m\u00e4nniskor'' (\"people\") instead of ''m\u00e4n'' (men) as before. The YWCA-YMCA of Sweden has 40,000 members in 140 local associations.

By 1904, there were two more branches in Mexico City and one branch established in Monterrey. In 1907, another branch in Chihuahua was set up and then one YMCA in Tampico. In Mexico, the YMCA organized physical activity, individual development, and national progress. There was advertising for YMCA programs that would help young men gain life skills and YMCA also had some activities for women. For example, an excursion to Xochimilco in 1910 featured races for boys and girls and indoor baseball for everyone.

It was founded in 1851 by Captain Thomas Valentine Sullivan (1800\u201359), an American seaman and missionary. He was influenced by the London YMCA and saw the association as an opportunity to provide a \"home away from home\" for young sailors on shore leave. The [[Boston YMCA|Boston chapter]] promoted evangelical Christianity, the cultivation of Christian sympathy, and the improvement of the spiritual, physical, and mental condition of young men. By 1853, the Boston YMCA had 1,500 members, most of whom were merchants and artisans. Hardware merchant [[Franklin W. Smith]] was the first elected president in 1855.<ref name=\"BORDER\">Howell, Benita J.: [http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf \"Franklin Webster Smith of Boston: Architect of Tourism in Busby, Tennessee\"] Border States: Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, 2003</ref>\nMembers paid an annual membership fee to use the facilities and services of the association. Because of political, physical, and population changes in Boston during the second half of the century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs of local neighborhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational classes. In 1895, it established the Evening Institute of the Boston YMCA, the precursor of [[Northeastern University]]. From 1899 to 1968, the association established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 31 branches and centers. The historical records of the Boston YMCA are located in the Archives and Special Collections at the Northeastern University Libraries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m13find.htm |title=Young Men's Christian Association of Greater Boston records |publisher=Library.neu.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], had its first YMCA in 1852, a few blocks west of Charles Street with later an extensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style triangular structure of brick with limestone trim with two towers at the northwest and southwest ends and two smaller cupolas in the center, built by 1872\u201373 on the northwest corner of West Saratoga and [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles Streets]], the former site of the city's first Roman Catholic church (St. Peter's, 1770) and pro-cathedral (1791\u20131826), but razed in 1841. The first central Baltimore YMCA, which still stands in 2014 (but with its towers removed in the early 1900s, converted to offices in the 1910s and apartments and condos in 2001) at the northern edge of the downtown business district near Cathedral Hill and the more toney residential [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal]] neighborhood with many of the city's cultural and educational institutions relocating. By 1907, three blocks further north, a cornerstone was laid for a [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts/Classical Revival]] styled, seven-story building on the northeast corner of West Franklin at Cathedral Streets, across the street to the north from the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] (the old Baltimore Cathedral) of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1806\u201321). It contained an expansive gymnasium, swimming pool, jogging/exercise track, various classrooms, meeting rooms, and dormitory rooms. Two decades later, the city's central branch of the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] public circulating library system (first of its kind in America) expanded from its original \"Old Central\" a block south facing West Mulberry Street to a new block-long library facing Cathedral Street and the Cathedral/Basilica in 1931\u20131933, with distinctive department store front display windows on the sidewalk, giving the area a unique cultural and educational centrality. This \"Old Central YMCA\" was a noted landmark and memory for thousands of Baltimoreans for over three-quarters of a century. It later was converted to the present Mount Vernon Hotel and Caf\u00e9 as the Baltimore area's Central YMCA of central Maryland reorganized in the early 1980s and cut back on its various activities in the downtown area to more suburban and neighborhood centers throughout the region (although not without controversy and some alienation as the \"Old Central\" was closed). Additional YMCA work was undertaken in what was then called the \"Colored YMCA\" in the inner northwest neighborhood of [[Upton, Baltimore|Upton]] on [[Maryland Route 127|Druid Hill Avenue]] near the traditional \"Black\" Pennsylvania Avenue commercial/cultural district which were undertaken by committed then \"Negro/Colored\" residents, who persevered in the early 20th century despite very little encouragement and hardly any financial resources from the board of the Central YMCA of Baltimore.\n\nIn 1853 the Reverend [[Anthony Bowen]] founded the first YMCA for Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA is still serving the U Street area of Washington. It became a part of YMCA of the city of Washington in 1947.\n\nYMCA developed the first known English as a Second Language program in the United States in response to the influx of immigrants in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcagbc.org/about-y/y|title=The Y|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nStarting before the [[American Civil War]],<ref name=YMCAhistory/> YMCA provided nursing, shelter, and other support in wartime.\n\nIn 1879 Darren Blach organized the first [[Sioux]] Indian YMCA in Florida.

YMCA secretaries worked to create camp committees to run programs providing educational opportunities, physical instruction, and equipment, theatrical productions and musicals.

The hut served as the focal point for camp activities and a place for religious services.

The national organizations, in turn, are part of both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World Alliance of YMCAs (World YMCA).

YMCA \"combined preaching in the streets and the distribution of religious tracts with a social ministry. Philanthropists saw them as places for wholesome recreation that would preserve youth from the temptations of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and that would promote good citizenship.\"<ref name=\"frost\">J.

Dunant successfully convinced YMCA Paris to organise the first YMCA World Conference. The Conference took place in August 1855, bringing together 99 young delegates from nine countries, held before the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]]. They discussed joining together in a federation to enhance cooperation amongst individual YMCA societies. This marked the beginning of the World Alliance of YMCAs. The conference adopted the [[Paris Basis]], a common mission for all present and future national YMCAs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=115 |title=Paris Basis |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> Its motto was taken from the Bible, \"[[That they all may be one]]\" ([[John 17]]:21).\n\nOther ecumenical bodies, such as the World [[YWCA]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] have reflected elements of the Paris Basis in their founding mission statements. In 1865, the Fourth World Conference of YMCAs, held in Germany, affirmed the importance of developing the whole individual in spirit, mind, and body. The concept of physical work through sports, a new concept for the time, was also recognized as part of this \"[[muscular Christianity]]\".\n\nTwo themes resonated during the council: the need to respect the local autonomy of YMCA societies, and the purpose of YMCA: to unite all young, male Christians for the extension and expansion of the Kingdom of God. The former idea is expressed in the preamble:\n\n{{quote|The delegates of various Young Men's Christian Associations of Europe and America, assembled in Conference at Paris, the 22 August 1855 feeling that they are one in principle and in operation, recommend to their respective Societies to recognize with them the unity existing among their Associations, and while preserving a complete independence as to their particular organization and modes of action, to form a Confederation of secession on the following fundamental principle, such principle to be regarded as the basis of admission of other Societies in future.}}\n\n=== 1870s to 1910s ===\n[[File:KINO YMCA.JPG|thumb|YMCA building in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia]]\n\nYMCA was very influential during the 1870s and the 1930s, during which times it most successfully promoted \"evangelical Christianity in weekday and Sunday services, while promoting good sportsmanship in athletic contests in gyms (where [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] were invented) and swimming pools.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>  Later in this period, and continuing on through the 20th century, YMCA had \"become interdenominational and more concerned with promoting morality and good citizenship than a distinctive interpretation of Christianity.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>[[File:Geneve archives YMCA 2011-08-23 11 24 53 PICT4048.JPG|thumb|left|Logo of the World Alliance of YMCAs (YMCA Archive, Geneva)]]\n\nIn 1878, the World YMCA offices were established in [[Geneva]], Switzerland by Dunant. Later, in 1900, North American YMCAs, in collaboration with the World YMCA, set up centres to work with emigrants in European ports, as millions of people were leaving for the USA. In 1880, YMCA became the first national organization to adopt a strict policy of equal gender representation in committees and national boards, with Norway being the country that first adopted it.\n\nIn 1885, Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley), the first residential camp in the United States and North America, was established by George A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley, both of whom worked for YMCA.

T. Paul]] became the first Indian national general secretary of India. Paul had started rural development programs for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. He also coined the term \"rural reconstruction\", and many of the principles he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community development programs. In 1923, [[Y. C. James Yen]], of YMCA China, devised the \"thousand character system\", based on pilot projects in education. The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement.

In 1985 the World Council of YMCAs passed a resolution against [[apartheid]], and anti-apartheid campaigns were formed under the leadership of Lee Soo-Min ([[Korea]]), the first Asian secretary general of the World YMCA.\n\n==== Challenge 21 and recent years ====\n[[File:YMCAUB.JPG|thumb|YMCA in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia]]\n\nIn 1998 the 14th World Council of YMCAs in Germany adopted \"Challenge 21\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.int/who-we-are/mission/challenge-21-1998/|title=Challenge 21 - 1998|website=YMCA International - World Alliance of YMCAs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> intended to place more focus on global challenges, such as [[gender equality]], [[sustainable development]], war and peace, fair distribution, and the challenges of [[globalization]], racism, and HIV/AIDS.\n\n{{quote|Affirming the Paris Basis adopted in 1855, as the ongoing foundation statement of the mission of YMCA, at the threshold of the third millennium, we declare that YMCA is a worldwide Christian, ecumenical, voluntary movement for women and men with special emphasis on and the genuine involvement of young people and that it seeks to share the Christian ideal of building a human community of justice with love, peace and reconciliation for the fullness of life for all creation.\n\nEach member YMCA is therefore called to focus on certain challenges which will be prioritized according to its own context.\n\nThese principles are an evolution of the Kampala Principles <!-- sic: original has no colon or other punctuation here -->\n* Sharing the good news of Jesus Christ and striving for spiritual, intellectual and physical well-being of individuals and wholeness of communities.\n* Empowering all to take increased responsibilities and assume leadership at all levels and working towards an equitable society.\n* Advocating for and promoting the rights of and upholding the rights of children.\n* Fostering dialogue and partnership between people of different faiths and ideologies and recognizing the cultural identities of people and promoting cultural renewal.\n* Committing to work in solidarity with the poor, dispossessed, uprooted people and oppressed racial, religious and ethnic minorities.\n* Seeking to be mediators and reconciles in situations of conflict and working for meaningful participation and advancement of people for their own self-determination.\n* Defending God's creation against all that would destroy it and preserving and protecting the earth's resources for coming generations.

The national organizations, in turn, are affiliated to both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World YMCA. The World YMCA is the highest affiliation body. Each local, national and regional YMCA is independent of each other, but local, regional and international cooperation, partnerships and collaborations are part of the organizations work. Each National Council is led by a National General Secretary, a role that is akin to that of a CEO.\n\nEver since the first World Conference in August 1855, in Paris, the World YMCA has convened a World Conference (later named World Council) every three to four years and is YMCA's highest decision making forum. Every National Council sends a delegation who hold a number of votes, which are dependent on the financial turnover of that National Council. The World Council is \u201cresponsible for setting the policies and direction of the World YMCA, electing its Officers and Executive Committee, evaluating the work of the last four years, and deliberating on priorities for the next quadrennium\".

The circular emblem is made up of five segments, one for each continent. The segments are held together by small monograms of YMCA in different languages. As early as 1881, YMCA leaders believed the Movement could be truly international and united across borders. In the center is a larger monogram of X and P, [[Chi Rho|Chi and Rho]], Christ's name, as used by early Christians. An open Bible sits on top of the monogram, showing [[That they all may be one|John XVII, Verse 21, \"that they all may be one\"]]. This was to remind YMCAs that Christ is at the center of the Movement, a source of strength, hope and unity, binding them all together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ymca.int/about-us/ymca-history/ymca-logo-history/|title=YMCA Logo - History|website=World YMCA}}</ref>\n\nIn 1891 [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], a physical education director at YMCA of the USA, introduced a new emblem to represent YMCA, an inverted red triangle. Each of the triangle's sides represented 'the whole man' and a different aspect of YMCA's work as recognised by Gulick; Mind, Body and Spirit.<ref>https://infed.org/mobi/luther-halsey-gulick-recreation-physical-education-and-the-ymca/</ref> So significant was the red triangle, it would go on to become a familiar symbol of YMCA's work on the home front and around the world during WW1 and WW2. The red triangle is still used as part of many local, national and regional YMCA logos today.\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Accommodation ===\nYMCAs around the world offer various types of accommodation. In some places this takes the form of budget accommodation available to the public such as youth hostels, or hotels which in turn generate income for other charitable activities. In England and Wales, YMCAs offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people.<ref name=\"Accommodation\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/accommodation|title=Accommodation|website=YMCA England & Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Education and Academia ===\n\nMultiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to YMCA. [[Springfield College]], of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]\u2014[[Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams College]]\u2014started from night courses offered at the [[Montreal]] YMCA. [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] began out of a [[Boston YMCA|YMCA in Boston]], and [[Franklin University]] began as YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's [[Golden Gate University]] traces its roots to the founding of YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. [[Detroit College of Law]], now the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. [[Youngstown State University]] traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The [[Nashville School of Law]] was YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of [[Juris Doctor]] since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of [[wikt:night school|night school]], providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer [[English as a second language|ESL]] programs, [[alternative high school]], [[day care]], and [[summer camp]] programs. In India, [[YMCA University of Science and Technology]] [[Faridabad]] was founded in 1969. It offers various program-related to science and engineering.\n\nAmerican high school students have a chance to participate in [[YMCA Youth and Government]], wherein clubs of children representing each YMCA community convene annually in their respective [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to \"take over the State Capitol for a day.\"\n\nAmerican students in [[Title One]] public schools are sometimes eligible to join a tutoring program through YMCA called Y Learning. This program is used to help low-income students who are struggling in school complete their homework with help from tutors and receive a snack as well as a safe place to be after school. Y Learning operates under the main mission of bridging achievements gaps and providing essential resources to help underprivileged students thrive in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymcatriangle.org/programs-services/tutoring/y-learning|title=Y Learning, standardized tutorial program {{!}} YMCA of the Triangle|website=www.ymcatriangle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe International Coalition of YMCA Universities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymcauniversitiescoalition.org/|title=Coalition YMCA Universities|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> brings together universities from all over the world, including Brazil, England, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela. The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.\n\n=== Health and Wellbeing ===\n[[File:YMCA Association Men Cover June 1919.png|thumbnail|right|YMCA ''Association Men'' cover, June 1919]]\n\nIn 1891 [[James Naismith]], a Canadian American, invented [[Basketball]] while studying at YMCA International Training School in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] (later to be named [[Springfield College]]). Naismith had been asked to invent a new game in an attempt to interest pupils in physical exercise. The game had to be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play indoors in winter. In 1895, [[William G. Morgan]] from YMCA of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], invented the sport of [[Volleyball]] as a slower paced alternative sport, in which the older YMCA members could participate. In 1930, {{illm|Juan Carlos Ceriani|fr|Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier}} from YMCA of [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, invented the sport of [[futsal]], an indoor version of [[Association football|football]], having been created in synthesis with the rules of the three indoor sports of [[American handball|handball]], basketball and [[water polo]].\n\n==== Public Health ====\nThe organization is committed to public health in different ways. It organizes fitness and wellness as well as help and awareness programs. One of the programs is the ''Diabetes Prevention Program'', where trained staff members help sick persons to make their lives healthy and active.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/at-a-ymca-near-you-a-course-for-a-diabetic-nation/|title=At a YMCA Near You, a Course for a Diabetic Nation|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|date=2014-07-03|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n====Basketball====\nBasketball was invented at YMCA, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a clergyman, educator and physician.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://eu.courierpress.com/story/life/2018/01/30/history-lesson-early-basketball-ymca/1077521001/\n | title =History Lesson: Early basketball at YMCA\n | last =Smith \n | first =Daniel\n | date =30 January 2018\n | website =Courier & Press\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 2 January 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> Naismith was asked to create an indoor \"athletic distraction\" to keep rowdy youth busy in the cold New England winter months. [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], the head of  Springfield YMCA, gave Naismith two weeks to come up with a game to occupy a particularly incorrigible group. Naismith decided the game had to be physically active, simple to understand and would have minimal physical roughness.\n\nThe original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to the balcony of Springfield YMCA. The game was an immediate hit, although originally the baskets still had their bottoms, and the ball had to be manually retrieved after each score, considerably slowing play. It was mostly a passing game, and dribbling did not become a major part of the game until much later, when the ball was improved to its present form.\n\nGulick worked with Naismith to spread the sport, chairing the Basketball Committee of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (1895\u20131905) and representing the [[United States Olympic Committee]] during the [[1908 Olympic Games]]. Naismith and his wife attended the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] when basketball was included for the first time as an Olympic event.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Book of the Olympics|last=Loucky, Wallechinsky|first=David and Jamie|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=399\u2013400}}</ref> For his efforts to increase the popularity of basketball and of [[physical fitness]] in general, Gulick was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a contributor in 1959.\n\n====Volleyball====\nFour years after James Naismith invented basketball in Springfield in 1891, [[William G. Morgan]], an instructor at YMCA in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], wanted to create a game for older gentlemen which had less physical contact. He borrowed a tennis net, raised it 6 feet, 6 inches above the floor, and invented the game of \"mintonette\", which could be played by a group of any number and involved volleying a large ball over the net. An observer wisely suggested that a better name for the new sport might be \"volleyball\".\n\n====Racquetball====\nRacquetball is another YMCA invented sport. [[Joseph Sobek]] a tennis, handball and squash player who worked in a rubber manufacturing factory, was dissatisfied with the options for indoor sports in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He could not find squash players of his caliber and he did not care particularly for handball, so in 1950 he designed a short, stringed racquet, used a children's toy rubber ball, and created rules for a new game using the handball courts. He called his new sport \"paddle rackets\". The sport really took off in the 1970s and there are an estimated 15&nbsp;million players worldwide today.<ref>\"Popular sports invented at YMCA\" by Jill Fandrich, 25 May 2009</ref>\n\n=== Publishing ===\n{{Main|YMCA Press}} YMCA founded YMCA Press [[publishing house]] in Russia in 1900. It moved to Paris after [[World War I]], where it focused on providing intellectual and educational works to Russian [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s. It perhaps most famously published some of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s books whilst he was imprisoned by the Russian government.<ref name=\"Raeff1990\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/russiaabroadcult00raef_0|url-access=registration|title=Russia Abroad: A Cultural History of the Russian Emigration, 1919-1939|author=Marc Raeff|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-19-505683-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/russiaabroadcult00raef_0/page/78 78]}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious ===\n[[File:YMCA Maple Syrup.JPG|thumb|Campers at a YMCA camp in Huguenot]]\n\nThe first YMCA included Bible studies, although the organization has generally moved on to a more [[holistic]] approach to youth work. Around six years after its birth, an international YMCA conference in Paris decided that the objective of the organization should become \"[[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian discipleship]] developed through a program of religious, educational, social and physical activities\" (Binfield 1973:265).\n\n== Europe ==\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nYMCAs in England and Wales offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people, mental health services, youth clubs, sports centres, nursery schools and family support and after school clubs. Across England and Wales YMCA supports more than 18,000 young people with homes each year,<ref name=\"Accommodation\"/> and is thus one of the largest providers of safe supported accommodation for young people. The vast majority of this accommodation is supported by a range of personal, social and educational services.\n\nThe archive of the British YMCA is housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections. The archive of YMCA Scotland is available at the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. YMCA in the United Kingdom consists of three separate National Councils: England & Wales, Ireland, and [[Scotland]]. YMCAs in [[Wales]] joined YMCA England in 2017, leading to the National Council renaming to YMCA England & Wales.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:CVJM Wittenberg 04.jpg|thumb|CVJM building in [[Wittenberg]]]]\nIn Germany (as well as Austria and Switzerland) YMCA is called CVJM, which stands for Christlicher Verein junger Menschen (Christian Association of Young People). Up until 1985 the organisation was called \u2018Christlicher Verein Junger M\u00e4nner\u2019 (Christian Association of Young Men), the name change reflected its activities being accessible to men and women.\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThe [[YWCA-YMCA of Sweden]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''KFUK-KFUM Sverige''''') was established in 1966 following a merger of the YMCA of Sweden and the YWCA of Sweden. In 2011, the organization decided to use the term '''''KFUM Sverige''''' during promotion where ''M'' now stands for ''m\u00e4nniskor'' (\"people\") instead of ''m\u00e4n'' (men) as before. The YWCA-YMCA of Sweden has 40,000 members in 140 local associations. Several Swedish YWCA-YMCA associations have been successful in sport.\n\n== North America ==\n\n{{Anchor|YMCA of the USA}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Advert section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Ymca logo 2011-06-28.png|thumb|right|International ''(above)'' and American ''(below)'' logos]]\n[[File:Ketchum Downtown YMCA, Front View.jpg|thumb|right|Ketchum Downtown YMCA of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

By 1904, there were two more branches in Mexico City and one branch established in Monterrey. In 1907, another branch in Chihuahua was set up and then one YMCA in Tampico. In Mexico, the YMCA organized physical activity, individual development, and national progress. There was advertising for YMCA programs that would help young men gain life skills and YMCA also had some activities for women. For example, an excursion to Xochimilco in 1910 featured races for boys and girls and indoor baseball for everyone. Although, the YMCA had very little influence on rural Mexico until after the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Elsey|first=Brenda|title=Futbolera|last2=Nadel|first2=Joshua|publisher=University of Texas Press|date=May 21, 2019|isbn=978-1477310427|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== First century ====\nThe first YMCA in North America opened in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, on 9 December 1851.\n\nThe first YMCA in the United States opened on 29 December 1851, in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1851 by Captain Thomas Valentine Sullivan (1800\u201359), an American seaman and missionary. He was influenced by the London YMCA and saw the association as an opportunity to provide a \"home away from home\" for young sailors on shore leave. The [[Boston YMCA|Boston chapter]] promoted evangelical Christianity, the cultivation of Christian sympathy, and the improvement of the spiritual, physical, and mental condition of young men. By 1853, the Boston YMCA had 1,500 members, most of whom were merchants and artisans. Hardware merchant [[Franklin W. Smith]] was the first elected president in 1855.<ref name=\"BORDER\">Howell, Benita J.: [http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf \"Franklin Webster Smith of Boston: Architect of Tourism in Busby, Tennessee\"] Border States: Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, 2003</ref>\nMembers paid an annual membership fee to use the facilities and services of the association. Because of political, physical, and population changes in Boston during the second half of the century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs of local neighborhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational classes. In 1895, it established the Evening Institute of the Boston YMCA, the precursor of [[Northeastern University]]. From 1899 to 1968, the association established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 31 branches and centers. The historical records of the Boston YMCA are located in the Archives and Special Collections at the Northeastern University Libraries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m13find.htm |title=Young Men's Christian Association of Greater Boston records |publisher=Library.neu.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], had its first YMCA in 1852, a few blocks west of Charles Street with later an extensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style triangular structure of brick with limestone trim with two towers at the northwest and southwest ends and two smaller cupolas in the center, built by 1872\u201373 on the northwest corner of West Saratoga and [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles Streets]], the former site of the city's first Roman Catholic church (St. Peter's, 1770) and pro-cathedral (1791\u20131826), but razed in 1841. The first central Baltimore YMCA, which still stands in 2014 (but with its towers removed in the early 1900s, converted to offices in the 1910s and apartments and condos in 2001) at the northern edge of the downtown business district near Cathedral Hill and the more toney residential [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal]] neighborhood with many of the city's cultural and educational institutions relocating. By 1907, three blocks further north, a cornerstone was laid for a [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts/Classical Revival]] styled, seven-story building on the northeast corner of West Franklin at Cathedral Streets, across the street to the north from the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] (the old Baltimore Cathedral) of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1806\u201321). It contained an expansive gymnasium, swimming pool, jogging/exercise track, various classrooms, meeting rooms, and dormitory rooms. Two decades later, the city's central branch of the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] public circulating library system (first of its kind in America) expanded from its original \"Old Central\" a block south facing West Mulberry Street to a new block-long library facing Cathedral Street and the Cathedral/Basilica in 1931\u20131933, with distinctive department store front display windows on the sidewalk, giving the area a unique cultural and educational centrality. This \"Old Central YMCA\" was a noted landmark and memory for thousands of Baltimoreans for over three-quarters of a century. It later was converted to the present Mount Vernon Hotel and Caf\u00e9 as the Baltimore area's Central YMCA of central Maryland reorganized in the early 1980s and cut back on its various activities in the downtown area to more suburban and neighborhood centers throughout the region (although not without controversy and some alienation as the \"Old Central\" was closed). Additional YMCA work was undertaken in what was then called the \"Colored YMCA\" in the inner northwest neighborhood of [[Upton, Baltimore|Upton]] on [[Maryland Route 127|Druid Hill Avenue]] near the traditional \"Black\" Pennsylvania Avenue commercial/cultural district which were undertaken by committed then \"Negro/Colored\" residents, who persevered in the early 20th century despite very little encouragement and hardly any financial resources from the board of the Central YMCA of Baltimore.\n\nIn 1853 the Reverend [[Anthony Bowen]] founded the first YMCA for Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA is still serving the U Street area of Washington. It became a part of YMCA of the city of Washington in 1947.\n\nYMCA developed the first known English as a Second Language program in the United States in response to the influx of immigrants in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcagbc.org/about-y/y|title=The Y|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nStarting before the [[American Civil War]],<ref name=YMCAhistory/> YMCA provided nursing, shelter, and other support in wartime.\n\nIn 1879 Darren Blach organized the first [[Sioux]] Indian YMCA in Florida. Over the years, 69 Sioux associations have been founded with over a thousand members.

It deployed over 25,000 staff in military units and bases from Siberia to Egypt to France. They took over the military's morale and comfort operations worldwide. [[Irving Berlin]] wrote ''[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]'', a revue that included a song entitled \"I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA\".

YMCA secretaries worked to create camp committees to run programs providing educational opportunities, physical instruction, and equipment, theatrical productions and musicals. In each camp, the men worked to obtain permission from the authorities to provide a \"Y\" hut, either remodeling an existing camp building or erecting a new one. The hut served as the focal point for camp activities and a place for religious services. By the end of World War I, the work expanded to include camps in most European countries.\n\n==== Since World War II ====\n\nYMCA was associated with homosexual subculture through the middle part of the 20th century, with the athletic facilities providing cover for closeted individuals.<ref>Neumann, Caryn E. glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture.

Notable founders of YMCA Indian Guides include Harold Keltner, the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] YMCA secretary, and Joe Friday, an Ojibway hunting guide. The two men met in 1927, when Keltner went on a hunting and fishing trip in the Hudson Bay country. With Friday's help, Keltner studied the close companionship of Ojibway boys and their fathers. This is when he conceived the plan for the Indian Guides.<ref>(From a newspaper article dated 9 November 1937) http://vintagekidstuff.com/yguides/imgB5.jpg</ref> Today, Joe Friday and Harold Keltner are commemorated with patch awards honoring their legacy.
