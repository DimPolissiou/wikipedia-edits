In {{bibleverse|1 Kings|18|9}}, Elijah defended the worship of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]] over that of the Canaanite deity [[Baal]]. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including [[resurrection]] (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and [[entering Heaven alive]] \"by fire\".<ref>[[2 Kings 2:11]]</ref> He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\".<ref>{{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3|9}}</ref> Following his ascension, [[Elisha]], his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school.

He appears in numerous stories and references in the [[Haggadah]] and [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]].\n\nThe Christian [[New Testament]] notes that some people thought that [[Jesus]] was, in some sense, Elijah,<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|16:14|NIV}} & {{bibleref2|Mark|8:28|NIV}}.</ref> but it also makes clear that [[John the Baptist]] is \"the Elijah\" who was promised to come in [[Malachi 3:1]]; [[Malachi 4:5|4:5]].<ref>For John the Baptist as Elijah, see {{bibleref2|Luke|1:11\u201317|NIV}} & {{bibleref2|Matthew|11:14;17:10\u201313|NIV}}.</ref> According to accounts in all three of the [[Synoptic Gospels]], Elijah appeared with [[Moses]] during the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].\n\nIn Islam, Elijah appears in the Quran as a [[prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet and messenger of God]], where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of [[Baal]] is recounted in a concise form.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tottoli |first=Roberto|editor1=Jane Dammen McAuliffe |date=2002 |title=Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n|volume=Two|chapter=Elijah |url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfTheQuranVol.2eI |location=Boston |publisher=Brill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfTheQuranVol.2eI/page/n15 12]\u201313 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Due to his importance to Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians, Elijah has been venerated as the [[patron saint]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] since 1752.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vecernji.ba/vijesti/sveti-ilija-zastitnik-bosne-hercegovine-clanak-433510 |title=Sveti Ilija - za\u0161titnik Bosne i Hercegovine |publisher=vecernji.ba  |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2013|language=hr}}</ref>\n\n== Biblical accounts ==\n[[File:Kingdoms of Israel and Judah map 830.svg|thumb|Map of [[Israel]] as it was in the 9th century [[Before Christ|BC]].

[[Baal]] was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.\nElijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:17-19|NRSV}}</ref>\n\n==== Widow of Zarephath ====\n{{main|Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath}}\n[[File:ElijahByLouisHersent.JPG|thumb|''Elijah reviving the Son of the Widow of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]]'' by [[Louis Hersent]]]]\nAfter Elijah's confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook [[Chorath]], east of the [[Jordan river|Jordan]], where he will be fed by [[Cultural depictions of ravens|raven]]s.<ref>1 Kings 17; {{cite web|title= The Peraea and the Dead Sea|url= http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|publisher= The Madaba Mosaic Map|accessdate= 13 October 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182851/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|archive-date= 27 July 2011|url-status= dead}}</ref> When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]] in [[Phoenicia]]. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid...For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.\"<ref>1 Kings 17:13, 14, ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her \"[[manna]]\" from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:18|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''.</ref> Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God \"listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\"<ref>''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, \"the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:24|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version.''</ref>\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets [[Obadiah (1 Kings)|Obadiah]], the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel's violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah's whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.\n\n==== Challenge to Baal ====\n[[File:Elijahwindow.jpg|thumb|Elijah's offering is consumed by fire from heaven in a stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]\n\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the \"troubler of Israel\" but Elijah takes notice of his [[hypocrisy]] and tells Ahab that he is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of [[false god]]s. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:21|NRSV}}</ref> And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, \"go limping\" or \"waver\", is the same as that used for \"danced\" in 1 Kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of Israel.\n\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of [[Asherah]] are summoned to [[Mount Carmel]]. An altar is built for Baal. Wood is laid on the altar. An ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Kings|18:27|NRSV}}</ref> They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.\n\nElijah builds an altar from twelve stones, digs a huge trench around it, lays wood on it, slaughters another ox, cuts it up, and lays it on the wood. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times, filling also the trench.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:33\u201334|NIV}}</ref> He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. Elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\n\n==== Mount Horeb ====\n[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201313|HE}}</ref> Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to [[Beersheba]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the [[angel of the Lord]] touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.\n\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to [[Mount Horeb]],<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Elijah |volume=9 |pages=273\u2013274 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Stanley Arthur |last2=Cook}}</ref> where [[Moses]] had received the [[Ten Commandments]]. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a [[Cave of Elijah|cave]]. God again speaks to Elijah:<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}</ref> \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\". Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the \"only one left\". Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and \"stand before the Lord.\" A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a \"still small voice\" comes to Elijah and asks again, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. God then sends him out again, this time to [[Damascus]] to anoint [[Hazael]] as king of [[Aram-Damascus|Aram]], [[Jehu]] as king of [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] as his replacement.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:JPF-Cave Of Elijah.JPG|A statue of Elijah in the Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\nFile:Elijah's cave P3160005.JPG|The Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\n</gallery>\n\n==== Vineyard of Naboth ====\nElijah encounters Ahab again in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21|HE}}, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of [[Naboth]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\n\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you killed, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|21:19|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]].\n\n==== Ahaziah ====\n[[File:094.Elijah Destroys the Messengers of Ahaziah.jpg|thumb|Elijah destroying the messengers of Ahaziah (illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] ([[2 Kings 1]]). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of [[Beelzebub|Baalzebub]] in [[Ekron]], outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\"<ref name=EB1911/><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:6|NRSV}}</ref> Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\n\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.<ref>[[2 Kings 1:17]]</ref>\n\n==== Departure ====\n[[File:Elijah Departure and Elisha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Elijah Departure and Elisha, Russian Orthodox icon of 17th century]]\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3\u20139|HE}}, [[Elisha]] (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\n\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his [[mantle (vesture)|mantle]] and strikes the water.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}</ref> The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear<ref name=EB1911/> and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\n\n=== Final mention: 2nd Chronicles ===\nElijah is mentioned once more in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|21:12|HE}}, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to [[Jehoram of Judah]]. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of [[YHVH]] the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind. Michael Wilcock, formerly of [[Trinity College, Bristol]], suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet.<ref>Myers, J. M. ''The Anchor Bible: II Chronicles.'' Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, 1965. pp. 121\u201323.</ref> [[John Van Seters]], however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition.<ref>VanSeters, John. \"Elijah.\" In Jones, Lindsay.

A fresco from [[Rila Monastery]], Bulgaria, medieval [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition, renovated 20th century]]\nAccording to Susanne Otto, the Elijah stories were added to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] in four stages. The first stage dates from the final edition of the History, about 560 BC, when the three stories of [[Naboth]]'s vineyard, the death of [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], and the story of [[Jehu]]'s coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of God's word and the cycle of Baal worship and religious reform in the history of the Northern Kingdom. The narratives about the [[Omri]]de wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards God determines the fate of Israel. According to Otto, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17\u201318|HE}} was added in early post-Exilic times (after 538 BC) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with God after the time of judgment. Additionally, Otto suggests that in the fifth century BC, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201318|HE}} and the remaining [[Elisha]] stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of Israel. The foregoing Otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars.<ref name=otto>\n{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Susanne |url=http://jot.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/487 |title=Susanne Otto, \"The Composition of the Elijah-Elisha Stories and the Deuteronomistic History\"|journal=Journal for the Study of the Old Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508 |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}(Online Abstract)</ref>\n\n== In the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books ==\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the [[aggadah]], which is found throughout various collections of [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death{{snd}} or \"translation\"{{snd}} ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\n\nFrom the time of [[Malachi]], who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\" ([[Malachi 4:5|Malachi 3:23 in Hebrew Bible]]), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\n\n=== Origin ===\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,<ref>Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi.</ref>\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|8:27|HE}}, and\n(3) he was a priest.\n\nMany Christian Church fathers also<ref>Aphraates, \"Homilies,\" ed. Wright, p.&nbsp;314; Epiphanius, \"H\u00e6res.\" lv. 3, passim</ref> have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some Rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with [[Phinehas]].<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xlvii.; Targ. Yer. on Num. xxv. 12</ref>\n\nAccording to later [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature, Elijah was really an [[angel]] in human form,<ref name=EB1911/> so that he had neither parents nor offspring.<ref>Yal\u1e33u\u1e6d Reubeni, Bereshit, 9a, ed. Amsterdam</ref>\n\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\n\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"<ref>Baba Metzia 14B</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's zeal for God ===\n[[File:Statue of Saint Elijah at Saint Elijah Maronite Cathedral, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of Elijah at the [[Saint Elias Cathedral]], [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nIn spite of Elijah's many miracles, the mass of the Jewish people remained as godless as before. A [[midrash]]{{which|date=February 2019}} tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxix.</ref>\n\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.<ref>Tanna debe Eliyahu Zu\u1e6da viii.</ref>\n\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds.\" This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.<ref>Tan., Pe\u1e33ude, p.&nbsp;128, Vienna ed.</ref>\n\nThree years after this vision, Elijah was \"translated.\"<ref>Seder 'Olam R. xvii.</ref> Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.<ref>\u1e32id. 70; Ber. R. xxxiv. 8</ref>\n\nBut as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper.<ref>Suk. 5a</ref> In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah,<ref>Compare Pir\u1e33e R. El. xvi.</ref> but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.\n\n=== Ecclesiasticus ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"At the appointed time, it is written, you are destined<br />\nto calm the wrath of God before it breaks out in fury,<br />\nto turn the hearts of parents to their children,<br />\nand to restore the tribes of Jacob.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2014 A line in [[Ecclesiasticus]] describing Elijah's mission (Ecclesiasticus 48:10).\n|}\nIn the [[Ben Sira|Wisdom of Jesus ben Sira]] ({{Bibleverse||Sirach|48:10|NRSV}}) his tasks are altered to: 1) herald the eschaton, 2) calm God's fury, 3) restore familial peace, and 4) restore the 12 tribes.\n\n== Elijah in Judaism ==\n=== Elijah's chair ===\n{{See also|Brit milah}}\n[[File:Chair of Elijah.JPG|thumb|\"Chair of Elijah\" used during the [[brit milah]] (circumcision) ceremony. The [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] inscription reads \"This is the chair of Elijah, remembered for Good.\"]]\n\nAt Jewish [[Brit milah|circumcision]] ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a [[witness]] at all circumcisions when the sign of the [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19|HE}}): Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on [[Mount Carmel]]. ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18|HE}}) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\" ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:10|HE}}). According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:18|HE}}), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.<ref>\"Elijah, Chair of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref><ref>Unterman, Alan. \"Elijah's Chair.\" ''Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1991.</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's cup ===\n{{See also|Passover Seder}}\nIn the [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]], Elijah would visit [[rabbis]] to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the [[Jewish Eschatology|eschaton]]. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes.\"<ref>\"Elijah, Cup of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref>\n\nOne such decision was whether the [[Passover Seder]] required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the [[Book of Exodus]]:\n\n<blockquote>I am the Lord, and ''I will bring you out'' from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and ''I will deliver you'' from their bondage, and ''I will redeem you'' with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and ''I will take you'' for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}).</blockquote>\n\nThe next verse, \"And ''I will bring you'' into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:8|HE}}) was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\n\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.<ref name=\" Temple\">Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish Literacy.''

As part of the concluding [[hymn]], an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\n== Elijah in Jewish folklore ==\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 580.</ref> ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:25|HE}}). Because of Phinehas' zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, \"a covenant of lasting priesthood\" ({{Bibleverse||Numbers|25:13|HE}}). Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel [[Sandalphon]],<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Jewish Philadelphia: Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 589</ref> whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. pp. 590\u201391.</ref> Yet another name for Elijah is \"Angel of the Covenant\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 201.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ===\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood)<ref>Bialik, H. N. and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki|Y. H Ravnitzky]]. eds. ''The Book of Legends: Sefer Ha-Aggadah.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1992. pp. 756, 782, 805.</ref> to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\n\nOne such story is that of Rabbi [[Joshua ben Levi]]. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.\n\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 599.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Eliezer ===\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai|Simon ben Yohai]] is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 597.</ref>\n\n=== Lilith ===\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of [[Lilith]]. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956.</ref>\n\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.\n\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 224\u201325.</ref>\n\n== Elijah in Christianity ==\n=== References in the New Testament ===\n[[File:Intesa elijah.jpg|thumb|A Northern Russian icon from ca. 1290 showing the ascent of Elijah toward heaven]]\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] would say for those who believed, [[John the Baptist]] was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by [[Malachi]].\n\nSome English translations of the New Testament use [[Elias]], a Latin form of the name. In the [[King James Version]], \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\n\n==== John the Baptist ====\n[[John the Baptist]] preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ([[Matthew 3:4]], {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:6|9}}). He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\n\nIn the [[Gospel of John]], when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\" ({{Bibleverse||John|1:21|9}}). {{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:10\u201313|9}} however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]] in Luke, [[Gabriel]] appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah\" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|9}}).\n\n==== Jesus Christ ====\n[[File:Transfigurationbloch.jpg|thumb|right|Elijah appeared at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].]]\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Herod Antipas]] hears some of the stories surrounding [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Some tell Herod that Jesus is John the Baptist (whom Herod had executed) come back to life. Others tell him that Jesus is Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:7\u20139|9}} also {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:14\u201316|9}}</ref> Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:18\u201319|9}}, also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|16:13\u201316|9}}</ref>\n\nHowever Jesus' ministry had little in common with that of Elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while Elijah killed his. [[Miracle]] stories similar to those of Elijah were associated with Jesus (''e.g.'', raising of the dead,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Mark|5:21\u201343|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|7:11\u201315|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|8:49\u201356|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|11|9}}</ref> miraculous feeding).<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:13\u201321|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:34\u201345|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:10\u201317|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|6:5\u201316|9}}; also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:29\u201338|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Mark|8:1\u20139|9}}</ref> Jesus implicitly separates himself from Elijah when he rebukes James and John for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming Samaritan village in a similar manner to Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:51\u201356|9}}</ref> Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:61\u201362|9}}, {{Bibleverse||1 Kings|19:16\u201321|9}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]], some of the onlookers wonder if Elijah will come to rescue him,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:46\u201349|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:35\u201336|9}}</ref> as by the time of Jesus, Elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of Jews in distress.\n\n==== Transfiguration ====\nElijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:1\u201313|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|9:2\u201313|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:28\u201336|9}}</ref>\n\nAt the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus' face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son.\" The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.<!-- I know that there has been a tabernacle built, I just need to find a source. -->\n\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus (John 4:19) \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced [[Son of God]].<ref>Albright, W.

In {{Bibleverse||Luke|4:24\u201327|9}}, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets.

In {{Bibleverse||Romans|11:1\u20136|9}}, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:35|9}} (\"Women received their dead raised to life again...\") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha [[Raising of the son of the woman of Shunem|raising the son of the woman of Shunem]], citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith.<ref name=\"HebrewsGill\">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=John |title=Hebrews 11:35 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/hebrews-11-35.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsHenry\">{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Hebrews 11 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/hebrews/11.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsJamieson\">{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Robert Jamieson, A.

In writing of St. [[Albert Avogadro|Albert]], Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist [[Daniel Papebroch]] stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly.  From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of [[Jean de Launoy]] and the [[Sorbonne]]. In November 1698, [[Pope Innocent XII]] ordered an end to the controversy.<ref>[http://carmelitenuns.com/Controversies_Oother_Orders.htm  \"Controversies with Other Orders\", The Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\"]</ref>\n\n==== Liturgical commemorations ====\n[[Image:Prophet-Elias-Grk-ikon.png|thumb|Elias on [[Mount Horeb]], as depicted in a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]]]\n\nSince most [[Eastern Churches]] either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, ''Elias'' (or its modern [[iotacism|iotacized]] form ''Ilias'') is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]].\n\nThe [[feast day]] of [[saint]] Elias falls on July 20 of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|Orthodox liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 20 currently falls on August 2 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\n\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nThe [[Apolytikion]] in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>The incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Kontakion]] in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>O Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.</blockquote>\n\n==== {{anchor|Helios}}Pagan associations and mountaintops ====\n{{See also|Peryn#The cult of Peroun in Peryn and in Novgorod}}\n\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with [[Helios]], the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ([[2 Kings 2:11]]) just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust sacrifice]] offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}) corresponds to the sun warming the earth.<ref>J.

Since Wachsmuth (1864),<ref>C. Wachsmuth, ''Das alte Griechenland im neuen'', 1864, p. 23, cited by Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'', 1907, p. 174</ref> the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias.<ref>Delehaye, p. 174</ref> The modern folklore is not good evidence for the ''origin'' of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops.<ref name=\"cook\"/> Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".<ref>F. Lenormant, ''Monographie de la voie sacr\u00e9e \u00c9leusinienne'', 1864, p. 452 as quoted by Delehaye, p. 174</ref>\n\nThe association of Elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with [[Zeus]], especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lighting, and wind. When Elias prevailed over the priests of [[Baal]], it was on [[Mount Carmel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}), which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on [[Mount Horeb]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:8|9}}). When Elias confronted [[Ahab]], he stopped the rains for three years ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|17:1-18:1|9}}).<ref name=\"cook\">[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', 1925, p. 178 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9iShet_ZtHAC&pg=PA178 Google Books]</ref>\n\nA map of mountain-cults of Zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to Elias, including [[Mount Olympus]], [[Mount Lykaion]], [[Mount Arachnaion]], and [[Mount Taleton]] on the mainland, and [[Mount Kenaion]], [[Mount Oche]], and [[Mount Kynados]] in the islands. Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.<ref name=\"cook\" />\n\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\n\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to [[Ljuboten]] on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as ''Aligjyn'' (\"Ali Day\"), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elsie |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAtQZ0vjf5gC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=%22Ali%20day%22%20Aligjyni&f=false |title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture |publisher=NYU Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0814722145 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ilia chariot.jpg|thumb|This common depiction of the prophet Elijah riding a flaming chariot across the sky resulted in [[syncretism|syncretistic]] folklore among the [[Slavs]] incorporating pre-Christian motifs in the beliefs and rites regarding him in [[Slavic culture]].]]\nAs Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted [[Slavic tribes]] likely found him an ideal analogy for [[Perun#Post-Christian Perun|Perun]], the supreme [[Slavic mythology#Pantheon|Slavic god]] of storms, thunder and lightning bolts.

He was a prophet of the desert, like John the Baptist, unlike our holy Prophet, who took part in, controlled, and guided all the affairs of his people. Both Ahab and Azariah were prone to lapse into the worship of Baal, the sun-god worshipped in Syria. That worship also included the worship of nature-powers and procreative powers, as in the Hindu worship of the Lingam, and led to many abuses.

The Quran states, \"Verily Elijah was one of the apostles. When he said to his people: \"Will you not fear [[Allah|God]]? \"Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your {{LORD}} and Cherisher and the {{LORD}} and Cherisher of your fathers of old?\" [[As-Saaffat]] 123\u2013126<ref>{{Cite quran|37|123|e=126|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran makes it clear that the majority of Elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry.

He is believed to have been a \"prophet of the desert\u2014like [[John the Baptist]]\".<ref>Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, Commentary'', ''Note on Elijah''</ref> Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife [[Jezebel]], who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of [[False god|false idols]] in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of [[God]] to Israel after him.<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, ''Stories of Elias and Elisha''</ref>\n\nElijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr, and in one legend, with [[Muhammad]] himself.<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Elijah'': \"Muslim exegetes report that the prophet Muhammad and a band of followers once met Elijah on a journey outside Mecca. Elijah served the prophet with food from heaven and then left on a cloud heading for the heavens\"</ref> In [[Islamic]] [[mysticism]], Elijah is associated closely with the sage [[Khidr]]. One hadith reported that Elijah and [[Khidr]] met together every year in [[Jerusalem]] to go on the [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Elijah'': \"It is reported by Ibn Kathir that every year during the month of [[Ramadan]] in [[Jerusalem]], the prophets Elijah and [[Khidr]] meet...\"</ref> Elijah appears also in the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of [[Khidr]] as well as one who drank from the [[Fountain of Youth]].<ref>''The Adventures of Amir Hamza'', trans. M. A. Farooqi, cf. List of Characters: ''Ilyas'' or ''Prophet Elias''</ref>\n\nFurther, It is narrated in [[Kitab al-Kafi]] that Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] was reciting the prostration of Ilyas (Elijah) in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars: \n<blockquote><poem>\n\"O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?\" To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, \"Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you\".<ref name=\"Kulayni\">{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad ibn Ya\u2019qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}</ref>\n</blockquote></poem>\n\nAlthough most [[Muslim]] scholars believed that Elijah preached in [[Israel]], some early commentators on the [[Qur'an]] stated that Elijah was sent to [[Baalbek]], in [[Lebanon]].<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Elias and Elisha''</ref> Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of ''[[Baal]]'', which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping.

The Hebrew text at {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17:4\u20136|HE}} uses the word {{lang|he|\u05e2\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd}} ''`\u014drv\u012bm'', which means ''ravens'', but with a different vocalization might equally mean ''Arabs''. The [[Septuagint]] has {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}}, ''ravens'', and other traditional translations followed.\n\nAlternatives have been proposed for many years; for example [[Adam Clarke]] (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing.<ref>[[Adam Clarke|Clarke, Adam]]. The Holy Bible ... with a Commentary and Critical Notes, Volume II, London 1836</ref> Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean (see {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13\u201317|HE}}) as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.\n\nProf. John Gray chooses ''Arabs'', saying \"We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman.\"<ref>Gray, John. Old Testament Library, I & II Kings, SCM Press, London, 1964</ref> His translation of the verses in question is:\n\n<blockquote>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there. And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah and went and dwelt in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan. And the Arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.</blockquote>\n\n===Fire on Mount Carmel===\nThe challenge to the priests of Baal had the two-fold purpose of demonstrating that the God of Israel was greater than Baal, and that it was he who was the giver of rain.

Either the letter was written before he went to heaven and delivered by a messenger on earth (unlikely), or Elijah was \"caught away\" as was Philip from the Gaza Road to Azotas, (about 17 miles, Acts 8:39, 40) for an unspecified purpose and returned to the earth. Consider the evidence: 1. Elijah had been taken to heaven in a whirlwind. (2 Kings 2:11). 2. Elisha had taken over the duties of Elijah in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Kings 3:10, 11)., 3. Jehoram received a letter from Elijah, the prophet. (2 Chron. 21:1, 9\u201312). King Jehoram reigned after Jehoshaphat.

For many Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:9\u201313|9}}).

The oratorio chronicles many episodes of Elijah's life, including his challenge to Ahab and the contest of the gods, the miracle of raising the dead, and his ascension into heaven. Composed and premiered in 1846, the oratorio was criticized by members of the [[New German School]] but nonetheless remains one of the most popular Romantic choral-orchestral works in the repertoire.\n* In his ethnography ''[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape]'', anthropologist [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107] discusses the [[syncretic]] harvest feast of Elijah's Day (''Ilindan/Ali\u0111un''), shared by Christians and Muslims throughout [[Bosnia]].<ref>Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107, S.

Starting with a well-known Bosnian proverb about Elijah's two names \"Ilija until noon - Alija after noon\" (''Do podne Ilija, od podne Alija''), Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discusses the traditional and postwar waiting for Elijah, as well as the plethora of other characters he merges with (e.g. Slavic deity [[Perun]] and prophet [[Khidr]]). As the central trope in the book, the waiting for Elijah becomes the waiting for the restoration of home and cosmology after nationalist violence. The absence of Elijah is reminiscent of the one in Jewish rituals and Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discovers an imaginative form of political resistance in the waiting for Elijah's return. \n* In ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', the English knight [[Astolfo]] flies up to the moon in Elijah's flaming chariot.\n* [[Elijah Rock]] is a traditional Christian [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] about Elijah, also sometimes used by Jewish youth groups.\n* \"Go Like Elijah\" is a song by the American rock-pop-jazz songwriter [[Chi Coltrane]].\n* [[Lorenzetto]] created a statue of Elijah with assistance of the young sculptor [[Raffaello da Montelupo]], using designs by Raphael.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |title=Link to on-line biography of Lorenzetto from Vasari's '&#39;Vite'&#39; |publisher=Efn.org |accessdate=2014-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222204918/http://efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |archive-date=2009-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Fifth Mountain]]'' by [[Paulo Coelho]] is based on the story of Elijah.\n* Christian metal band [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]] released the song \"God of Elijah\" on their 2001 album [[By God]].

In {{bibleverse|1 Kings|18|9}}, Elijah defended the worship of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]] over that of the Canaanite deity [[Baal]]. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including [[resurrection]] (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and [[entering Heaven alive]] \"by fire\".<ref>[[2 Kings 2:11]]</ref> He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\".<ref>{{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3|9}}</ref> Following his ascension, [[Elisha]], his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school. The [[Book of Malachi]] prophesies Elijah's return \"before the coming of the great and terrible day of the {{Lord}}\",<ref>[[Malachi 4:5]]</ref> making him a harbinger of the [[Messiah]] and of the [[eschatology|eschaton]] in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible.

He appears in numerous stories and references in the [[Haggadah]] and [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]].\n\nThe Christian [[New Testament]] notes that some people thought that [[Jesus]] was, in some sense, Elijah,<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|16:14|NIV}} & {{bibleref2|Mark|8:28|NIV}}.</ref> but it also makes clear that [[John the Baptist]] is \"the Elijah\" who was promised to come in [[Malachi 3:1]]; [[Malachi 4:5|4:5]].<ref>For John the Baptist as Elijah, see {{bibleref2|Luke|1:11\u201317|NIV}} & {{bibleref2|Matthew|11:14;17:10\u201313|NIV}}.</ref> According to accounts in all three of the Synoptic Gospels, Elijah appeared with [[Moses]] during the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].\n\nIn Islam, Elijah appears in the Quran as a [[prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet and messenger of God]], where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of [[Baal]] is recounted in a concise form.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tottoli |first=Roberto|editor1=Jane Dammen McAuliffe |date=2002 |title=Encyclopaedia of the Qur\u02be\u0101n|volume=Two|chapter=Elijah |url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfTheQuranVol.2eI |location=Boston |publisher=Brill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfTheQuranVol.2eI/page/n15 12]\u201313 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Due to his importance to Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians, Elijah has been venerated as the [[patron saint]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] since 1752.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vecernji.ba/vijesti/sveti-ilija-zastitnik-bosne-hercegovine-clanak-433510 |title=Sveti Ilija - za\u0161titnik Bosne i Hercegovine |publisher=vecernji.ba  |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2013|language=hr}}</ref>\n\n== Biblical accounts ==\n[[File:Kingdoms of Israel and Judah map 830.svg|thumb|Map of [[Israel]] as it was in the 9th century [[Before Christ|BC]].

Ahab built a temple for Baal, and his wife Jezebel brought a large entourage of priests and prophets of Baal and [[Asherah]] into the country. In this context Elijah is introduced in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17:1|HE}} as Elijah \"the [[Tishbite]]\".

[[Baal]] was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.\nElijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:17-19|NRSV}}</ref>\n\n==== Widow of Zarephath ====\n{{main|Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath}}\n[[File:ElijahByLouisHersent.JPG|thumb|''Elijah reviving the Son of the Widow of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]]'' by [[Louis Hersent]]]]\nAfter Elijah's confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook [[Chorath]], east of the [[Jordan river|Jordan]], where he will be fed by [[Cultural depictions of ravens|raven]]s.<ref>1 Kings 17; {{cite web|title= The Peraea and the Dead Sea|url= http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|publisher= The Madaba Mosaic Map|accessdate= 13 October 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182851/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/sources/sources017.html|archive-date= 27 July 2011|url-status= dead}}</ref> When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]] in [[Phoenicia]]. When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid...For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.\"<ref>1 Kings 17:13, 14, ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her \"[[manna]]\" from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:18|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''.</ref> Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated. 1 Kings 17:22 relates how God \"listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\"<ref>''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, \"the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|17:24|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version.''</ref>\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets [[Obadiah (1 Kings)|Obadiah]], the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel's violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah's whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.\n\n==== Challenge to Baal ====\n[[File:Elijahwindow.jpg|thumb|Elijah's offering is consumed by fire from heaven in a stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]\n\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the \"troubler of Israel\" but Elijah takes notice of his [[hypocrisy]] and tells Ahab that he is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of [[false god]]s. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:21|NRSV}}</ref> And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, \"go limping\" or \"waver\", is the same as that used for \"danced\" in 1 Kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of Israel.\n\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of [[Asherah]] are summoned to [[Mount Carmel]]. An altar is built for Baal. Wood is laid on the altar. An ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\"<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Kings|18:27|NRSV}}</ref> They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.\n\nElijah builds an altar from twelve stones, digs a huge trench around it, lays wood on it, slaughters another ox, cuts it up, and lays it on the wood. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times, filling also the trench.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:33\u201334|NIV}}</ref> He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. Elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\n\n==== Mount Horeb ====\n[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201313|HE}}</ref> Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to [[Beersheba]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the [[angel of the Lord]] touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.\n\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to [[Mount Horeb]],<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Elijah |volume=9 |pages=273\u2013274 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Stanley Arthur |last2=Cook}}</ref> where [[Moses]] had received the [[Ten Commandments]]. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a [[Cave of Elijah|cave]]. God again speaks to Elijah:<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}</ref> \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\". Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the \"only one left\". Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and \"stand before the Lord.\" A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a \"still small voice\" comes to Elijah and asks again, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. God then sends him out again, this time to [[Damascus]] to anoint [[Hazael]] as king of [[Aram-Damascus|Aram]], [[Jehu]] as king of [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] as his replacement.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:JPF-Cave Of Elijah.JPG|A statue of Elijah in the Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\nFile:Elijah's cave P3160005.JPG|The Cave of Elijah, [[Mount Carmel]], Israel\n</gallery>\n\n==== Vineyard of Naboth ====\nElijah encounters Ahab again in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21|HE}}, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of [[Naboth]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\n\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you killed, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Kings|21:19|NRSV}} ''New Revised Standard Version''</ref> Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]].\n\n==== Ahaziah ====\n[[File:094.Elijah Destroys the Messengers of Ahaziah.jpg|thumb|Elijah destroying the messengers of Ahaziah (illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] from the 1866 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] ([[2 Kings 1]]). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of [[Beelzebub|Baalzebub]] in [[Ekron]], outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\"<ref name=EB1911/><ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:6|NRSV}}</ref> Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\n\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.<ref>[[2 Kings 1:17]]</ref>\n\n==== Departure ====\n[[File:Elijah Departure and Elisha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Elijah Departure and Elisha, Russian Orthodox icon of 17th century]]\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:3\u20139|HE}}, [[Elisha]] (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\n\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his [[mantle (vesture)|mantle]] and strikes the water.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}</ref> The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear<ref name=EB1911/> and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\n\n=== Final mention: 2nd Chronicles ===\nElijah is mentioned once more in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|21:12|HE}}, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to [[Jehoram of Judah]]. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of [[YHVH]] the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind. Michael Wilcock, formerly of [[Trinity College, Bristol]], suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet.<ref>Myers, J. M. ''The Anchor Bible: II Chronicles.''

A fresco from [[Rila Monastery]], Bulgaria, medieval [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition, renovated 20th century]]\nAccording to Susanne Otto, the Elijah stories were added to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] in four stages. The first stage dates from the final edition of the History, about 560 BC, when the three stories of [[Naboth]]'s vineyard, the death of [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], and the story of [[Jehu]]'s coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of God's word and the cycle of Baal worship and religious reform in the history of the Northern Kingdom. The narratives about the [[Omri]]de wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards God determines the fate of Israel. According to Otto, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17\u201318|HE}} was added in early post-Exilic times (after 538 BC) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with God after the time of judgment. Additionally, Otto suggests that in the fifth century BC, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1\u201318|HE}} and the remaining [[Elisha]] stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of Israel. The foregoing Otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars.<ref name=otto>\n{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Susanne |url=http://jot.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/487 |title=Susanne Otto, \"The Composition of the Elijah-Elisha Stories and the Deuteronomistic History\"|journal=Journal for the Study of the Old Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508 |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}(Online Abstract)</ref>\n\n== In the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books ==\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the [[aggadah]], which is found throughout various collections of [[rabbinic literature]], including the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death{{snd}} or \"translation\"{{snd}} ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\n\nFrom the time of [[Malachi]], who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\" ([[Malachi 4:5|Malachi 3:23 in Hebrew Bible]]), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\n\n=== Origin ===\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,<ref>Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi.</ref>\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|8:27|HE}}, and\n(3) he was a priest.\n\nMany Christian Church fathers also<ref>Aphraates, \"Homilies,\" ed. Wright, p.&nbsp;314; Epiphanius, \"H\u00e6res.\" lv. 3, passim</ref> have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some Rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with [[Phinehas]].<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xlvii.; Targ. Yer. on Num. xxv. 12</ref>\n\nAccording to later [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature, Elijah was really an [[angel]] in human form,<ref name=EB1911/> so that he had neither parents nor offspring.<ref>Yal\u1e33u\u1e6d Reubeni, Bereshit, 9a, ed. Amsterdam</ref>\n\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\n\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"<ref>Baba Metzia 14B</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's zeal for God ===\n[[File:Statue of Saint Elijah at Saint Elijah Maronite Cathedral, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of Elijah at the [[Saint Elias Cathedral]], [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nIn spite of Elijah's many miracles, the mass of the Jewish people remained as godless as before. A [[midrash]]{{which|date=February 2019}} tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.<ref>Pir\u1e33e R. El. xxix.</ref>\n\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.<ref>Tanna debe Eliyahu Zu\u1e6da viii.</ref>\n\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds.\" This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.<ref>Tan., Pe\u1e33ude, p.&nbsp;128, Vienna ed.</ref>\n\nThree years after this vision, Elijah was \"translated.\"<ref>Seder 'Olam R. xvii.</ref> Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.<ref>\u1e32id. 70; Ber. R. xxxiv. 8</ref>\n\nBut as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper.<ref>Suk. 5a</ref> In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah,<ref>Compare Pir\u1e33e R. El. xvi.</ref> but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.\n\n=== Ecclesiasticus ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"At the appointed time, it is written, you are destined<br />\nto calm the wrath of God before it breaks out in fury,<br />\nto turn the hearts of parents to their children,<br />\nand to restore the tribes of Jacob.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2014 A line in [[Ecclesiasticus]] describing Elijah's mission (Ecclesiasticus 48:10).\n|}\nIn the [[Ben Sira|Wisdom of Jesus ben Sira]] ({{Bibleverse||Sirach|48:10|NRSV}}) his tasks are altered to: 1) herald the eschaton, 2) calm God's fury, 3) restore familial peace, and 4) restore the 12 tribes.\n\n== Elijah in Judaism ==\n=== Elijah's chair ===\n{{See also|Brit milah}}\n[[File:Chair of Elijah.JPG|thumb|\"Chair of Elijah\" used during the [[brit milah]] (circumcision) ceremony. The [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] inscription reads \"This is the chair of Elijah, remembered for Good.\"]]\n\nAt Jewish [[Brit milah|circumcision]] ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a [[witness]] at all circumcisions when the sign of the [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19|HE}}): Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on [[Mount Carmel]]. ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18|HE}}) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\" ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:10|HE}}). According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:18|HE}}), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.<ref>\"Elijah, Chair of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref><ref>Unterman, Alan. \"Elijah's Chair.\" ''Dictionary of Jewish Lore and Legend.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1991.</ref>\n\n=== Elijah's cup ===\n{{See also|Passover Seder}}\nIn the [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]], Elijah would visit [[rabbis]] to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the [[Jewish Eschatology|eschaton]]. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes.\"<ref>\"Elijah, Cup of.\" ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971.</ref>\n\nOne such decision was whether the [[Passover Seder]] required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the [[Book of Exodus]]:\n\n<blockquote>I am the Lord, and ''I will bring you out'' from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and ''I will deliver you'' from their bondage, and ''I will redeem you'' with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and ''I will take you'' for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:6\u20137|HE}}).</blockquote>\n\nThe next verse, \"And ''I will bring you'' into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:8|HE}}) was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\n\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.<ref name=\" Temple\">Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish Literacy.''

As part of the concluding [[hymn]], an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\n== Elijah in Jewish folklore ==\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 580.</ref> ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:25|HE}}). Because of Phinehas' zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, \"a covenant of lasting priesthood\" ({{Bibleverse||Numbers|25:13|HE}}). Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel [[Sandalphon]],<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Jewish Philadelphia: Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 589</ref> whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. pp. 590\u201391.</ref> Yet another name for Elijah is \"Angel of the Covenant\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 201.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ===\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood)<ref>Bialik, H. N. and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki|Y. H Ravnitzky]]. eds. ''The Book of Legends: Sefer Ha-Aggadah.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1992. pp. 756, 782, 805.</ref> to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\n\nOne such story is that of Rabbi [[Joshua ben Levi]]. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.\n\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 599.</ref>\n\n=== Rabbi Eliezer ===\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai|Simon ben Yohai]] is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956. p. 597.</ref>\n\n=== Lilith ===\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of [[Lilith]]. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref><ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. ''Legends of the Bible.'' Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956.</ref>\n\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.\n\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"<ref>Schwartz, Howard. ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 224\u201325.</ref>\n\n== Elijah in Christianity ==\n=== References in the New Testament ===\n[[File:Intesa elijah.jpg|thumb|A Northern Russian icon from ca. 1290 showing the ascent of Elijah toward heaven]]\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] would say for those who believed, [[John the Baptist]] was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by [[Malachi]].\n\nSome English translations of the New Testament use [[Elias]], a Latin form of the name. In the [[King James Version]], \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\n\n==== John the Baptist ====\n[[John the Baptist]] preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ([[Matthew 3:4]], {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:6|9}}). He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\n\nIn the [[Gospel of John]], when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\" ({{Bibleverse||John|1:21|9}}). {{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:10\u201313|9}} however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist]] in Luke, [[Gabriel]] appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah\" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|9}}).\n\n==== Jesus Christ ====\n[[File:Transfigurationbloch.jpg|thumb|right|Elijah appeared at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].]]\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Herod Antipas]] hears some of the stories surrounding [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Some tell Herod that Jesus is John the Baptist (whom Herod had executed) come back to life. Others tell him that Jesus is Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:7\u20139|9}} also {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:14\u201316|9}}</ref> Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:18\u201319|9}}, also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|16:13\u201316|9}}</ref>\n\nHowever Jesus' ministry had little in common with that of Elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while Elijah killed his. [[Miracle]] stories similar to those of Elijah were associated with Jesus (''e.g.'', raising of the dead,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Mark|5:21\u201343|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|7:11\u201315|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|8:49\u201356|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|11|9}}</ref> miraculous feeding).<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:13\u201321|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:34\u201345|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:10\u201317|9}}, {{Bibleverse||John|6:5\u201316|9}}; also {{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:29\u201338|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Mark|8:1\u20139|9}}</ref> Jesus implicitly separates himself from Elijah when he rebukes James and John for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming Samaritan village in a similar manner to Elijah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:51\u201356|9}}</ref> Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:61\u201362|9}}, {{Bibleverse||1 Kings|19:16\u201321|9}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]], some of the onlookers wonder if Elijah will come to rescue him,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:46\u201349|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:35\u201336|9}}</ref> as by the time of Jesus, Elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of Jews in distress.\n\n==== Transfiguration ====\nElijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:1\u201313|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|9:2\u201313|9}} and {{Bibleverse||Luke|9:28\u201336|9}}</ref>\n\nAt the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus' face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son.\" The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.<!-- I know that there has been a tabernacle built, I just need to find a source. -->\n\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus (John 4:19) \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced [[Son of God]].<ref>Albright, W.

In {{Bibleverse||Luke|4:24\u201327|9}}, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets.

In {{Bibleverse||Romans|11:1\u20136|9}}, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:35|9}} (\"Women received their dead raised to life again...\") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha [[Raising of the son of the woman of Shunem|raising the son of the woman of Shunem]], citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith.<ref name=\"HebrewsGill\">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=John |title=Hebrews 11:35 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/hebrews-11-35.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsHenry\">{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Hebrews 11 |work=biblestudytools.com |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/hebrews/11.html |accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"HebrewsJamieson\">{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Robert Jamieson, A.

In writing of St. [[Albert Avogadro|Albert]], Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist [[Daniel Papebroch]] stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly.  From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of [[Jean de Launoy]] and the [[Sorbonne]]. In November 1698, [[Pope Innocent XII]] ordered an end to the controversy.<ref>[http://carmelitenuns.com/Controversies_Oother_Orders.htm  \"Controversies with Other Orders\", The Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\"]</ref>\n\n==== Liturgical commemorations ====\n[[Image:Prophet-Elias-Grk-ikon.png|thumb|Elias on [[Mount Horeb]], as depicted in a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]]]\n\nSince most [[Eastern Churches]] either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, ''Elias'' (or its modern [[iotacism|iotacized]] form ''Ilias'') is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]].\n\nThe [[feast day]] of [[saint]] Elias falls on July 20 of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|Orthodox liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], July 20 currently falls on August 2 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\n\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nThe [[Apolytikion]] in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>The incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Kontakion]] in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\n\n<blockquote>O Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.</blockquote>\n\n==== {{anchor|Helios}}Pagan associations and mountaintops ====\n{{See also|Peryn#The cult of Peroun in Peryn and in Novgorod}}\n\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with [[Helios]], the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ([[2 Kings 2:11]]) just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust sacrifice]] offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}) corresponds to the sun warming the earth.<ref>J.

Since Wachsmuth (1864),<ref>C. Wachsmuth, ''Das alte Griechenland im neuen'', 1864, p. 23, cited by Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'', 1907, p. 174</ref> the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias.<ref>Delehaye, p. 174</ref> The modern folklore is not good evidence for the ''origin'' of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops.<ref name=\"cook\"/> Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".<ref>F. Lenormant, ''Monographie de la voie sacr\u00e9e \u00c9leusinienne'', 1864, p. 452 as quoted by Delehaye, p. 174</ref>\n\nThe association of Elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with [[Zeus]], especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lighting, and wind. When Elias prevailed over the priests of [[Baal]], it was on [[Mount Carmel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}), which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on [[Mount Horeb]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:8|9}}). When Elias confronted [[Ahab]], he stopped the rains for three years ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|17:1-18:1|9}}).<ref name=\"cook\">[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', 1925, p. 178 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9iShet_ZtHAC&pg=PA178 Google Books]</ref>\n\nA map of mountain-cults of Zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to Elias, including [[Mount Olympus]], [[Mount Lykaion]], [[Mount Arachnaion]], and [[Mount Taleton]] on the mainland, and [[Mount Kenaion]], [[Mount Oche]], and [[Mount Kynados]] in the islands. Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.<ref name=\"cook\" />\n\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\n\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to [[Ljuboten]] on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as ''Aligjyn'' (\"Ali Day\"), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elsie |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAtQZ0vjf5gC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=%22Ali%20day%22%20Aligjyni&f=false |title=A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture |publisher=NYU Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0814722145 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ilia chariot.jpg|thumb|This common depiction of the prophet Elijah riding a flaming chariot across the sky resulted in [[syncretism|syncretistic]] folklore among the [[Slavs]] incorporating pre-Christian motifs in the beliefs and rites regarding him in [[Slavic culture]].]]\nAs Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted [[Slavic tribes]] likely found him an ideal analogy for [[Perun#Post-Christian Perun|Perun]], the supreme [[Slavic mythology#Pantheon|Slavic god]] of storms, thunder and lightning bolts.

He was a prophet of the desert, like John the Baptist, unlike our holy Prophet, who took part in, controlled, and guided all the affairs of his people. Both Ahab and Azariah were prone to lapse into the worship of Baal, the sun-god worshipped in Syria. That worship also included the worship of nature-powers and procreative powers, as in the Hindu worship of the Lingam, and led to many abuses.

The Quran states, \"Verily Elijah was one of the apostles. When he said to his people: \"Will you not fear [[Allah|God]]? \"Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your {{LORD}} and Cherisher and the {{LORD}} and Cherisher of your fathers of old?\" [[As-Saaffat]] 123\u2013126<ref>{{Cite quran|37|123|e=126|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran makes it clear that the majority of Elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry.

He is believed to have been a \"prophet of the desert\u2014like [[John the Baptist]]\".<ref>Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, Commentary'', ''Note on Elijah''</ref> Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife [[Jezebel]], who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of [[False god|false idols]] in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of [[God]] to Israel after him.<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, ''Stories of Elias and Elisha''</ref>\n\nElijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr, and in one legend, with [[Muhammad]] himself.<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Elijah'': \"Muslim exegetes report that the prophet Muhammad and a band of followers once met Elijah on a journey outside Mecca. Elijah served the prophet with food from heaven and then left on a cloud heading for the heavens\"</ref> In [[Islamic]] [[mysticism]], Elijah is associated closely with the sage [[Khidr]]. One hadith reported that Elijah and [[Khidr]] met together every year in [[Jerusalem]] to go on the [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Elijah'': \"It is reported by Ibn Kathir that every year during the month of [[Ramadan]] in [[Jerusalem]], the prophets Elijah and [[Khidr]] meet...\"</ref> Elijah appears also in the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of [[Khidr]] as well as one who drank from the [[Fountain of Youth]].<ref>''The Adventures of Amir Hamza'', trans. M. A. Farooqi, cf. List of Characters: ''Ilyas'' or ''Prophet Elias''</ref>\n\nFurther, It is narrated in [[Kitab al-Kafi]] that Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] was reciting the prostration of Ilyas (Elijah) in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars: \n<blockquote><poem>\n\"O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?\" To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, \"Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you\".<ref name=\"Kulayni\">{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad ibn Ya\u2019qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}</ref>\n</blockquote></poem>\n\nAlthough most [[Muslim]] scholars believed that Elijah preached in [[Israel]], some early commentators on the [[Qur'an]] stated that Elijah was sent to [[Baalbek]], in [[Lebanon]].<ref>''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Elias and Elisha''</ref> Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of ''[[Baal]]'', which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping.

The Hebrew text at {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17:4\u20136|HE}} uses the word {{lang|he|\u05e2\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd}} ''`\u014drv\u012bm'', which means ''ravens'', but with a different vocalization might equally mean ''Arabs''. The [[Septuagint]] has {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}}, ''ravens'', and other traditional translations followed.\n\nAlternatives have been proposed for many years; for example [[Adam Clarke]] (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing.<ref>[[Adam Clarke|Clarke, Adam]]. The Holy Bible ... with a Commentary and Critical Notes, Volume II, London 1836</ref> Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean (see {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13\u201317|HE}}) as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.\n\nProf. John Gray chooses ''Arabs'', saying \"We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman.\"<ref>Gray, John. Old Testament Library, I & II Kings, SCM Press, London, 1964</ref> His translation of the verses in question is:\n\n<blockquote>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there. And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah and went and dwelt in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan. And the Arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.</blockquote>\n\n===Fire on Mount Carmel===\nThe challenge to the priests of Baal had the two-fold purpose of demonstrating that the God of Israel was greater than Baal, and that it was he who was the giver of rain.

Either the letter was written before he went to heaven and delivered by a messenger on earth (unlikely), or Elijah was \"caught away\" as was Philip from the Gaza Road to Azotas, (about 17 miles, Acts 8:39, 40) for an unspecified purpose and returned to the earth. Consider the evidence: 1. Elijah had been taken to heaven in a whirlwind. (2 Kings 2:11). 2. Elisha had taken over the duties of Elijah in the reign of Jehoshaphat. (2 Kings 3:10, 11)., 3. Jehoram received a letter from Elijah, the prophet. (2 Chron. 21:1, 9\u201312). King Jehoram reigned after Jehoshaphat.

For many Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|17:9\u201313|9}}).

The oratorio chronicles many episodes of Elijah's life, including his challenge to Ahab and the contest of the gods, the miracle of raising the dead, and his ascension into heaven. Composed and premiered in 1846, the oratorio was criticized by members of the [[New German School]] but nonetheless remains one of the most popular Romantic choral-orchestral works in the repertoire.\n* In his ethnography ''[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape]'', anthropologist [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107] discusses the [[syncretic]] harvest feast of Elijah's Day (''Ilindan/Ali\u0111un''), shared by Christians and Muslims throughout [[Bosnia]].<ref>Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107, S.

Starting with a well-known Bosnian proverb about Elijah's two names \"Ilija until noon - Alija after noon\" (''Do podne Ilija, od podne Alija''), Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discusses the traditional and postwar waiting for Elijah, as well as the plethora of other characters he merges with (e.g. Slavic deity [[Perun]] and prophet [[Khidr]]). As the central trope in the book, the waiting for Elijah becomes the waiting for the restoration of home and cosmology after nationalist violence. The absence of Elijah is reminiscent of the one in Jewish rituals and Had\u017eiMuhamedovi\u0107 discovers an imaginative form of political resistance in the waiting for Elijah's return. \n* In ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', the English knight [[Astolfo]] flies up to the moon in Elijah's flaming chariot.\n* [[Elijah Rock]] is a traditional Christian [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] about Elijah, also sometimes used by Jewish youth groups.\n* \"Go Like Elijah\" is a song by the American rock-pop-jazz songwriter [[Chi Coltrane]].\n* [[Lorenzetto]] created a statue of Elijah with assistance of the young sculptor [[Raffaello da Montelupo]], using designs by Raphael.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |title=Link to on-line biography of Lorenzetto from Vasari's '&#39;Vite'&#39; |publisher=Efn.org |accessdate=2014-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222204918/http://efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLorenz.html |archive-date=2009-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Fifth Mountain]]'' by [[Paulo Coelho]] is based on the story of Elijah.\n* Christian metal band [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]] released the song \"God of Elijah\" on their 2001 album [[By God]].
