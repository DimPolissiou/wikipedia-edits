Only adult males have the distinctive small, rusty-brown throat patch, which gives the species its common name and the absence of which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark brownish-grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail has prominent white patches on the tips of the outer feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. It may be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. It is unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.<ref name=HANZAB>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds.

The redthroat has even been known to mimic the non-vocal sound of whistling wingbeats made by a [[crested pigeon]] in flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Pyrrholaemus-brunneus|title=Redthroat (Pyrrholaemus brunneus) :: xeno-canto|website=www.xeno-canto.org|access-date=2017-06-15}}</ref><ref name=HANZAB/> Although both sexes call throughout the year, during the breeding season male calls are more sustained. The species is vocal when foraging and will also sing while perched atop shrubs and taller trees.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe redthroat is endemic to mainland Australia, occurring in all states and territories, except the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Tasmania]]. The species is most prevalent in Western Australia and South Australia. It has a widespread but scattered distribution throughout most of South Australia. In Western Australia, the species is not present in the far north or the south-east, but is prevalent throughout the mid-latitudes of the state. In the Northern Territory, the species is restricted to the south of the state, around the [[Simpson Desert]] and the [[MacDonnell Ranges]]. In Queensland, the species is restricted to inland south-western regions. In Victoria, the species is restricted to the [[mallee]] regions in the north west of the state.<ref name=HANZAB/> In New South Wales, the species is only known to occur in the far west, in several core populations, including Broken Hill, Tibooburra, Penarie and Nearie Lake Nature Reserve.<ref name=NSWOEH>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=10721|title=Redthroat - profile|last=|first= |date=|website=NSW Government, Office of Environment and Heritage|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe species is thought to be mostly sedentary, with no evidence to suggest seasonal migration. Individuals recaptured after banding have all been found within {{convert|10|km|miles|2}} of the banding site.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe habitat of the redthroat consists primarily of arid and semi-arid regions of inland Australia, but it also occupies some coastal areas, as well as plains and rangelands. Communities it favours are most often acacia and chenopod shrublands. These communities are usually characterised by an overstory of mulga (''[[Acacia aneura]]''), red mulga (''[[Acacia cyperophylla|A. cyperophylla]]'') or lacewood (''A. shirleyi'') with an understory of saltbush (''[[Atriplex]] sp''.), bluebush (''[[Chenopodium]] sp.)'' or emu bush (''[[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]] sp.)''.<ref name=HANZAB/> However, in some areas the species is known to occur in [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] with a diverse understory, semi-arid woodlands, [[banksia]] and [[Leptospermum|tea tree]] thickets and shrublands with an overstory of [[Callitris glaucophylla|white cypress]].<ref name=NSWOEH/> The consistent feature among these habitats appears to be the presence of a complex understory which provides suitable foraging and nesting resources for this shy, mostly ground-dwelling species.\n\n== Diet and foraging behaviour ==\nRedthroats are [[omnivore]]s with a diet consisting of seeds from grasses and shrubs as well as a broad variety of invertebrates such as spiders, molluscs and insects.<ref name=HANZAB/> Observations of redthroat foraging behaviour found that the species predominantly forages at heights of less than 1m (73% of observations) and was not observed foraging at heights greater than 3m.<ref name=Morris>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=WJ|last2=Wooler|first2=RD|date=2001|title=The structure and dynamics of an assemblage of small birds in a semi-arid eucalypt woodland in south-western Australia|journal=Emu |volume=101 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1071/MU00062}}</ref> This study found that redthroats feed mostly by pouncing on prey from the ground or [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] in low vegetation, with very few instances of hunting on the wing.<ref name=Morris /> Another study of foraging behaviour found that all observations of foraging occurred on the ground (<0.1 m), using a combination of gleaning and probing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Recher |first=HF|last2=Davis |first2=WD |date=2002 |title=Foraging profile of a Salmon Gum woodland avifauna in Western Australia|url= http://www.rswa.org.au/publications/Journal/85(2)/recher85(2).pdf |journal= Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia |volume=85 |pages=103\u2013111}}</ref>\n\n== Breeding and nesting ==\nBreeding mostly occurs between June\u2013December with some geographic variation in timing. Little is known about sexual behaviour, although the species appears to breed in pairs. Nests are relatively large for a bird of its size (9\u201314&nbsp;cm), often domed, spherical or domed with a round entrance near the top (2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm). Usually constructed of bark strips and bark fibre, often lined with feathers, fur or soft plant material. Nests are located on or close to the ground among shrubs, grass tussocks, at the base of trees, in fallen logs or in small depressions. Two to four eggs are laid and the female is solely responsible for incubating the eggs. The redthroat and the closely related speckled warbler are the only members of the acanthizids which have a solid coloured chocolate brown egg.<ref name=Gardner/> Furthermore, the redthroat (and the speckled warbler) are the primary host species of some [[brood parasite]]s such as the [[black-eared cuckoo]] (''Chrysococcyx osculans'')and [[fan-tailed cuckoo]] (''Cacomantis flabelliformis'') which remove redthroat eggs from the nest and lay their own similar looking eggs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hhhRGJNqQhIC&pg=PA244 |title=The Avian Brood Parasites: Deception at the Nest|last=Johnsgard |first=Paul A.|date=1997-11-06 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195354997 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n==Conservation status==\nPopulations of redthroats have declined in many areas throughout Australia and the species is subject to many threatening processes.

The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark brownish-grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail has prominent white patches on the tips of the outer feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. It may be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. It is unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.<ref name=HANZAB>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds.

The redthroat has even been known to mimic the non-vocal sound of whistling wingbeats made by a [[crested pigeon]] in flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Pyrrholaemus-brunneus|title=Redthroat (Pyrrholaemus brunneus) :: xeno-canto|website=www.xeno-canto.org|access-date=2017-06-15}}</ref><ref name=HANZAB/> Although both sexes call throughout the year, during the breeding season male calls are more sustained. The species is vocal when foraging and will also sing while perched atop shrubs and taller trees.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe redthroat is endemic to mainland Australia, occurring in all states and territories, except the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Tasmania]]. The species is most prevalent in Western Australia and South Australia. It has a widespread but scattered distribution throughout most of South Australia. In Western Australia, the species is not present in the far north or the south-east, but is prevalent throughout the mid-latitudes of the state. In the Northern Territory, the species is restricted to the south of the state, around the [[Simpson Desert]] and the [[MacDonnell Ranges]]. In Queensland, the species is restricted to inland south-western regions. In Victoria, the species is restricted to the [[mallee]] regions in the north west of the state.<ref name=HANZAB/> In New South Wales, the species is only known to occur in the far west, in several core populations, including Broken Hill, Tibooburra, Penarie and Nearie Lake Nature Reserve.<ref name=NSWOEH>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=10721|title=Redthroat - profile|last=|first= |date=|website=NSW Government, Office of Environment and Heritage|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe species is thought to be mostly sedentary, with no evidence to suggest seasonal migration. Individuals recaptured after banding have all been found within {{convert|10|km|miles|2}} of the banding site.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe habitat of the redthroat consists primarily of arid and semi-arid regions of inland Australia, but it also occupies some coastal areas, as well as plains and rangelands. Communities it favours are most often acacia and chenopod shrublands. These communities are usually characterised by an overstory of mulga (''[[Acacia aneura]]''), red mulga (''[[Acacia cyperophylla|A. cyperophylla]]'') or lacewood (''A. shirleyi'') with an understory of saltbush (''[[Atriplex]] sp''.), bluebush (''[[Chenopodium]] sp.)'' or emu bush (''[[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]] sp.)''.<ref name=HANZAB/> However, in some areas the species is known to occur in [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] with a diverse understory, semi-arid woodlands, [[banksia]] and [[Leptospermum|tea tree]] thickets and shrublands with an overstory of [[Callitris glaucophylla|white cypress]].<ref name=NSWOEH/> The consistent feature among these habitats appears to be the presence of a complex understory which provides suitable foraging and nesting resources for this shy, mostly ground-dwelling species.\n\n== Diet and foraging behaviour ==\nRedthroats are [[omnivore]]s with a diet consisting of seeds from grasses and shrubs as well as a broad variety of invertebrates such as spiders, molluscs and insects.<ref name=HANZAB/> Observations of redthroat foraging behaviour found that the species predominantly forages at heights of less than 1m (73% of observations) and was not observed foraging at heights greater than 3m.<ref name=Morris>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=WJ|last2=Wooler|first2=RD|date=2001|title=The structure and dynamics of an assemblage of small birds in a semi-arid eucalypt woodland in south-western Australia|journal=Emu |volume=101 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1071/MU00062}}</ref> This study found that redthroats feed mostly by pouncing on prey from the ground or [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] in low vegetation, with very few instances of hunting on the wing.<ref name=Morris /> Another study of foraging behaviour found that all observations of foraging occurred on the ground (<0.1 m), using a combination of gleaning and probing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Recher |first=HF|last2=Davis |first2=WD |date=2002 |title=Foraging profile of a Salmon Gum woodland avifauna in Western Australia|url= http://www.rswa.org.au/publications/Journal/85(2)/recher85(2).pdf |journal= Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia |volume=85 |pages=103\u2013111}}</ref>\n\n== Breeding and nesting ==\nBreeding mostly occurs between June\u2013December with some geographic variation in timing. Little is known about sexual behaviour, although the species appears to breed in pairs. Nests are relatively large for a bird of its size (9\u201314&nbsp;cm), often domed, spherical or domed with a round entrance near the top (2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm). Usually constructed of bark strips and bark fibre, often lined with feathers, fur or soft plant material. Nests are located on or close to the ground among shrubs, grass tussocks, at the base of trees, in fallen logs or in small depressions. Two to four eggs are laid and the female is solely responsible for incubating the eggs. The redthroat and the closely related speckled warbler are the only members of the acanthizids which have a solid coloured chocolate brown egg.<ref name=Gardner/> Furthermore, the redthroat (and the speckled warbler) are the primary host species of some [[brood parasite]]s such as the [[black-eared cuckoo]] and [[fan-tailed cuckoo]] which remove redthroat eggs from the nest and lay their own similar looking eggs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hhhRGJNqQhIC&pg=PA244 |title=The Avian Brood Parasites: Deception at the Nest|last=Johnsgard |first=Paul A.|date=1997-11-06 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195354997 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=HANZAB/>\n\n==Conservation status==\nPopulations of redthroats have declined in many areas throughout Australia and the species is subject to many threatening processes.

The ongoing impacts of land clearing, noxious weeds, introduced herbivore and introduced predators are likely to cause further declines throughout the species range, which may warrant further environmental protection measures.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

It was released by [[Capitol Records]] on 17 April 2020. O'Brien is best known as one of the guitarists of [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]. The album was produced by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] and [[Catherine Marks]] and features musicians including drummer [[Omar Hakim]], [[The Invisible (band)|Invisible]] members [[Nathan East]] and [[Dave Okumu]], folk singer [[Laura Marling]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] guitarist [[Adrian Utley]], [[Wilco]] drummer [[Glenn Kotche]] and Radiohead bassist [[Colin Greenwood]]. It has received favourable reviews.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nO'Brien had been writing music for years, especially around the time of Radiohead's 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'', but had never written lyrics. He said: \"I was a bit like a dog at the [[Battersea Dog's Home|Battersea dog\u2019s home]] \u2013 I had no self-confidence, I was slightly beaten up.\"<ref name=\"Face\" /> O'Brien wrote \"Banksters\" in 2009 in response to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007\u20132008 financial crisis]].<ref name=\"Face\" />\n\nIn 2012, O'Brien and his family moved to Brazil, living for a year on a farm near [[Ubatuba]]. There, O'Brien planned to create electronic music using [[Ableton Live]], inspired by [[dubstep]] and electronic musician [[Burial (musician)|Burial]], but found it \"didn't resonate with me in Brazil\". Instead, he was inspired by the [[Primal Scream]] album ''[[Screamadelica]]'' (1991): \"I put [it] on for the first time in years and I had a fucking eureka moment ... It was rave, and it was connectedness, it was hope, it was powerful.\"<ref name=\"Face\" /> He described attending [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] as another \"eureka moment\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/12/radiohead-ed-obrien-debut-solo-album-release-date-2020/|title=Radiohead's Ed O'Brien to release debut solo album in 2020, new single \"Brasil\" coming this week|date=2019-12-02|website=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> and said the album was inspired by \"the spirit and being in Brazil, [of] open-heartedness, rhythm, colour\".<ref name=\"Face\" />\n\nO'Brien considered taking the songs to Radiohead, but felt they had a \"distinct energy\" that would be lost if it became a \"hybrid product\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://torontosun.com/entertainment/music/radioheads-ed-obrien-finds-own-voice-on-earth-something-was-missing|title=Radiohead\u2019s Ed O\u2019Brien on going solo: \u2018Something was missing\u2019 {{!}} Toronto Sun|last=SUN|first=Toronto|last2=Entertainment|date=2020-04-17|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-18|last3=Music|last4=Email|first4=Share Radiohead's Ed O'Brien finds own voice on 'Earth': 'Something was missing' Tumblr Pinterest Google Plus Reddit LinkedIn|last5=Tumblr|last6=Pinterest|last7=Plus|first7=Google|last8=Reddit|last9=LinkedIn}}</ref> He initially planned to have someone else sing, and considered asking his Radiohead bandmate [[Thom Yorke]].<ref name=\"Face\" /> He decided to sing himself after he was pleased with his demo recordings, made with producer [[Ian Davenport]] in 2014.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recording with Flood began in late 2017 and ended in early 2019,<ref name=\"Face\">{{Cite web|url=https://theface.com/music/radiohead-guitarist-ed-obrien-album-shangri-la-interview-thom-yorke|title=Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien steps up|website=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> in the [[Cambrian Mountains]] in Wales and Flood's Assault & Battery studios in London.<ref name=\"Face\" />\n\nO'Brien wanted to call the album ''Pale Blue Dot'', in reference to [[Pale Blue Dot|the space photograph]], but was prevented by copyright problems.

It was released by [[Capitol Records]] on 17 April 2020. O'Brien is best known as one of the guitarists of [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]. The album was produced by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] and [[Catherine Marks]] and features musicians including drummer [[Omar Hakim]], [[The Invisible (band)|Invisible]] members [[Nathan East]] and [[Dave Okumu]], folk singer [[Laura Marling]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] guitarist [[Adrian Utley]], [[Wilco]] drummer [[Glenn Kotche]] and Radiohead bassist [[Colin Greenwood]]. It has received favourable reviews.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nO'Brien had been writing music for years, especially around the time of Radiohead's 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]'', but had never written lyrics. He said: \"I was a bit like a dog at the [[Battersea Dog's Home|Battersea dog\u2019s home]] \u2013 I had no self-confidence, I was slightly beaten up.\"<ref name=\"Face\" /> O'Brien wrote \"Banksters\" in 2009 in response to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007\u20132008 financial crisis]].<ref name=\"Face\" />\n\nIn 2012, O'Brien and his family moved to Brazil, living for a year on a farm near [[Ubatuba]]. There, O'Brien planned to create electronic music using [[Ableton Live]], inspired by [[dubstep]] and electronic musician [[Burial (musician)|Burial]], but found it \"didn't resonate with me in Brazil\". Instead, he was inspired by the [[Primal Scream]] album ''[[Screamadelica]]'' (1991): \"I put [it] on for the first time in years and I had a fucking eureka moment ... It was rave, and it was connectedness, it was hope, it was powerful.\"<ref name=\"Face\" /> He described attending [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] as another \"eureka moment\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/12/radiohead-ed-obrien-debut-solo-album-release-date-2020/|title=Radiohead's Ed O'Brien to release debut solo album in 2020, new single \"Brasil\" coming this week|date=2019-12-02|website=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> and said the album was inspired by \"the spirit and being in Brazil, [of] open-heartedness, rhythm, colour\".<ref name=\"Face\" />\n\nO'Brien considered taking the songs to Radiohead, but felt they had a \"distinct energy\" that would be lost if it became a \"hybrid product\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://torontosun.com/entertainment/music/radioheads-ed-obrien-finds-own-voice-on-earth-something-was-missing|title=Radiohead\u2019s Ed O\u2019Brien on going solo: \u2018Something was missing\u2019 {{!}} Toronto Sun|last=SUN|first=Toronto|last2=Entertainment|date=2020-04-17|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-18|last3=Music|last4=Email|first4=Share Radiohead's Ed O'Brien finds own voice on 'Earth': 'Something was missing' Tumblr Pinterest Google Plus Reddit LinkedIn|last5=Tumblr|last6=Pinterest|last7=Plus|first7=Google|last8=Reddit|last9=LinkedIn}}</ref> He initially planned to have someone else sing, and considered asking his Radiohead bandmate [[Thom Yorke]].<ref name=\"Face\" /> He decided to sing himself after he was pleased with his demo recordings, made with producer [[Ian Davenport]] in 2014.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recording with Flood began in late 2017 and ended in early 2019,<ref name=\"Face\">{{Cite web|url=https://theface.com/music/radiohead-guitarist-ed-obrien-album-shangri-la-interview-thom-yorke|title=Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien steps up|website=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> in the [[Cambrian Mountains]] in Wales and Flood's Assault & Battery studios in London.<ref name=\"Face\" />\n\nO'Brien wanted to call the album ''Pale Blue Dot'', in reference to [[Pale Blue Dot|the space photograph]], but was prevented by copyright problems.

This may have been chosen by the writer or director because while the crowd singing it is almost completely American, the person they are singing it about is British.\n\nIn the United States, the \"And so say all of us\" version is often found East of the [[Mississippi River]], while the \"which nobody can deny\" variation is far more common West of the Mississippi.{{fact|date=July 2018}} In both regions, prior to the popularization of the \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" song,{{when|date=June 2019}} \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" was the most commonly sung birthday song.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs with many songs that use gender-specific pronouns, the song can be altered to agree with the gender of the intended recipient, \"he\" being replaced with \"she\".<ref>Originally the song was associated with after-dinner drinking by all-male groups and not used for females. In 1856  British officers in the Crimea mistakenly sang it after a toast had been made, in Russian, to the Empress of Russia:'...peals of laughter followed when they all learned the subject of the toast, which was afterwards drunk again with due honour and respect.' ''Blackwood's Magazine'', Volume 80, October 1856</ref> If the song is being sung to two or more people (e.g. twins or triplets) it is altered to use plurals (i.e. \"For ''They'' are Jolly Good Fellow''s''.\")\n\n===British version===\n\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), and so say all of us\n:And so say all of us, and so say all of us\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), and so say all of us!\n\n===American version===\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), which nobody can deny\n:Which nobody can deny, which nobody can deny\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), which nobody can deny!\n\n==Melody==\n<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\\relative c' { \\key f \\major \\time 6/8 \\partial 8\nc'8 | a4 a8 a8 g8 a8 |bes4. a4 a8 | g4 g8 g8 f8 g8 | a4. f4 g8 | a4 a8 a8 g8 a8| |bes4. d4\\fermata d8 | c8 d8 c8 bes4 g8 f2 \n }\n\\addlyrics {\nFor he's a jol- ly good fell- ow, for he's a jol- ly good fell- ow, for he's a jol- ly good fell- ow, \nwhich no- bo- dy can de- ny }\n\n</score>\n\n\n==Pause length==\nThe last syllable of the third iteration of \"For he's a jolly good fellow\" is often sung with an exaggerated [[fermata]] or pause before going on, making it difficult for groups or crowds to sing the next line in unison. This is evident, for example, when sung as a crowd chant in a football stadium or at a birthday party. Typically the note is extended an additional half measure, though it is acceptable to have no addition or extend the note for a full measure. <!-- Claiming no cite needed because common knowledge here. -->\n\n== Variations ==\n*  The British and American versions can be combined, normally with \"and so say all of us\" in the middle of the verse, and \"which nobody can deny\" at the end.\n* In [[Spain]], it is sometimes sung at birthdays instead of \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\". This is also the case in America on television and in movies, because [[Warner/Chappell Music]] claimed copyright to \"Happy Birthday To You\" until 2016, while \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" has long been in the [[public domain]].\n* \"Nobody\" is sometimes replaced by \"no one\".\n* [[Bing Crosby]] included the song in a medley on his album ''[[101 Gang Songs]]'' (1961)\n*In the ''[[Porridge (TV series) |Porridge]]'' episode \"[[Disturbing the Peace (Porridge) |Disturbing the Peace]]\", all the prisoners greet [[Mr Mackay]] to this song, having successfully eliminated Mr. Wainwright.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://kids.niehs.nih.gov/games/songs/favorites/jolly-good-fellow/index.htm For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, Lyrics and Sound]\n\n'''\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[Category:English folk songs]]\n[[Category:English children's songs]]\n[[Category:Traditional children's songs]]\n[[Category:1709 songs]]\n[[Category:War of the Spanish Succession]]\n[[Category:Songs about birthdays]]\n[[Category:Songs about birthday parties]]\n[[Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 18th century]]\n[[Category:Quotations from music]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox song\n| name      = For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\n| cover     =\n| alt       =\n| type      =\n| language  = English\n| written   =\n| published =\n| writer    =\n| composer  =\n| lyricist  =\n}}\n\"'''For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'''\" is a popular [[song]] that is sung to congratulate a person on a significant event, such as a [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], a [[birthday]], a [[wedding]] (or playing a major part in a wedding), a [[wedding anniversary]], the [[birth]] of a child, or the winning of a [[Final (competition)|championship]] sporting event.

This may have been chosen by the writer or director because while the crowd singing it is almost completely American, the person they are singing it about is British.\n\nIn the United States, the \"And so say all of us\" version is often found East of the [[Mississippi River]], while the \"which nobody can deny\" variation is far more common West of the Mississippi.{{fact|date=July 2018}} In both regions, prior to the popularization of the \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" song,{{when|date=June 2019}} \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" was the most commonly sung birthday song.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs with many songs that use gender-specific pronouns, the song can be altered to agree with the gender of the intended recipient, \"he\" being replaced with \"she\".<ref>Originally the song was associated with after-dinner drinking by all-male groups and not used for females. In 1856  British officers in the Crimea mistakenly sang it after a toast had been made, in Russian, to the Empress of Russia:'...peals of laughter followed when they all learned the subject of the toast, which was afterwards drunk again with due honour and respect.' ''Blackwood's Magazine'', Volume 80, October 1856</ref> If the song is being sung to two or more people (e.g. twins or triplets) it is altered to use plurals (i.e. \"For ''They'' are Jolly Good Fellow''s''.\")\n\n===British version===\n\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), and so say all of us\n:And so say all of us, and so say all of us\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), and so say all of us!\n\n===American version===\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), which nobody can deny\n:Which nobody can deny, which nobody can deny\n:For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow\n:For he's a jolly good fellow (pause), which nobody can deny!\n\n==Melody==\n<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\\relative c' { \\key f \\major \\time 6/8 \\partial 8\nc'8 | a4 a8 a8 g8 a8 |bes4. a4 a8 | g4 g8 g8 f8 g8 | a4. f4 g8 | a4 a8 a8 g8 a8| |bes4. d4\\fermata d8 | c8 d8 c8 bes4 g8 f2 \n }\n\\addlyrics {\nFor he's a jol- ly good fell- ow, for he's a jol- ly good fell- ow, for he's a jol- ly good fell- ow, \nwhich no- bo- dy can de- ny }\n\n</score>\n\n\n==Pause length==\nThe last syllable of the third iteration of \"For he's a jolly good fellow\" is often sung with an exaggerated [[fermata]] or pause before going on, making it difficult for groups or crowds to sing the next line in unison. This is evident, for example, when sung as a crowd chant in a football stadium or at a birthday party. Typically the note is extended an additional half measure, though it is acceptable to have no addition or extend the note for a full measure. <!-- Claiming no cite needed because common knowledge here. -->\n\n== Variations ==\n*  The British and American versions can be combined, normally with \"and so say all of us\" in the middle of the verse, and \"which nobody can deny\" at the end.\n* In [[Spain]], it is sometimes sung at birthdays instead of \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\". This is also the case in America on television and in movies, because [[Warner/Chappell Music]] claimed copyright to \"Happy Birthday To You\" until 2016, while \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" has long been in the [[public domain]].\n* \"Nobody\" is sometimes replaced by \"no one\".\n* [[Bing Crosby]] included the song in a medley on his album ''[[101 Gang Songs]]'' (1961)\n*In the ''[[Porridge (TV series) |Porridge]]'' episode \"[[Disturbing the Peace (Porridge) |Disturbing the Peace]]\", all the prisoners greet [[Mr Mackay]] to this song, having successfully eliminated Mr. Wainwright.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://kids.niehs.nih.gov/games/songs/favorites/jolly-good-fellow/index.htm For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, Lyrics and Sound]\n\n'''\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[Category:English folk songs]]\n[[Category:English children's songs]]\n[[Category:Traditional children's songs]]\n[[Category:English-language songs]]\n[[Category:1709 songs]]\n[[Category:War of the Spanish Succession]]\n[[Category:Songs about birthdays]]\n[[Category:Songs about birthday parties]]\n[[Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 18th century]]\n[[Category:Quotations from music]]\n", "name_user": "Richhoncho", "label": "safe", "comment": "removedCategory:English-language songsusingHotCat- container cat.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_He%27s_a_Jolly_Good_Fellow"}
