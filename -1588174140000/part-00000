H.A.B. Shapiro died in 1952; there were 25 students enrolled at that time, and his widow, who had increasingly administered the school as her husband's health declined, then ran the school until 1971, continuing as president emeritus until 1986.<ref>Cote, Joe, [https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2018/09/gertrude-shapiro \"The Leadership and Legacy of Gertrude Shapiro\"]. Southern New Hampshire University, September 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the school was incorporated and renamed the '''New Hampshire College of Accounting and Commerce'''. The state of [[New Hampshire]] granted the college its charter in 1963, which gave it degree-granting authority. The first [[associate degree]]s were awarded that year, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were conferred in 1966. The college became a [[nonprofit institution]] under a [[board of trustees]] in September 1968, and its name was shortened to '''New Hampshire College''' in 1969.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe 1970s were a time of growth and change. The college moved from its downtown Manchester site to the now {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} campus along the [[Merrimack River]], at the northern border of Manchester with the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]], in 1971. Academic offerings expanded with the introduction of a [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1974,<ref name=\"history\"/> as well as when [[human services]] programs were adopted from [[Franconia College]], which closed in 1978.<ref name=\"lessard\">{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/read-article/college-satellite-closes-in-manchester |title=College satellite closes in Manchester|publisher=[[Hippo Press|The Hippo]]|date=February 23, 2017|last=Lessard|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, New Hampshire College received authorization from the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire legislature]] to offer [[Master of Science]] degrees in business-related subjects, as well as Master of Human Services degrees. (All human services programs would be transferred to [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in Massachusetts by the end of the decade.)<ref name=\"lessard\"/> That same year, the college opened its North Campus on the site of the former [[Mount Saint Mary College (New Hampshire)|Mount Saint Mary College]], which had shut down three years earlier. The North Campus became the home of the [[culinary arts]] program, which was established in 1983.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nUltimately, the North Campus was sold,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| title=Hooksett's Mount Saint Mary's to be Converted to Condos| publisher=Brady Sullivan| accessdate=July 18, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804122255/http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| archivedate=August 4, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and its academic programs were consolidated back to the main campus. This spurred several major construction projects on the main campus in the mid-1990s: Washington Hall, a [[dormitory|residence hall]]; Webster Hall, home to the School of Business; the Hospitality Center, home of the Quill (a student-run [[restaurant]]) and culinary arts programs; and Belknap Hall, now home to the Institute for Language Education, the School of Education, and several university offices.

H.A.B. Shapiro died in 1952; there were 25 students enrolled at that time, and his widow, who had increasingly administered the school as her husband's health declined, then ran the school until 1971, continuing as president emeritus until 1986.<ref>Cote, Joe, [https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2018/09/gertrude-shapiro \"The Leadership and Legacy of Gertrude Shapiro\"]. Southern New Hampshire University, September 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the school was incorporated and renamed the '''New Hampshire College of Accounting and Commerce'''. The state of [[New Hampshire]] granted the college its charter in 1963, which gave it degree-granting authority. The first [[associate degree]]s were awarded that year, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were conferred in 1966. The college became a [[nonprofit institution]] under a [[board of trustees]] in September 1968, and its name was shortened to '''New Hampshire College''' in 1969.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe 1970s were a time of growth and change. The college moved from its downtown Manchester site to the now {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} campus along the [[Merrimack River]], at the northern border of Manchester with the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]], in 1971. Academic offerings expanded with the introduction of a [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1974,<ref name=\"history\"/> as well as when [[human services]] programs were adopted from [[Franconia College]], which closed in 1978.<ref name=\"lessard\">{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/read-article/college-satellite-closes-in-manchester |title=College satellite closes in Manchester|publisher=[[Hippo Press|The Hippo]]|date=February 23, 2017|last=Lessard|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, New Hampshire College received authorization from the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire legislature]] to offer [[Master of Science]] degrees in business-related subjects, as well as Master of Human Services degrees. (All human services programs would be transferred to [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in Massachusetts by the end of the decade.)<ref name=\"lessard\"/> That same year, the college opened its North Campus on the site of the former [[Mount Saint Mary College (New Hampshire)|Mount Saint Mary College]], which had shut down three years earlier. The North Campus became the home of the [[culinary arts]] program, which was established in 1983.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nUltimately, the North Campus was sold,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| title=Hooksett's Mount Saint Mary's to be Converted to Condos| publisher=Brady Sullivan| accessdate=July 18, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804122255/http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| archivedate=August 4, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and its academic programs were consolidated back to the main campus. This spurred several major construction projects on the main campus in the mid-1990s: Washington Hall, a [[dormitory|residence hall]]; Webster Hall, home to the School of Business; the Hospitality Center, home of the Quill (a student-run [[restaurant]]) and culinary arts programs; and Belknap Hall, now home to the Institute for Language Education, the School of Education, and several university offices. In 1995, New Hampshire College began offering [[distance learning]] programs through the [[Internet]]. In 1998, academic degrees were expanded to include a [[Ph.D.]] in [[community economic development]] and the [[Doctor of Business Administration]].<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nNew Hampshire College became '''Southern New Hampshire University''' on July 1, 2001.

LeBlanc addressed this in 2009 with an increased focus on the College of Online and Continuing Education. Rapid revenue growth from the division helped save the struggling main campus where enrollment had slumped.

On 16 April 1746, the [[Jacobite Army (1745)|Jacobite army]] of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] was decisively defeated by a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government force under [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], on Drummossie Moor near [[Inverness]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. It was the last [[pitched battle]] fought on British soil.\n\nCharles was the eldest son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the exiled [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] claimant to the British throne. Believing there was support for a Stuart restoration in both Scotland and England, he landed in Scotland in July 1745:  raising an army of Scots [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters, he took [[Edinburgh]] by September and defeated a British government force at [[Battle of Prestonpans|Prestonpans]]. The government recalled 12,000 troops from the Continent to deal with the rising: a Jacobite invasion of England reached as far as [[Derby]] before turning back, having attracted relatively few English recruits.\n\nThe Jacobites, with limited French military support, attempted to consolidate their control of Scotland, where by early 1746 they were opposed by a substantial government army. A scrambled Jacobite victory at [[Battle of Falkirk Muir|Falkirk]] failed to change the strategic situation: with supplies and pay running short and with the government troops resupplied and reorganised under the Duke of Cumberland, son of British monarch [[George II of England|George&nbsp;II]], the Jacobite leadership had few options left other than to stand and fight. The two armies eventually met at Culloden, on terrain that gave Cumberland's larger, well-rested force the advantage. The battle lasted only an hour, with the Jacobites suffering a bloody defeat; between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites were killed or wounded,<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> while about 300 government soldiers were killed or wounded.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/> While perhaps 5-6,000 Jacobites remained in arms in Scotland, the leadership took the decision to disperse, effectively ending the rising.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron. (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', pp.23-25</ref>\n\nCulloden and its aftermath continue to arouse strong feelings. The [[University of Glasgow]] awarded the Duke of Cumberland an honorary doctorate, but many modern commentators allege that the aftermath of the battle and subsequent crackdown on Jacobite sympathisers were brutal, earning Cumberland the [[sobriquet]] \"Butcher\". Efforts were subsequently made to further integrate the comparatively undeveloped [[Scottish Highlands]] into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; civil penalties were introduced to undermine the [[Scottish clan]] system, which had provided the Jacobites with the means to rapidly mobilise an army.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Jacobite rising of 1745}}\n[[File:Lost Portrait of Charles Edward Stuart.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Charles Stuart at Holyrood, 1745|The [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]], painted at Edinburgh in late 1745]]\n[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|alt=William, Duke of Cumberland|upright|Charles' dynastic and military opponent, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], ca 1757]]\n[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], died in 1714, with no living children. Under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], she was succeeded by her [[second cousin]] [[George I of Great Britain|George&nbsp;I]] of the [[House of Hanover]], who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], a daughter of [[James VI and I]]. Many, however, particularly in Scotland and Ireland, continued to support the claim to the throne of Anne's exiled half-brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]], excluded from the succession under the Act of Settlement due to his [[Roman Catholic]] religion.\n\nOn 23 July 1745 James's son [[Charles Edward Stuart]] landed on [[Eriskay]] in the Western Islands in an attempt to reclaim the throne of Great Britain for his father, accompanied only by the \"[[Seven Men of Moidart]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Roderick |title=Bonnie Prince Charlie: Truth or Lies |date=2014 |isbn=978-0861537839 |page=2 |publisher=St Andrew Press}}</ref> Most of his Scottish supporters advised he return to France, but his persuasion of [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel]] to back him encouraged others to commit and the rebellion was launched at [[Glenfinnan]] on 19 August.

In theory, a standard single-battalion British infantry regiment was 815 strong, including officers, but were often smaller in practice and at Culloden, the regiments were not much larger than about 400 men.<ref name=\"Harrington(1991)-p25-29\">Harrington (1991), pp. 25\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe government cavalry arrived in Scotland in January 1746.

Cumberland decided to wait out the winter, and moved his troops northwards to [[Aberdeen]]. 5,000 [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] troops, led by Prince [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick of Hesse]], took up position to the south to cut off any path of retreat for the Jacobites. The weather had improved to such an extent by 8 April that Cumberland resumed the campaign: his army reached [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]] on 11 April, where it was joined by six further battalions and two cavalry regiments.<ref name = \"PH-44\" /> Days later, the government army approached the [[River Spey]], guarded by a Jacobite detachment of 2,000 under [[John Drummond, 4th Duke of Perth|Lord John Drummond]]. Rather than offer resistance Drummond retreated towards [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and then to [[Nairn]], an act for which he was sharply criticised after the rising by several participants. By 14 April, the Jacobites had evacuated Nairn, and Cumberland's army camped at Balblair just west of the town.<ref name=\"SR-5156\">Reid (2002), pp. 51\u201356.</ref>\n\nSeveral significant Jacobite units were still ''en route'' or engaged far to the north, but on learning of the government advance their main army of about 5,400 left its base at [[Inverness]] and assembled 5&nbsp;miles (8&nbsp;km) to the east.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=57.5566&lon=-3.9597&scale=200000&icon=x|title=Map of Drummossie | publisher = MultiMap}}</ref> The Jacobite leadership was divided on whether to give battle or abandon Inverness but with supplies running out and most of their remaining stores and oatmeal held in the town, few options were left.<ref>Pittock (2016), p.58</ref> The Jacobite adjutant-general, [[Sir John O'Sullivan|John O'Sullivan]], identified a suitable site for a defensive action at Drummossie Moor,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=57.4779&lon=-4.0863&scale=100000&icon=x|title=Map of Drummossie Moor | publisher = MultiMap}}</ref> a stretch of open moorland between the walled [[Culloden, Scotland|Culloden Park]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=57.49&lon=-4.1356&scale=100000&icon=x|title=Map of Culloden | publisher = MultiMap}}</ref> enclosures to the north and those of Culwhiniac to the south.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Ordnance Survey | place = UK | url = http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=g&gazString=NH7417645057 | title = Get map}}.</ref>\n\nJacobite lieutenant-general [[Lord George Murray (general)|Lord George Murray]] \"did not like the ground\", as it was relatively flat and open, suggesting an alternative, steeply sloping site near [[Daviot Castle]].

In support of Perth, Lord John Drummond and Charles would bring up the second line. The Jacobite force, however, started out well after dark, partly due to concerns they would be spotted by ships of the Royal Navy then in the [[Moray Firth]]. Murray led them across country with the intention of avoiding government outposts: Murray's one time ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', James [[Chevalier de Johnstone]] later wrote, \"this march across country in a dark night which did not allow us to follow any track [was] accompanied with confusion and disorder\".<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\"/>\n\nBy the time the leading troop had reached Culraick, still {{convert|2|mi|km}} from where Murray's wing was to cross the River Nairn and encircle the town, there was only one hour left before dawn. After a heated council with other officers, Murray concluded that there was not enough time to mount a surprise attack and that the offensive should be aborted. Sullivan went to inform Charles Edward Stuart of the change of plan, but missed him in the dark. Meanwhile, instead of retracing his path back, Murray led his men left, down the Inverness road. In the darkness, while Murray led one-third of the Jacobite forces back to camp, the other two-thirds continued towards their original objective, unaware of the change in plan. One account of that night even records that Perth's men made contact with government troops before realising the rest of the Jacobite force had turned home. A few historians, such as [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] and [[Christopher Duffy]], have suggested that if Perth had carried on the night attack might have remained viable, though most have disagreed, as perhaps only 1200 of the Jacobite force accompanied him.<ref>Britain as a military power 1688\u20131815 (1999), p. 32</ref><ref>Black,Jeremy, Culloden and the '45 (1990)</ref><ref>Pittock (2016) p.67</ref>\n\nNot long after the exhausted Jacobite forces had made it back to Culloden, an officer of Lochiel's regiment, who had been left behind after falling asleep in a wood, arrived with a report of advancing government troops.<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\">Reid (2002), pp. 56\u201358.</ref> By then, many Jacobite soldiers had dispersed in search of food or returned to Inverness, while others were asleep in ditches and outbuildings; several hundred of their army may have missed the battle.\n\n==Battle on Culloden Moor==\n[[File:Battle of Culloden (map 02).svg|thumb|right|200px|Battle lines at Culloden, including initial redeployments by both Charles and Cumberland]]\n\n[[File:Culloden House (old).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Culloden House, 1746 where the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart had his headquarters and lodgings in the days leading up to the Battle of Culloden]]\n\nFollowing the abortive night attack, the Jacobites formed up in substantially the same battle order as the previous day, with the Highland regiments forming the first line. They faced north-east over common grazing land, with the [[River Nairn|Water of Nairn]] about 1 km to their right.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.69</ref> Their left wing, anchored on the Culloden Park walls, was under the command of the titular Duke of Perth, James Drummond; his brother John Drummond commanded the centre. The right wing, flanked by the Culwhiniac enclosure walls, was led by Murray. Behind them the 'Low Country' regiments were drawn up in column, in accordance with French practice. During the morning snow and hail \"started falling very thick\" onto the already wet ground, later turning to rain, though the weather turned fair as the battle started.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.65</ref>\n\nCumberland's army had pitched camp and were underway by {{nowrap|5 am,}} leaving the main Inverness road and marching across country. By {{nowrap|10 am}} the Jacobites finally saw them approaching at a distance of around {{nowrap|4 km;}} at {{nowrap|3 km}} from the Jacobite position Cumberland gave the order to form line, and the army marched forward in full battle order.<ref name=pittock79>Pittock (2016) p.79</ref> John Daniel, an Englishman serving with Charles's army, recorded that on seeing the government troops the Jacobites began to \"huzza and bravado them\", though without response: \"on the contrary, they continued proceding, like a deep sullen river\".<ref name=blaikie213>{{cite book |last=Blaikie |first=Walter |title=Origins of the Forty-Five |publisher=Scottish History Society|date=1916 |page=213}}</ref> Once within 500 metres, Cumberland moved his artillery up through the ranks.<ref name=pittock79/>\n\nAs Cumberland's forces formed into line of battle, it became clear that their right flank was in an exposed position and Cumberland moved up additional cavalry and other units to reinforce it.<ref name=pittock83>Pittock (2016) p.83</ref> In the Jacobite lines, Sullivan moved two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's regiment to cover the walls at Culwhiniac against a possible flank attack by government dragoons. Murray also moved the Jacobite right slightly forwards: this \"changement\", as Sullivan called it, had the unintended result of skewing the Jacobite line and opening gaps, so Sullivan ordered Perth and [[John Gordon of Glenbucket|Glenbucket]]'s regiments from the second line to the left of the front rank, and the Edinburgh Regiment to the centre. While the Jacobite front rank now substantially outnumbered that of Cumberland, their reserve was further depleted, increasing their reliance on the first line attack.<ref name=pittock85>Pittock (2016) p.85</ref>\n\n===Artillery exchange===\n\nAt approximately 1 p.m. Finlayson's Jacobite batteries opened fire, possibly in response to Cumberland sending forward [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|Lord Bury]] to within 100 metres of the Jacobite lines to \"ascertain the strength of their battery\".<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref> The government artillery responded shortly afterwards: while some later Jacobite memoirs suggest their troops were then subjected to artillery bombardment for 30 minutes or more while Charles delayed an advance, government accounts suggest a much shorter exchange before the Jacobites attacked. Campbell of Airds, in the rear, timed it at 9; Cumberland's aide-de-camp Yorke suggested only 2 or 3 minutes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\nThe duration implies that the government artillery are unlikely to have fired more than thirty rounds at extreme range: statistical analysis concludes that this would have caused only 20-30 Jacobite casualties at this stage, rather than the hundreds suggested by some accounts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\n===Jacobite advance===\n\nShortly after 1 pm, Charles issued an order to advance, which Col. Harry Kerr of Graden first took to Perth's regiment, on the extreme left. He then rode down the Jacobite line giving orders to each regiment in turn; [[Seven Men of Moidart#Sir John MacDonald|Sir John MacDonald]] and Brigadier Stapleton were also sent forward to repeat the order.<ref name=pittock87>Pittock (2016) p.87</ref> As the Jacobites left their lines, the government gunners switched to canister; this was augmented by fire from the coehorn mortars situated behind the government front line. As there was no need for careful aiming when using canister the rate of fire increased dramatically, and the Jacobites found themselves advancing into heavy fire.<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref>\n\nOn the Jacobite right, the Atholl Brigade, Lochiel's and the Appin Regiment left their start positions and charged towards Barrell's and Munro's regiments. Within a few hundred yards, however, the centre regiments, Lady Mackintosh's and Lovat's, had begun to swerve rightwards, either trying to avoid canister fire or in order to follow the firmer ground along the road running diagonally across Drummossie Moor. The five regiments became entangled as a single mass, converging on the government left. The confusion was worsened when the three largest regiments lost their commanding officers, who were all at the front of the advance: MacGillivray and MacBean of Lady Mackintosh's both went down; Inverallochie of Lovat's fell, and Lochiel had his ankles broken by canister within a few yards of the government lines.\n\nThe Jacobite left, by contrast, advanced much more slowly, hampered by boggy ground and by having several hundred yards further to cover. According to the account of [[Andrew Henderson (writer)|Andrew Henderson]], Lord John Drummond walked across the front of the Jacobite lines to try and tempt the government infantry into firing early, but they maintained their discipline. The three MacDonald regiments - Keppoch's, Clanranald's and Glengarry's - stalled before resorting to ineffectual long-range musket fire; they also lost senior officers, as Clanranald was wounded and Keppoch killed. The smaller units on their right - Maclachlan's Regiment and Chisholm's and Monaltrie's battalions - advanced into an area swept by artillery fire, and suffered heavy losses before falling back.\n\n===Engagement of government left wing===\n[[File:The Well of the Dead, Culloden Moor - geograph.org.uk - 494157.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Well of the Dead; modern remains of the park wall on Jacobite right]]\nThe Jacobite right was particularly hard hit by a volley from the government regiments at nearly point blank range, but many of its men still reached the government lines and, for the first time, a battle was decided by a direct clash between [[Highland charge|charging Highlanders]] and formed infantry equipped with muskets and socket bayonets. The brunt of the Jacobite impact, led by Lochiel's regiment, was taken by just two government regiments \u2013 [[4th Regiment of Foot|Barrell's 4th Foot]] and [[37th Regiment of Foot|Dejean's 37th Foot]]. Barrell's lost 17 and suffered 108 wounded, out of a total of 373 officers and men. Dejean's lost 14 and had 68 wounded, with this unit's left wing taking a disproportionately higher number of casualties. Barrell's regiment temporarily lost one of its two [[Regimental colours|colours]].{{refn|An unknown British Army corporal's description of the charge into the government's left wing: \"When we saw them coming towards us in great Haste and Fury, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall<!--does the original really say this twice?-->; notwithstanding which, they were so numerous, that they still advanced, and were almost upon us before we had loaden again.

The boggy ground, however, impeded the cavalry and they turned to engage the Irish Picquets whom Sullivan and Lord John Drummond had brought up in an attempt to stabilise the deteriorating Jacobite left flank. Cumberland later wrote: \"They came running on in their wild manner, and upon the right where I had place myself, imagining the greatest push would be there, they came down there several times within a hundred yards of our men, firing their pistols and brandishing their swords, but the Royal Scots and Pulteneys hardly took their fire-locks from their shoulders, so that after those faint attempts they made off; and the little squadrons on our right were sent to pursue them\".<ref name=\"Roberts 2002, p. 173\">Roberts (2002), p. 173.</ref><ref>Reid (2002), pp. 72\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Jacobite collapse and rout===\nWith the collapse of the left wing, Murray brought up the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards who were still at this time unengaged, but by the time they had been brought into position, the Jacobite first line was in [[rout]]. The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' exchanged musket fire with [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Campbell's 21st]] and commenced an orderly retreat, moving along the Culwhiniac enclosure in order to shield themselves from artillery fire. Immediately the half battalion of Highland militia, commanded by Captain Colin Campbell of Ballimore, which had stood inside the enclosure ambushed them. In the encounter Campbell of Ballimore was killed along with five of his men. The result was that the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards were forced out into the open moor and were engaged by three squadrons of Kerr's 11th Dragoons: the fleeing Jacobites must have put up a fight, for Kerr's 11th recorded at least 16 horses killed during the entirety of the battle.\n\nThe Irish Picquets under Stapleton bravely covered the Highlanders' retreat from the battlefield, preventing a massacre: this action cost half of the 100 casualties they suffered in the battle.<ref>McGarry, ''Irish Brigades Abroad'' p. 122</ref> The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' appear to have retired from the field in two wings; one part surrendered after suffering 50 killed or wounded, but their colours were not taken and a large number retired from the field with the Jacobite Lowland regiments.<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> A few Highland regiments also withdrew in good order, notably Lovat's first battalion who retired with colours flying; the government dragoons let them withdraw rather than risk a confrontation.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.95</ref>\n[[File:Jacobite standard (no9).svg|thumb|One of at least fourteen [[Historical colours, standards and guidons|standards or colours]] recorded as captured by government forces at the battle.<ref>Reid (2006), p. 16.</ref> This and a similar blue [[saltire]] may have been used by the Atholl Brigade.<ref>Reid (2002), p. 93.</ref>]]\nThe stand by the French regulars gave Charles and other senior officers time to escape. Charles seems to have been rallying Perth's and Glenbucket's regiments when Sullivan rode up to Captain Shea, commander of his bodyguard: \"Yu see all is going to pot. Yu can be of no great succor, so before a general deroute wch will soon be, Seize upon the Prince & take him off&nbsp;...\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> Contrary to government depictions of Charles as a coward, he yelled \"they won't take me alive!\" and called for a final charge into the government lines:<ref>Pittock (2016) p.134</ref> Shea however followed Sullivan's advice and led Charles from the field, accompanied by Perth and Glenbucket's regiments.\n\nFrom this point on the fleeing Jacobite forces were split into several groups: the Lowland regiments retired in order southwards, making their way to [[Ruthven Barracks]], while the remains of the Jacobite right wing also retired to the south. The MacDonald and other Highland left wing regiments however were cut off by the government cavalry, and forced to retreat down the road to Inverness. The result was that they were a clear target for government dragoons: Major-general [[Humphrey Bland]] led the pursuit of the fleeing Highlanders, giving \"[[no quarter|Quarter to None]] but about Fifty French Officers and Soldiers\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\">Reid (2002), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\n===Conclusion: casualties and prisoners===\nJacobite [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] are estimated at 1,500\u20132,000 killed or wounded, with many of these occurring in the pursuit after the battle.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> Cumberland's official list of prisoners taken includes 154 Jacobites and 222 \"French\" prisoners (men from the 'foreign units' in the French service). Added to the official list of those apprehended were 172 of the Earl of Cromartie's men, captured after a [[Battle of Littleferry|brief engagement the day before]] near [[Littleferry]].\n\nIn striking contrast to the Jacobite losses, the government losses were 50 dead and 259 wounded. However, a large proportion of those recorded as wounded are likely to have died of their wounds: only 29 out of 104 wounded from Barrell's 4th Foot survived to claim pensions, while all 6 of the artillerymen recorded as wounded died.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/>\n\nSeveral senior Jacobites were casualties including [[Alexander Macdonald, 17th of Keppoch|Keppoch]], [[William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan|Viscount Strathallan]], commissary-general Lachlan Maclachlan and Walter Stapleton, who died of wounds shortly after the battle. Others, including [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock|Kilmarnock]], were captured. The only government casualty of high rank was [[Lord Robert Kerr]], the son of [[William Kerr, 3rd Marquess of Lothian]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:\"The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion\".jpg|thumb|left|''The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion'' depicts the retreat of the defeated [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].]]\n\n===Collapse of the Jacobite campaign===\nAs the first of the fleeing Highlanders approached Inverness they were met by the 2nd battalion of Lovat's regiment, led by the [[Simon Fraser of Lovat|Master of Lovat]]. It has been suggested that Lovat shrewdly switched sides and turned upon the retreating Jacobites, an act that would explain his remarkable rise in fortune in the years that followed.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\">Reid (2002), pp. 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nFollowing the battle, the Jacobites' Lowland regiments headed south, towards Corrybrough and made their way to Ruthven Barracks, while their Highland units made their way north, towards Inverness and on through to Fort Augustus. There they were joined by Barisdale's battalion of Glengarry's regiment and a small battalion of MacGregors.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> At least two of those present at Ruthven, James Johnstone and John Daniel, recorded that the Highland troops remained in good spirits despite the defeat and eager to resume the campaign. At this point, continuing Jacobite resistance remained potentially viable in terms of manpower: at least a third of the army had either missed or slept through Culloden, which along with survivors from the battle gave a potential force of 5-6000 men.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', p.25</ref> However the roughly 1,500 men who assembled at Ruthven Barracks received orders from Charles to the effect that the army should disperse until he returned with French support.<ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\">Roberts (2002), pp. 182\u201383.</ref>\n\nSimilar orders must have been received by the Highland units at Fort Augustus, and by 18 April the majority of the Jacobite army was disbanded. Officers and men of the units in French service made for Inverness, where they surrendered as prisoners of war on 19 April. Most of the rest of the army broke up, with men heading for home or attempting to escape abroad,<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> although the Appin Regiment amongst others was still in arms as late as July.\n\n{{see also|Skirmish of Loch nan Uamh}}\n\nMany senior Jacobites made their way to {{lang|gd|[[Loch nan Uamh]]}}, where Charles Edward Stuart had first landed at the outset of the campaign in 1745. Here on 30 April they were met by two French [[frigate]]s \u2013 the [[French privateer Mars (1746)|''Mars'']] and [[French privateer Bellone (1745)|''Bellone'']]. Two days later the French ships were spotted and attacked by three smaller [[Royal Navy]] [[sloops]] \u2013 the ''[[HMS Greyhound (1741)|Greyhound]]'', [[HMS Baltimore (1742)|''Baltimore'']], and ''[[HMS Terror (1741)|Terror]]''. The result was the last real engagement of the campaign; during the six hours in which the battle continued the Jacobites recovered cargo which had been landed by the French ships, including [[pounds sterling|\u00a3]]35,000 of gold.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/>\n\nWith visible proof that the French had not deserted them, a group of Jacobite leaders attempted to prolong the campaign. On 8 May, nearby at [[Murlaggan]], Lochiel, Lochgarry, Clanranald and Barisdale all agreed to rendezvous at Invermallie on 18 May, as did [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and his son. The plan was that there they would be joined by what remained of Keppoch's men and Macpherson of Cluny's regiment, which had not taken part in the battle at Culloden. However, things did not go as planned; after about a month of relative inactivity, Cumberland moved his army into the Highlands and on 17 May three battalions of regulars and eight Highland companies reoccupied Fort Augustus. The same day, the Macphersons surrendered. On the day of the planned rendezvous, Clanranald never appeared and Lochgarry and Barisdale only showed up with about 300 combined, most of whom immediately dispersed in search of food: Lochiel, who commanded possibly the strongest Jacobite regiment at Culloden, was only able to muster 300 men. The group dispersed, and the following week the Government launched [[raids on Lochaber and Shiramore|punitive expeditions into the Highlands which continued throughout the summer]].<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/><ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\"/>\n\nFollowing his flight from the battle, Charles Edward Stuart made his way towards the [[Hebrides]], accompanied by a small group of supporters. By 20 April, Charles had reached {{lang|gd|[[Arisaig]]}} on the west coast of Scotland.

Interesting finds have been made in the areas where the fiercest fighting occurred on the government left wing, particularly where Barrell's and Dejean's regiments stood. For example, pistol balls and pieces of shattered muskets have been uncovered here which indicate close quarters fighting, as pistols were only used at close range and the musket pieces appear to have been smashed by pistol/musket balls or heavy broadswords. Finds of musket balls appear to mirror the lines of men who stood and fought. Some balls appear to have been dropped without being fired, some missed their targets, and others are distorted from hitting human bodies. In some cases it may be possible to identify whether the Jacobites or government soldiers fired certain rounds, because the Jacobite forces are known to have used a large quantity of French muskets which fired a slightly smaller [[caliber|calibre]] shot than that of the British Army's ''[[Brown Bess]]''. Analysis of the finds confirms that the Jacobites used muskets in greater numbers than has traditionally been thought. Not far from where the hand-to-hand fighting took place, fragments of mortar shells have been found.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/battlefieldarchaeology/centreprojects/culloden/|title=Point of Contact: Archaeology at Culloden|accessdate=6 March 2009|work=University of Glasgow Centre for Battlefield Archaeology}}</ref> Though Forbes's headstones mark the graves of the Jacobites, the location of the graves of about sixty government soldiers is unknown. The recent discovery of a 1752 silver ''[[Thaler]]'', from the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], may however lead archaeologists to these graves. A geophysical survey, directly beneath the spot where the coin was found, seems to indicate the existence of a large rectangular burial pit. It is thought possible that the coin was dropped by a soldier who once served on the continent, while he visited the graves of his fallen comrades.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\"/>\nThe National Trust of Scotland is currently attempting to restore Culloden Moor, as closely as possible, to the state it was in during the Battle of Culloden Moor.

On 16 April 1746, the [[Jacobite Army (1745)|Jacobite army]] of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] was decisively defeated by a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government force under [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], on Drummossie Moor near [[Inverness]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. It was the last [[pitched battle]] fought on British soil.\n\nCharles was the eldest son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the exiled [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] claimant to the British throne. Believing there was support for a Stuart restoration in both Scotland and England, he landed in Scotland in July 1745:  raising an army of Scots [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters, he took [[Edinburgh]] by September and defeated a British government force at [[Battle of Prestonpans|Prestonpans]]. The government recalled 12,000 troops from the Continent to deal with the rising: a Jacobite invasion of England reached as far as [[Derby]] before turning back, having attracted relatively few English recruits.\n\nThe Jacobites, with limited French military support, attempted to consolidate their control of Scotland, where by early 1746 they were opposed by a substantial government army. A scrambled Jacobite victory at [[Battle of Falkirk Muir|Falkirk]] failed to change the strategic situation: with supplies and pay running short and with the government troops resupplied and reorganised under the Duke of Cumberland, son of British monarch [[George II of England|George&nbsp;II]], the Jacobite leadership had few options left other than to stand and fight. The two armies eventually met at Culloden, on terrain that gave Cumberland's larger, well-rested force the advantage. The battle lasted only an hour, with the Jacobites suffering a bloody defeat; between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites were killed or wounded,<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> while about 300 government soldiers were killed or wounded.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/> While perhaps 5-6,000 Jacobites remained in arms in Scotland, the leadership took the decision to disperse, effectively ending the rising.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron. (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', pp.23-25</ref>\n\nCulloden and its aftermath continue to arouse strong feelings. The [[University of Glasgow]] awarded the Duke of Cumberland an honorary doctorate, but many modern commentators allege that the aftermath of the battle and subsequent crackdown on Jacobite sympathisers were brutal, earning Cumberland the [[sobriquet]] \"Butcher\". Efforts were subsequently made to further integrate the comparatively undeveloped [[Scottish Highlands]] into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; civil penalties were introduced to undermine the [[Scottish clan]] system, which had provided the Jacobites with the means to rapidly mobilise an army.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Jacobite rising of 1745}}\n[[File:Lost Portrait of Charles Edward Stuart.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Charles Stuart at Holyrood, 1745|The [[lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart]], painted at Edinburgh in late 1745]]\n[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|alt=William, Duke of Cumberland|upright|Charles' dynastic and military opponent, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], ca 1757]]\n[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], died in 1714, with no living children. Under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], she was succeeded by her [[second cousin]] [[George I of Great Britain|George&nbsp;I]] of the [[House of Hanover]], who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], a daughter of [[James VI and I]]. Many, however, particularly in Scotland and Ireland, continued to support the claim to the throne of Anne's exiled half-brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]], excluded from the succession under the Act of Settlement due to his [[Roman Catholic]] religion.\n\nOn 23 July 1745 James's son [[Charles Edward Stuart]] landed on [[Eriskay]] in the Western Islands in an attempt to reclaim the throne of Great Britain for his father, accompanied only by the \"[[Seven Men of Moidart]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Roderick |title=Bonnie Prince Charlie: Truth or Lies |date=2014 |isbn=978-0861537839 |page=2 |publisher=St Andrew Press}}</ref> Most of his Scottish supporters advised he return to France, but his persuasion of [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel]] to back him encouraged others to commit and the rebellion was launched at [[Glenfinnan]] on 19 August.

This assumed limited, short-term warfare: a long campaign demanded greater professionalism and training, and the colonels of some Highland regiments considered their men to be uncontrollable.<ref name=\"Harrington(2006)-35-40\">Harrington (1991), pp. 35\u201340.</ref>{{refn|Colonel John William Sullivan wrote, \"All was confused&nbsp;... such a chiefe of a tribe had sixty men, another thiry, another twenty, more or lesse; they would not mix nor seperat, & wou'd have double officers, yt is two Captns & two Lts, to each Compagny, strong or weak&nbsp;... but by little, were brought into a certain regulation\".<ref>Reid (2006), pp. 20\u201321.</ref>|group=note}} A typical 'clan' regiment was officered by the heavily-armed [[tacksman|tacksmen]], with their subtenants acting as common soldiers.<ref name=\"Reid(1997)-p58\"/><ref name=\"Barthorp(1982)-p17-18\">Barthorp, Michael (1982).

Around 500 men from the Irish Brigade fought in the battle, around 100 of whom were thought to have been recruited from [[6th Regiment of Foot|6th (Guise's) Foot]] taken prisoner at Fort Augustus.

On 6 September 1745, every recruit who joined the Guards before 24 September was given \u00a36, and those who joined in the last days of the month were given \u00a34.

In support of Perth, Lord John Drummond and Charles would bring up the second line. The Jacobite force, however, started out well after dark, partly due to concerns they would be spotted by ships of the Royal Navy then in the [[Moray Firth]]. Murray led them across country with the intention of avoiding government outposts: Murray's one time ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', James [[Chevalier de Johnstone]] later wrote, \"this march across country in a dark night which did not allow us to follow any track [was] accompanied with confusion and disorder\".<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\"/>\n\nBy the time the leading troop had reached Culraick, still {{convert|2|mi|km}} from where Murray's wing was to cross the River Nairn and encircle the town, there was only one hour left before dawn. After a heated council with other officers, Murray concluded that there was not enough time to mount a surprise attack and that the offensive should be aborted. Sullivan went to inform Charles Edward Stuart of the change of plan, but missed him in the dark. Meanwhile, instead of retracing his path back, Murray led his men left, down the Inverness road. In the darkness, while Murray led one-third of the Jacobite forces back to camp, the other two-thirds continued towards their original objective, unaware of the change in plan. One account of that night even records that Perth's men made contact with government troops before realising the rest of the Jacobite force had turned home. A few historians, such as [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] and [[Christopher Duffy]], have suggested that if Perth had carried on the night attack might have remained viable, though most have disagreed, as perhaps only 1200 of the Jacobite force accompanied him.<ref>Britain as a military power 1688\u20131815 (1999), p. 32</ref><ref>Black,Jeremy, Culloden and the '45 (1990)</ref><ref>Pittock (2016) p.67</ref>\n\nNot long after the exhausted Jacobite forces had made it back to Culloden, an officer of Lochiel's regiment, who had been left behind after falling asleep in a wood, arrived with a report of advancing government troops.<ref name=\"SR2006-5658\">Reid (2002), pp. 56\u201358.</ref> By then, many Jacobite soldiers had dispersed in search of food or returned to Inverness, while others were asleep in ditches and outbuildings; several hundred of their army may have missed the battle.\n\n==Battle on Culloden Moor==\n[[File:Battle of Culloden (map 02).svg|thumb|right|200px|Battle lines at Culloden, including initial redeployments by both Charles and Cumberland]]\n\n[[File:Culloden House (old).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Culloden House, 1746 where the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart had his headquarters and lodgings in the days leading up to the Battle of Culloden]]\n\nFollowing the abortive night attack, the Jacobites formed up in substantially the same battle order as the previous day, with the Highland regiments forming the first line. They faced north-east over common grazing land, with the [[River Nairn|Water of Nairn]] about 1 km to their right.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.69</ref> Their left wing, anchored on the Culloden Park walls, was under the command of the titular Duke of Perth, James Drummond; his brother John Drummond commanded the centre. The right wing, flanked by the Culwhiniac enclosure walls, was led by Murray. Behind them the 'Low Country' regiments were drawn up in column, in accordance with French practice. During the morning snow and hail \"started falling very thick\" onto the already wet ground, later turning to rain, though the weather turned fair as the battle started.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.65</ref>\n\nCumberland's army had pitched camp and were underway by {{nowrap|5 am,}} leaving the main Inverness road and marching across country. By {{nowrap|10 am}} the Jacobites finally saw them approaching at a distance of around {{nowrap|4 km;}} at {{nowrap|3 km}} from the Jacobite position Cumberland gave the order to form line, and the army marched forward in full battle order.<ref name=pittock79>Pittock (2016) p.79</ref> John Daniel, an Englishman serving with Charles's army, recorded that on seeing the government troops the Jacobites began to \"huzza and bravado them\", though without response: \"on the contrary, they continued proceding, like a deep sullen river\".<ref name=blaikie213>{{cite book |last=Blaikie |first=Walter |title=Origins of the Forty-Five |publisher=Scottish History Society|date=1916 |page=213}}</ref> Once within 500 metres, Cumberland moved his artillery up through the ranks.<ref name=pittock79/>\n\nAs Cumberland's forces formed into line of battle, it became clear that their right flank was in an exposed position and Cumberland moved up additional cavalry and other units to reinforce it.<ref name=pittock83>Pittock (2016) p.83</ref> In the Jacobite lines, Sullivan moved two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's regiment to cover the walls at Culwhiniac against a possible flank attack by government dragoons. Murray also moved the Jacobite right slightly forwards: this \"changement\", as Sullivan called it, had the unintended result of skewing the Jacobite line and opening gaps, so Sullivan ordered Perth and [[John Gordon of Glenbucket|Glenbucket]]'s regiments from the second line to the left of the front rank, and the Edinburgh Regiment to the centre. While the Jacobite front rank now substantially outnumbered that of Cumberland, their reserve was further depleted, increasing their reliance on the first line attack.<ref name=pittock85>Pittock (2016) p.85</ref>\n\n===Artillery exchange===\n\nAt approximately 1 p.m. Finlayson's Jacobite batteries opened fire, possibly in response to Cumberland sending forward [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|Lord Bury]] to within 100 metres of the Jacobite lines to \"ascertain the strength of their battery\".<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref> The government artillery responded shortly afterwards: while some later Jacobite memoirs suggest their troops were then subjected to artillery bombardment for 30 minutes or more while Charles delayed an advance, government accounts suggest a much shorter exchange before the Jacobites attacked. Campbell of Airds, in the rear, timed it at 9; Cumberland's aide-de-camp Yorke suggested only 2 or 3 minutes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\nThe duration implies that the government artillery are unlikely to have fired more than thirty rounds at extreme range: statistical analysis concludes that this would have caused only 20-30 Jacobite casualties at this stage, rather than the hundreds suggested by some accounts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Tony (ed) |title=Culloden |publisher=Pen and Sword (Kindle ed)|date=2009 |page=loc. 2128}}</ref>\n\n===Jacobite advance===\n\nShortly after 1 pm, Charles issued an order to advance, which Col. Harry Kerr of Graden first took to Perth's regiment, on the extreme left. He then rode down the Jacobite line giving orders to each regiment in turn; [[Seven Men of Moidart#Sir John MacDonald|Sir John MacDonald]] and Brigadier Stapleton were also sent forward to repeat the order.<ref name=pittock87>Pittock (2016) p.87</ref> As the Jacobites left their lines, the government gunners switched to canister; this was augmented by fire from the coehorn mortars situated behind the government front line. As there was no need for careful aiming when using canister the rate of fire increased dramatically, and the Jacobites found themselves advancing into heavy fire.<ref name=pittock86>Pittock (2016) p.86</ref>\n\nOn the Jacobite right, the Atholl Brigade, Lochiel's and the Appin Regiment left their start positions and charged towards Barrell's and Munro's regiments. Within a few hundred yards, however, the centre regiments, Lady Mackintosh's and Lovat's, had begun to swerve rightwards, either trying to avoid canister fire or in order to follow the firmer ground along the road running diagonally across Drummossie Moor. The five regiments became entangled as a single mass, converging on the government left. The confusion was worsened when the three largest regiments lost their commanding officers, who were all at the front of the advance: MacGillivray and MacBean of Lady Mackintosh's both went down; Inverallochie of Lovat's fell, and Lochiel had his ankles broken by canister within a few yards of the government lines.\n\nThe Jacobite left, by contrast, advanced much more slowly, hampered by boggy ground and by having several hundred yards further to cover. According to the account of [[Andrew Henderson (writer)|Andrew Henderson]], Lord John Drummond walked across the front of the Jacobite lines to try and tempt the government infantry into firing early, but they maintained their discipline. The three MacDonald regiments - Keppoch's, Clanranald's and Glengarry's - stalled before resorting to ineffectual long-range musket fire; they also lost senior officers, as Clanranald was wounded and Keppoch killed. The smaller units on their right - Maclachlan's Regiment and Chisholm's and Monaltrie's battalions - advanced into an area swept by artillery fire, and suffered heavy losses before falling back.\n\n===Engagement of government left wing===\n[[File:The Well of the Dead, Culloden Moor - geograph.org.uk - 494157.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Well of the Dead; modern remains of the park wall on Jacobite right]]\nThe Jacobite right was particularly hard hit by a volley from the government regiments at nearly point blank range, but many of its men still reached the government lines and, for the first time, a battle was decided by a direct clash between [[Highland charge|charging Highlanders]] and formed infantry equipped with muskets and socket bayonets. The brunt of the Jacobite impact, led by Lochiel's regiment, was taken by just two government regiments \u2013 [[4th Regiment of Foot|Barrell's 4th Foot]] and [[37th Regiment of Foot|Dejean's 37th Foot]]. Barrell's lost 17 and suffered 108 wounded, out of a total of 373 officers and men. Dejean's lost 14 and had 68 wounded, with this unit's left wing taking a disproportionately higher number of casualties. Barrell's regiment temporarily lost one of its two [[Regimental colours|colours]].{{refn|An unknown British Army corporal's description of the charge into the government's left wing: \"When we saw them coming towards us in great Haste and Fury, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall, we fired at about 50&nbsp;Yards Distance, which made Hundreds fall<!--does the original really say this twice?-->; notwithstanding which, they were so numerous, that they still advanced, and were almost upon us before we had loaden again.

The boggy ground, however, impeded the cavalry and they turned to engage the Irish Picquets whom Sullivan and Lord John Drummond had brought up in an attempt to stabilise the deteriorating Jacobite left flank. Cumberland later wrote: \"They came running on in their wild manner, and upon the right where I had place myself, imagining the greatest push would be there, they came down there several times within a hundred yards of our men, firing their pistols and brandishing their swords, but the Royal Scots and Pulteneys hardly took their fire-locks from their shoulders, so that after those faint attempts they made off; and the little squadrons on our right were sent to pursue them\".<ref name=\"Roberts 2002, p. 173\">Roberts (2002), p. 173.</ref><ref>Reid (2002), pp. 72\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Jacobite collapse and rout===\nWith the collapse of the left wing, Murray brought up the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards who were still at this time unengaged, but by the time they had been brought into position, the Jacobite first line was in [[rout]]. The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' exchanged musket fire with [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Campbell's 21st]] and commenced an orderly retreat, moving along the Culwhiniac enclosure in order to shield themselves from artillery fire. Immediately the half battalion of Highland militia, commanded by Captain Colin Campbell of Ballimore, which had stood inside the enclosure ambushed them. In the encounter Campbell of Ballimore was killed along with five of his men. The result was that the ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' and Kilmarnock's Footguards were forced out into the open moor and were engaged by three squadrons of Kerr's 11th Dragoons: the fleeing Jacobites must have put up a fight, for Kerr's 11th recorded at least 16 horses killed during the entirety of the battle.\n\nThe Irish Picquets under Stapleton bravely covered the Highlanders' retreat from the battlefield, preventing a massacre: this action cost half of the 100 casualties they suffered in the battle.<ref>McGarry, ''Irish Brigades Abroad'' p. 122</ref> The ''Royal \u00c9cossais'' appear to have retired from the field in two wings; one part surrendered after suffering 50 killed or wounded, but their colours were not taken and a large number retired from the field with the Jacobite Lowland regiments.<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> A few Highland regiments also withdrew in good order, notably Lovat's first battalion who retired with colours flying; the government dragoons let them withdraw rather than risk a confrontation.<ref>Pittock (2016) p.95</ref>\n[[File:Jacobite standard (no9).svg|thumb|One of at least fourteen [[Historical colours, standards and guidons|standards or colours]] recorded as captured by government forces at the battle.<ref>Reid (2006), p. 16.</ref> This and a similar blue [[saltire]] may have been used by the Atholl Brigade.<ref>Reid (2002), p. 93.</ref>]]\nThe stand by the French regulars gave Charles and other senior officers time to escape. Charles seems to have been rallying Perth's and Glenbucket's regiments when Sullivan rode up to Captain Shea, commander of his bodyguard: \"Yu see all is going to pot. Yu can be of no great succor, so before a general deroute wch will soon be, Seize upon the Prince & take him off&nbsp;...\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\"/> Contrary to government depictions of Charles as a coward, he yelled \"they won't take me alive!\" and called for a final charge into the government lines:<ref>Pittock (2016) p.134</ref> Shea however followed Sullivan's advice and led Charles from the field, accompanied by Perth and Glenbucket's regiments.\n\nFrom this point on the fleeing Jacobite forces were split into several groups: the Lowland regiments retired in order southwards, making their way to [[Ruthven Barracks]], while the remains of the Jacobite right wing also retired to the south. The MacDonald and other Highland left wing regiments however were cut off by the government cavalry, and forced to retreat down the road to Inverness. The result was that they were a clear target for government dragoons: Major-general [[Humphrey Bland]] led the pursuit of the fleeing Highlanders, giving \"[[no quarter|Quarter to None]] but about Fifty French Officers and Soldiers\".<ref name=\"PH1991-8085\">Reid (2002), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\n===Conclusion: casualties and prisoners===\nJacobite [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] are estimated at 1,500\u20132,000 killed or wounded, with many of these occurring in the pursuit after the battle.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/><ref name=\"PH1991-83\"/> Cumberland's official list of prisoners taken includes 154 Jacobites and 222 \"French\" prisoners (men from the 'foreign units' in the French service). Added to the official list of those apprehended were 172 of the Earl of Cromartie's men, captured after a [[Battle of Littleferry|brief engagement the day before]] near [[Littleferry]].\n\nIn striking contrast to the Jacobite losses, the government losses were 50 dead and 259 wounded. However, a large proportion of those recorded as wounded are likely to have died of their wounds: only 29 out of 104 wounded from Barrell's 4th Foot survived to claim pensions, while all 6 of the artillerymen recorded as wounded died.<ref name=\"SR2002-8587\"/>\n\nSeveral senior Jacobites were casualties including [[Alexander Macdonald, 17th of Keppoch|Keppoch]], [[William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan|Viscount Strathallan]], commissary-general Lachlan Maclachlan and Walter Stapleton, who died of wounds shortly after the battle. Others, including [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock|Kilmarnock]], were captured. The only government casualty of high rank was [[Lord Robert Kerr]], the son of [[William Kerr, 3rd Marquess of Lothian]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:\"The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion\".jpg|thumb|left|''The End of the 'Forty Five' Rebellion'' depicts the retreat of the defeated [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].]]\n\n===Collapse of the Jacobite campaign===\nAs the first of the fleeing Highlanders approached Inverness they were met by the 2nd battalion of Lovat's regiment, led by the [[Simon Fraser of Lovat|Master of Lovat]]. It has been suggested that Lovat shrewdly switched sides and turned upon the retreating Jacobites, an act that would explain his remarkable rise in fortune in the years that followed.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\">Reid (2002), pp. 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nFollowing the battle, the Jacobites' Lowland regiments headed south, towards Corrybrough and made their way to Ruthven Barracks, while their Highland units made their way north, towards Inverness and on through to Fort Augustus. There they were joined by Barisdale's battalion of Glengarry's regiment and a small battalion of MacGregors.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> At least two of those present at Ruthven, James Johnstone and John Daniel, recorded that the Highland troops remained in good spirits despite the defeat and eager to resume the campaign. At this point, continuing Jacobite resistance remained potentially viable in terms of manpower: at least a third of the army had either missed or slept through Culloden, which along with survivors from the battle gave a potential force of 5-6000 men.<ref>Zimmerman, Doron (2003) ''The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759'', p.25</ref> However the roughly 1,500 men who assembled at Ruthven Barracks received orders from Charles to the effect that the army should disperse until he returned with French support.<ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\">Roberts (2002), pp. 182\u201383.</ref>\n\nSimilar orders must have been received by the Highland units at Fort Augustus, and by 18 April the majority of the Jacobite army was disbanded. Officers and men of the units in French service made for Inverness, where they surrendered as prisoners of war on 19 April. Most of the rest of the army broke up, with men heading for home or attempting to escape abroad,<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/> although the Appin Regiment amongst others was still in arms as late as July.\n\n{{see also|Skirmish of Loch nan Uamh}}\n\nMany senior Jacobites made their way to {{lang|gd|[[Loch nan Uamh]]}}, where Charles Edward Stuart had first landed at the outset of the campaign in 1745. Here on 30 April they were met by two French [[frigate]]s \u2013 the [[French privateer Mars (1746)|''Mars'']] and [[French privateer Bellone (1745)|''Bellone'']]. Two days later the French ships were spotted and attacked by three smaller [[Royal Navy]] [[sloops]] \u2013 the ''[[HMS Greyhound (1741)|Greyhound]]'', [[HMS Baltimore (1742)|''Baltimore'']], and ''[[HMS Terror (1741)|Terror]]''. The result was the last real engagement of the campaign; during the six hours in which the battle continued the Jacobites recovered cargo which had been landed by the French ships, including [[pounds sterling|\u00a3]]35,000 of gold.<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/>\n\nWith visible proof that the French had not deserted them, a group of Jacobite leaders attempted to prolong the campaign. On 8 May, nearby at [[Murlaggan]], Lochiel, Lochgarry, Clanranald and Barisdale all agreed to rendezvous at Invermallie on 18 May, as did [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and his son. The plan was that there they would be joined by what remained of Keppoch's men and Macpherson of Cluny's regiment, which had not taken part in the battle at Culloden. However, things did not go as planned; after about a month of relative inactivity, Cumberland moved his army into the Highlands and on 17 May three battalions of regulars and eight Highland companies reoccupied Fort Augustus. The same day, the Macphersons surrendered. On the day of the planned rendezvous, Clanranald never appeared and Lochgarry and Barisdale only showed up with about 300 combined, most of whom immediately dispersed in search of food: Lochiel, who commanded possibly the strongest Jacobite regiment at Culloden, was only able to muster 300 men. The group dispersed, and the following week the Government launched [[raids on Lochaber and Shiramore|punitive expeditions into the Highlands which continued throughout the summer]].<ref name=\"SR2002-8890\"/><ref name=\"JLR2002-182-183\"/>\n\nFollowing his flight from the battle, Charles Edward Stuart made his way towards the [[Hebrides]], accompanied by a small group of supporters. By 20 April, Charles had reached {{lang|gd|[[Arisaig]]}} on the west coast of Scotland. After spending a few days with his close associates, he sailed for the island of [[Benbecula]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. From there he travelled to [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides|Scalpay]], off the east coast of [[Harris (Scotland)|Harris]], and from there made his way to [[Stornoway]].<ref name=\"PH1991-8586\"/> For five months Charles criss-crossed the Hebrides, constantly pursued by government supporters and under threat from local [[laird]]s who were tempted to betray him for the \u00a330,000 upon his head.<ref name=\"JP1973-301\">Prebble (1973), p. 301.</ref> During this time he met [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora Macdonald]], who famously aided him in a narrow escape to [[Skye]].

In any event, Cumberland's order was not carried out for two days, after which contemporary accounts report then that for the next two days the moor was searched and all those wounded were put to death.

Interesting finds have been made in the areas where the fiercest fighting occurred on the government left wing, particularly where Barrell's and Dejean's regiments stood. For example, pistol balls and pieces of shattered muskets have been uncovered here which indicate close quarters fighting, as pistols were only used at close range and the musket pieces appear to have been smashed by pistol/musket balls or heavy broadswords. Finds of musket balls appear to mirror the lines of men who stood and fought. Some balls appear to have been dropped without being fired, some missed their targets, and others are distorted from hitting human bodies. In some cases it may be possible to identify whether the Jacobites or government soldiers fired certain rounds, because the Jacobite forces are known to have used a large quantity of French muskets which fired a slightly smaller [[caliber|calibre]] shot than that of the British Army's ''[[Brown Bess]]''. Analysis of the finds confirms that the Jacobites used muskets in greater numbers than has traditionally been thought. Not far from where the hand-to-hand fighting took place, fragments of mortar shells have been found.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/battlefieldarchaeology/centreprojects/culloden/|title=Point of Contact: Archaeology at Culloden|accessdate=6 March 2009|work=University of Glasgow Centre for Battlefield Archaeology}}</ref> Though Forbes's headstones mark the graves of the Jacobites, the location of the graves of about sixty government soldiers is unknown. The recent discovery of a 1752 silver ''[[Thaler]]'', from the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], may however lead archaeologists to these graves. A geophysical survey, directly beneath the spot where the coin was found, seems to indicate the existence of a large rectangular burial pit. It is thought possible that the coin was dropped by a soldier who once served on the continent, while he visited the graves of his fallen comrades.<ref name=\"gla.ac.uk-culloden\"/>\nThe National Trust of Scotland is currently attempting to restore Culloden Moor, as closely as possible, to the state it was in during the Battle of Culloden Moor.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

These include:\n**[[Chromosomal translocation]]s: interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.\n**[[Chromosomal inversion]]s: reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.\n** Non-homologous [[chromosomal crossover]].\n** Interstitial deletions: an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human [[astrocytoma]], a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes [[Carcinogenesis|oncogenic]] transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).\n*[[Loss of heterozygosity]]: loss of one [[allele]], either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles.\n\n==== Small-scale mutations ====\n\nSmall-scale mutations affect a gene in one or a few nucleotides. (If only a single nucleotide is affected, they are called [[point mutation]]s.) Small-scale mutations include:\n\n* [[Insertion (genetics)|Insertions]] add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by [[transposable element]]s, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] ([[splice site mutation]]), or cause a shift in the [[reading frame]] ([[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]]), both of which can significantly alter the [[gene product]]. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.\n* [[Deletion (genetics)|Deletions]] remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. In general, they are irreversible: Though exactly the same sequence might, in theory, be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1\u20132 bases) in ''any'' location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all.\n* [[Point mutation|Substitution mutations]], often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freese E | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 622\u201333 | date = April 1959 | pmid = 16590424 | pmc = 222607 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.45.4.622 | authorlink = Ernst Freese | bibcode = 1959PNAS...45..622F | title = The Difference Between Spontaneous and Base-Analogue Induced Mutations of Phage T4 }}</ref> These changes are classified as transitions or transversions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freese |first=Ernst | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 1959 |title=The specific mutagenic effect of base analogues on Phage T4 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87\u2013105 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(59)80038-3}}</ref> Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A \u2194 G) or a [[pyrimidine]] for a pyrimidine, (C \u2194 T). A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mispairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T \u2194 A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of [[adenine]] (A) into a cytosine (C). Point mutations are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). As discussed [[#By_impact_on_protein_sequence|below]], point mutations that occur within the protein [[coding region]] of a gene may be classified as [[Synonymous substitution|synonymous]] or [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s, the latter of which in turn can be divided into [[Missense mutation|missense]] or [[nonsense mutations]].\n\n=== By impact on protein sequence ===\n\n*A [[frameshift mutation]] is a mutation caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from the original.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hogan|first=C.

(For example, the code CCU GAC UAC CUA codes for the amino acids proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, and leucine. If the U in CCU was deleted, the resulting sequence would be CCG ACU ACC UAx, which would instead code for proline, threonine, threonine, and part of another amino acid or perhaps a [[stop codon]] (where the x stands for the following nucleotide).) By contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an ''in-frame mutation''.\n*A point substitution mutation results in a change in a single nucleotide and can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous.\n**A [[synonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for the same amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Synonymous mutations occur due to the [[Degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] nature of the [[genetic code]]. If this mutation does not result in any phenotypic effects, then it is called [[Silent mutation|silent]], but not all synonymous substitutions are silent. (There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial as it is in the coding regions, but these are not considered synonymous substitutions.)\n**A [[nonsynonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for a different amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is modified. Nonsynonymous substitutions can be classified as nonsense or missense mutations:\n***A [[missense mutation]] changes a nucleotide to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]], [[sickle-cell disease]], and [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD1]]-mediated [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Boill\u00e9e S, Vande Velde C, Cleveland DW|date=October 2006|title=ALS: a disease of motor neurons and their nonneuronal neighbors|journal=Neuron|volume=52|issue=1|pages=39\u201359|citeseerx=10.1.1.325.7514|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.018|pmid=17015226}}</ref> On the other hand, if a missense mutation occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid, then sometimes little or no change is rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode [[arginine]], a chemically similar molecule to the intended [[lysine]]. In this latter case the mutation will have little or no effect on phenotype and therefore be [[neutral mutation|neutral]].\n***A [[nonsense mutation]] is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a ''nonsense codon'' in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. This sort of mutation has been linked to different mutations, such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. (See [[Stop codon]].)\n\n===By effect on function===\n\n* Loss-of-function mutations, also called inactivating mutations, result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function ([[null allele]]), it is often called an [[amorph (gene)|amorph]] or amorphic mutation in the [[Muller's morphs]] schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]. Exceptions are when the organism is [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called [[haploinsufficiency]]).\n* Gain-of-function mutations, also called activating mutations, change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function. When the new allele is created, a [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygote]] containing the newly created allele as well as the original will express the new allele; genetically this defines the mutations as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] phenotypes. Several of Muller's morphs correspond to gain of function, including hypermorph (increased gene expression) and neomorph (novel function). In December 2017, the U.S. government lifted a temporary ban implemented in 2014 that banned federal funding for any new \"gain-of-function\" experiments that enhance pathogens \"such as Avian influenza, SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS viruses.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/news/articles/2017-12-19/us-lifts-funding-ban-on-studies-that-enhance-dangerous-germs|title=U.S. Lifts Funding Ban on Studies That Enhance Dangerous Germs|last=Steenhuysen|first=Julie|date=2017-12-19|work=U.S. News & World Report|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n* Dominant negative mutations (also called [[Muller's morphs#Antimorph|antimorphic]] mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele.

This step requires a tremendous scientific effort. Once the consensus sequence is known, the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed, described, and classified.

In principle, this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms. The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes.\n\n*Nucleotide substitution (e.g., 76A>T) \u2014 The number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5' end; the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine.\n**If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in [[genomic DNA]], [[mitochondrial DNA]], and [[RNA]], a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.\n*Amino acid substitution (e.g., D111E) \u2014 The first letter is the one letter [[Amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|code]] of the wild-type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the [[N-terminus]], and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).\n*Amino acid deletion (e.g., \u0394F508) \u2014 The Greek letter \u0394 ([[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type.\n\n==Mutation rates==\n{{Further|Mutation rate}}\n[[Mutation rate]]s vary substantially across species, and the evolutionary forces that generally determine mutation are the subject of ongoing investigation.\n\nThe genomes of [[RNA virus]]es are based on [[RNA]] rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]), replication occurs quickly, and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. This error-prone process often results in mutations.\n\n==Disease causation==\nChanges in DNA caused by mutation in a coding region of DNA can cause errors in protein sequence that may result in partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of ''Drosophila'' suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, the mutation will most likely be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref name=\"Sawyer2007\" /> However, studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doniger SW, Kim HS, Swain D, Corcuera D, Williams M, Yang SP, Fay JC | title = A catalog of neutral and deleterious polymorphism in yeast | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000183 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18769710 | pmc = 2515631 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000183 | editor-first = Jonathan K. | last7 = Fay | editor-link = Jonathan K.

This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]. An example of one is [[albinism]], a mutation that occurs in the OCA1 or OCA2 gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision.\n\nDNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder. DNA damages are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease. Once DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired.\n\n=== Role in carcinogenesis ===\n{{See also|Carcinogenesis}}\nOn the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of cause of [[malignant transformation]], from normal cell to cancer cell.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M|date=June 1993|title=Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis|journal=Nature|volume=363|issue=6429|pages=558\u201361|bibcode=1993Natur.363..558I|doi=10.1038/363558a0|pmid=8505985}}</ref>\n\nCells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated.

The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.\n\n===Prion mutations===\n\n[[Prion]]s are proteins and do not contain genetic material.

These include:\n**[[Chromosomal translocation]]s: interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.\n**[[Chromosomal inversion]]s: reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.\n** Non-homologous [[chromosomal crossover]].\n** Interstitial deletions: an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human [[astrocytoma]], a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes [[Carcinogenesis|oncogenic]] transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).\n*[[Loss of heterozygosity]]: loss of one [[allele]], either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles.\n\n==== Small-scale mutations ====\n\nSmall-scale mutations affect a gene in one or a few nucleotides. (If only a single nucleotide is affected, they are called [[point mutation]]s.) Small-scale mutations include:\n\n* [[Insertion (genetics)|Insertions]] add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by [[transposable element]]s, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] ([[splice site mutation]]), or cause a shift in the [[reading frame]] ([[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]]), both of which can significantly alter the [[gene product]]. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.\n* [[Deletion (genetics)|Deletions]] remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. In general, they are irreversible: Though exactly the same sequence might, in theory, be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1\u20132 bases) in ''any'' location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all.\n* [[Point mutation|Substitution mutations]], often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freese E | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 622\u201333 | date = April 1959 | pmid = 16590424 | pmc = 222607 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.45.4.622 | authorlink = Ernst Freese | bibcode = 1959PNAS...45..622F | title = The Difference Between Spontaneous and Base-Analogue Induced Mutations of Phage T4 }}</ref> These changes are classified as transitions or transversions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freese |first=Ernst | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 1959 |title=The specific mutagenic effect of base analogues on Phage T4 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87\u2013105 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(59)80038-3}}</ref> Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A \u2194 G) or a [[pyrimidine]] for a pyrimidine, (C \u2194 T). A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mispairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T \u2194 A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of [[adenine]] (A) into a cytosine (C). Point mutations are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). As discussed [[#By_impact_on_protein_sequence|below]], point mutations that occur within the protein [[coding region]] of a gene may be classified as [[Synonymous substitution|synonymous]] or [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s, the latter of which in turn can be divided into [[Missense mutation|missense]] or [[nonsense mutations]].\n\n=== By impact on protein sequence ===\n\n*A [[frameshift mutation]] is a mutation caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from the original.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hogan|first=C.

(For example, the code CCU GAC UAC CUA codes for the amino acids proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, and leucine. If the U in CCU was deleted, the resulting sequence would be CCG ACU ACC UAx, which would instead code for proline, threonine, threonine, and part of another amino acid or perhaps a [[stop codon]] (where the x stands for the following nucleotide).) By contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an ''in-frame mutation''.\n*A point substitution mutation results in a change in a single nucleotide and can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous.\n**A [[synonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for the same amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Synonymous mutations occur due to the [[Degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] nature of the [[genetic code]]. If this mutation does not result in any phenotypic effects, then it is called [[Silent mutation|silent]], but not all synonymous substitutions are silent. (There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial as it is in the coding regions, but these are not considered synonymous substitutions.)\n**A [[nonsynonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for a different amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is modified. Nonsynonymous substitutions can be classified as nonsense or missense mutations:\n***A [[missense mutation]] changes a nucleotide to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]], [[sickle-cell disease]], and [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD1]]-mediated [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Boill\u00e9e S, Vande Velde C, Cleveland DW|date=October 2006|title=ALS: a disease of motor neurons and their nonneuronal neighbors|journal=Neuron|volume=52|issue=1|pages=39\u201359|citeseerx=10.1.1.325.7514|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.018|pmid=17015226}}</ref> On the other hand, if a missense mutation occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid, then sometimes little or no change is rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode [[arginine]], a chemically similar molecule to the intended [[lysine]]. In this latter case the mutation will have little or no effect on phenotype and therefore be [[neutral mutation|neutral]].\n***A [[nonsense mutation]] is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a ''nonsense codon'' in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. This sort of mutation has been linked to different mutations, such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. (See [[Stop codon]].)\n\n===By effect on function===\n\n* Loss-of-function mutations, also called inactivating mutations, result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function ([[null allele]]), it is often called an [[amorph (gene)|amorph]] or amorphic mutation in the [[Muller's morphs]] schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]. Exceptions are when the organism is [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called [[haploinsufficiency]]).\n* Gain-of-function mutations, also called activating mutations, change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function.

This step requires a tremendous scientific effort. Once the consensus sequence is known, the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed, described, and classified. The committee of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) has developed the standard human sequence variant nomenclature,<ref name=\"paper45\">{{cite journal | vauthors = den Dunnen JT, Antonarakis SE | title = Mutation nomenclature extensions and suggestions to describe complex mutations: a discussion | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 7\u201312 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10612815 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1004(200001)15:1<7::AID-HUMU4>3.0.CO;2-N | authorlink2 = Stylianos Antonarakis }}</ref> which should be used by researchers and [[Genetic testing|DNA diagnostic]] centers to generate unambiguous mutation descriptions. In principle, this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms. The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes.\n\n*Nucleotide substitution (e.g., 76A>T) \u2014 The number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5' end; the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine.\n**If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in [[genomic DNA]], [[mitochondrial DNA]], and [[RNA]], a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.\n*Amino acid substitution (e.g., D111E) \u2014 The first letter is the one letter [[Amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|code]] of the wild-type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the [[N-terminus]], and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).\n*Amino acid deletion (e.g., \u0394F508) \u2014 The Greek letter \u0394 ([[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type.\n\n==Mutation rates==\n{{Further|Mutation rate}}\n[[Mutation rate]]s vary substantially across species, and the evolutionary forces that generally determine mutation are the subject of ongoing investigation.\n\nThe genomes of [[RNA virus]]es are based on [[RNA]] rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]), replication occurs quickly, and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. This error-prone process often results in mutations.\n\n==Disease causation==\nChanges in DNA caused by mutation in a coding region of DNA can cause errors in protein sequence that may result in partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of ''Drosophila'' suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, the mutation will most likely be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref name=\"Sawyer2007\" /> However, studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doniger SW, Kim HS, Swain D, Corcuera D, Williams M, Yang SP, Fay JC | title = A catalog of neutral and deleterious polymorphism in yeast | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000183 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18769710 | pmc = 2515631 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000183 | editor-first = Jonathan K. | last7 = Fay | editor-link = Jonathan K.

This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]. An example of one is [[albinism]], a mutation that occurs in the OCA1 or OCA2 gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision.\n\nDNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder. DNA damages are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease. Once DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired.\n\n=== Role in carcinogenesis ===\n{{See also|Carcinogenesis}}\nOn the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of cause of [[malignant transformation]], from normal cell to cancer cell.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M|date=June 1993|title=Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis|journal=Nature|volume=363|issue=6429|pages=558\u201361|bibcode=1993Natur.363..558I|doi=10.1038/363558a0|pmid=8505985}}</ref>\n\nCells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation happens often in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate. Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|author3=Rong H.

The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.\n\n===Prion mutations===\n\n[[Prion]]s are proteins and do not contain genetic material. However, prion replication has been shown to be subject to mutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8435320.stm|title='Lifeless' prion proteins are 'capable of evolution'|date=January 1, 2010|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2015-10-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132138/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8435320.stm|archivedate=25 September 2015|department=Health|location=London|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The human gene [[PRNP]] codes for the major prion protein, PrP, and is subject to mutations that can give rise to disease-causing prions.\n\n==Beneficial mutations==\nAlthough mutations that cause changes in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism, on occasions the effect may be positive in a given environment. In this case, the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection.

It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic.

Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic.

Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

The station is currently owned by [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] and the [[broadcast license]] is held by Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc.  WRGV broadcasts an [[urban contemporary]] music format to the greater Pensacola, Florida, and [[Mobile, Alabama]], area.  Its studios are located inside the building of unrelated television station [[WKRG]] on Broadcast Drive in Mobile, and the transmitter is near [[Robertsdale, Alabama]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1976, 107.3 FM belonged to '''WAJB-FM''', which was a beautiful music station with studios at the Tiger Point Country Club in Gulf Breeze, until it was purchased by Colonial Broadcasting in 1979.  The format was changed to [[country music]] along with new call letters, '''WOWW-FM''' to become known as \"WOW 107\", moving its studios to Davis Highway in Pensacola.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, \"WOW 107\" would rise up to become a country music power house, overthrowing the heritage country station in the market, WXBM-FM, and winning several ''Billboard'' Magazine's Station of the Year (small market) awards.  It was also known for its full-time News department, winner of multiple AP news awards.\n\nAs the 1980s ended, so did WOW 107's run of being a ratings king, now owned by Sun Media Group.  The 1990s saw several re-imaging attempts, including \"The New WOW 107.3\" and \"107 Thunder Country\", until its demise as a country station in 1995 when it became \"New Rock One Zero Seven\", flipping to [[alternative rock]]. Riding the popularity wave of mid-1990s Alternative Music, WOWW debuted at #1 in Arbitron's Persons 18-34, where it remained until the purchase and format flip by Paxson. New Rock 107 staff included Steve Williams, OM/AM Drive, Program Director Joel Sampson, PM Drive, Music Director LaLaine and Suzy Boe among others.\n\nIn 1996, the station was purchased by Southern Broadcasting, which owned New Rock 107's only competition, [[WTKX-FM|WTKX]], \"TK101\".  Two months later, both were purchased by [[Paxson Communications]].  After the Paxson purchase, TK101, being a heritage rock station since the mid-1970s, brought over WOWW's PD Joel Sampson, retained Midday personality Mark \"the Shark\" Dyba and added a majority of WOWW air staff and re-imaged itself as \"The Rock Station\", dropping the moniker \"The New Rock Alternative\", leaving WOWW without an airstaff or a format.\n\nAfter stunting for two days playing \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\" non-stop, WOWW changed formats to [[oldies]] from the 1950s and 1960s, and changed its call letters to '''WYCL''' (think \"Way Cool\").  As time went on, they phased out the 1950s music to include more 1970s songs.\n\n[[Image:My10732.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A billboard in downtown Pensacola advertising the change in format.]]\nThen in late 2004, the station's owner, now [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] (formerly Clear Channel Communications), switched the music format to \"My 107.3\" and played 1970s and 1980s music.  However, the \"My 70s, My 80s\" positioner was discontinued and the station used \"My Variety\" as its main positioner, in order to include a slightly wider variety of music.  The playlist remained mostly 1970s and early 1980s, with a fair amount of 1960s and other 1980s songs, making it a basic [[classic hits]] format.\n\nFor three years after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the station played breaking news bulletins every hour on top of the hour (first provided by [[ABC News]], then by Clear Channel Worldwide News), as well as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" at the start and close of each workday.\n\n[[File:WRGV 107.3KissFM logo.png|thumb|Kiss FM logo, 2015-2017]]\nIn February 2010, the station ceased the \"My 107.3\" format and started airing the format of their [[sister station]], \"Lite Mix 99.9\". On February 26, 2010, at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. WYCL launched a new [[rhythmic adult contemporary]] format branded as \"107.3 The Groove\". The first song on The Groove was \"[[Into the Groove]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. On March 5, 2010, WYCL changed their call letters to '''WRGV''' to go with \"The Groove\" branding. After a year as a Rhythmic AC, WRGV evolved to Rhythmic Top 40 in April 2011. On September 2, 2011 WRGV changed their format to [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]], branded as \"107.3 Hit Music Now\".

The station is currently owned by [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] and the [[broadcast license]] is held by Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc.  WRGV broadcasts an [[urban contemporary]] music format to the greater Pensacola, Florida, and [[Mobile, Alabama]], area.  Its studios are located inside the building of unrelated television station [[WKRG]] on Broadcast Drive in Mobile, and the transmitter is near [[Robertsdale, Alabama]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1976, 107.3 FM belonged to '''WAJB-FM''', which was a beautiful music station with studios at the Tiger Point Country Club in Gulf Breeze, until it was purchased by Colonial Broadcasting in 1979.  The format was changed to [[country music]] along with new call letters, '''WOWW-FM''' to become known as \"WOW 107\", moving its studios to Davis Highway in Pensacola.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, \"WOW 107\" would rise up to become a country music power house, overthrowing the heritage country station in the market, WXBM-FM, and winning several ''Billboard'' Magazine's Station of the Year (small market) awards.  It was also known for its full-time News department, winner of multiple AP news awards.\n\nAs the 1980s ended, so did WOW 107's run of being a ratings king, now owned by Sun Media Group.  The 1990s saw several re-imaging attempts, including \"The New WOW 107.3\" and \"107 Thunder Country\", until its demise as a country station in 1994 when it became \"New Rock One Zero Seven\", flipping to [[alternative rock]]. Riding the popularity wave of mid-1990s Alternative Music, WOWW debuted at #1 in Arbitron's Persons 18-34, where it remained until the purchase and format flip by Paxson. New Rock 107 staff included Steve Williams, OM/AM Drive, Program Director Joel Sampson, PM Drive, Music Director LaLaine and Suzy Boe among others.\n\nIn 1996, the station was purchased by Southern Broadcasting, which owned New Rock 107's only competition, [[WTKX-FM|WTKX]], \"TK101\".  Two months later, both were purchased by [[Paxson Communications]].  After the Paxson purchase, TK101, being a heritage rock station since the mid-1970s, brought over WOWW's air staff and re-imaged itself as \"The Rock Station\", dropping the moniker \"The New Rock Alternative\", leaving WOWW without an airstaff or a format.\n\nAfter stunting for two days playing \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\" non-stop, WOWW changed formats to [[oldies]] from the 1950s and 1960s, and changed its call letters to '''WYCL''' (think \"Way Cool\").

It covers 1.518 square kilometers (375.1 acres) and has a peak of 285 meters (935 ft) above sea level. It is renowned for its numerous [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images which have been carved out of the hill's rock faces or free-standing structures erect since the times of the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618) and its Xingguochan Temple. It is considered as one of the \"Three Greatest Attractions in Jinan\" together with [[Baotu Spring]] and [[Daming Lake]]. It is also one of the 4A-rated [[Tourist attractions in China]]. Thousand Buddha Mountain is opened up as a public park in 1959, rated as AAAA-rated Tourist Attractions of China in 2005, and rated as National Park of China in March 2017.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jnqianfoshan.com/index.html|title=Jinan Qianfo Mountain Scenic Official SIte|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Apr 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legend==\nAccording to local tradition, the legendary [[Emperor Shun]] was credited to open up land and cultivate under the mountain. Thus, the Thousand Buddha Mountain is also known as the Shungeng Hill (meaning the hill where Shun cultivated).<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAccording to a legend related in the ''Youyang Zazu'' (''Youyang Miscellanies'') by the [[Tang Dynasty]] writer [[Duan Chengshi]] (800-863), the Thousand Buddha Mountain was originally located by the sea and the sea god had locked it in place there by a large lock in order to prevent the god in charge of the mountains from moving it around. However, eventually the lock broke and the mountain was hurled through the air into its present position. An artwork shaped as a large lock and a piece of chain has been placed on the summit of the mountain as a reference to the legend.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Qianfoshan buddha statues1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Buddha statues in a cliff south of the Xingguochan Temple]]\nBuddhism became popular in the Jinan area during the reign of [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]], the founder of the [[Sui Dynasty]]. With Buddhism, monks came to area and chiseled Buddha statues out of the flanks of the hill, which was originally called ''Miji Hill'' or ''Li Hill''. A temple, called the ''Thousand Buddha Temple'' (Qianfosi), was founded at the foot of the hill. Eventually, the hill was renamed after the temple into \"Thousand Buddha Mountain\". One of the old names, ''Li Hill'' (Li Shan), survives in the name of ''Lishan Road'', the major avenue which runs through Jinan towards the Thousand Buddha Mountain in north-south direction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Main Attractions ==\n\n=== Thousand Buddha Cliff ===\nThe [[Thousand-Buddha Cliff]] is located on the northern flank of the hill behind the Xingguochan Temple (s. below). The foot of the cliff is pierced by five caves, which are named (from west to east): Longquan (meaning Dragon Spring) Cave, Jile (meaning Extremely Happy) Cave, Qianlou (probably a person's name) Cave, and Luzhu (probably a person's name) Cave.  The caves' height ranges from 3&nbsp;meters down to only 20&nbsp;centimeters. About 130 Buddha statues which were carved into Thousand-Buddha Cliff during the Sui period remain today. The Jile Cave houses 16 Buddha statues, the tallest of which is 3&nbsp;meters high.\n\n=== Xingguochan Temple ===\n[[Image:Qianfoshan buddha statues2.jpg|right|thumb|218x218px|Buddha statues in a cave south of the Xingguochan Temple]]\nAlong with the Buddha statues, temples and other buildings were erected on the hill. The most renowned of these structures is the ''Xingguochan Temple'' ({{zh|c=\u5174\u56fd\u7985\u5bfa|p=Xing Guo Chan Si}}, literally: \"Development of the Country Buddhist Temple\") which was originally built during the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizhong]] of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] as an expansion of the Sui-Dynasty Qianfo Temple. Further enlargements were undertaken during the [[Song Dynasty]], but the temple was destroyed by war afterwards. Rebuilding was undertaken in 1468, during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The Guanying Hall, the Foye Hall, and the Thousand-Hands Buddha statue were added during the [[Qing Dynasty]].\nThe temple is located about halfway up the hill and can be reached via 300 stone steps. A large inscription (total area about 15&nbsp;square meters) cut into the cliff face to the southwest of the identifies it as the \"Number One Temple\" (Di Yi Mi Hua). The temple's courtyards feature several stone tablets bearing inscriptions from renowned calligraphers. In one of the temple's courtyards stands a sculpture of the legendary [[Emperor Shun]], who is\u2014according to the local tradition\u2014credited with first ploughing the soil in Jinan as well as with inventing the writing brush. Because of its mythological association with Emperor Shun, the Thousand Buddha hill is also known as ''Shungeng Hill''. The main structure of the temple are: Grand Prayer Hall, [[Guanying]] Hall, [[Dharma]] Hall, [[Maitreya]] Hall, and the Buddhist Scripture building. Lishanyuan courtyard, to the east of the temple, is surrounded by sites of worship belonging to [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and Buddhism. The names of these buildings are: the Shun and the Luban Ancestral Temples, the Wenchang (\"Develop the Culture\") Cabinet, and the Yilan Kiosk. The temple has been the site of two annual temple fairs held on the 3rd day of the third month and 9th day of the 9th month of the Chinese [[Lunar Calendar]] since the times of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. It was burned down in wars and rebuild during the [[Ming Dynasty]].

It covers 1.518 square kilometers (375.1 acres) and has a peak of 285 meters (935 ft) above sea level. It is renowned for its numerous [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images which have been carved out of the hill's rock faces or free-standing structures erect since the times of the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618) and its Xingguochan Temple. It is considered as one of the \"Three Greatest Attractions in Jinan\" together with [[Baotu Spring]] and [[Daming Lake]]. It is also one of the 4A-rated [[Tourist attractions in China]]. Thousand Buddha Mountain is opened up as a public park in 1959, rated as AAAA-rated Tourist Attractions of China in 2005, and rated as National Park of China in March 2017.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jnqianfoshan.com/index.html|title=Jinan Qianfo Mountain Scenic Official SIte|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Apr 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legend==\nAccording to local tradition, the legendary [[Emperor Shun]] was credited to open up land and cultivate under the mountain. Thus, the Thousand Buddha Mountain is also known as the Shungeng Hill (meaning the hill where Shun cultivated). \n\nAccording to a legend related in the ''Youyang Zazu'' (''Youyang Miscellanies'') by the [[Tang Dynasty]] writer [[Duan Chengshi]] (800-863), the Thousand Buddha Mountain was originally located by the sea and the sea god had locked it in place there by a large lock in order to prevent the god in charge of the mountains from moving it around. However, eventually the lock broke and the mountain was hurled through the air into its present position. An artwork shaped as a large lock and a piece of chain has been placed on the summit of the mountain as a reference to the legend.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Qianfoshan buddha statues1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Buddha statues in a cliff south of the Xingguochan Temple]]\nBuddhism became popular in the Jinan area during the reign of\n[[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]], the founder of the [[Sui Dynasty]]. With Buddhism, monks came to area and chiseled Buddha statues out of the flanks of the hill, which was originally called ''Miji Hill'' or ''Li Hill''. A temple, called the ''Thousand Buddha Temple'' (Qianfosi) was founded at the foot of the hill. Eventually, the hill was renamed after the temple into \"Thousand Buddha Mountain\". One of the old names, ''Li Hill'' (Li Shan), survives in the name of ''Lishan Road'', the major avenue which runs through Jinan towards the Thousand Buddha Mountain in north-south direction.\n\n== Main Attractions ==\n\n=== Thousand Buddha Cliff ===\nThe [[Thousand-Buddha Cliff]] is located on the northern flank of the hill behind the Xingguochan Temple (s. below). The foot of the cliff is pierced by five caves, which are named (from west to east): Longquan (Dragon Spring) Cave, Jile (Extremely Happy) Cave, Qianlou (probably a person's name) Cave, and Luzhu (probably a person's name) Cave.  The caves' height ranges from 3&nbsp;meters down to only 20&nbsp;centimeters. About 130 Buddha statues which were carved into Thousand-Buddha Cliff during the Sui period remain today. The Jile Cave houses 16 Buddha statues, the tallest of which is 3&nbsp;m high.\n\n=== Xingguochan Temple ===\n[[Image:Qianfoshan buddha statues2.jpg|right|thumb|218x218px|Buddha statues in a cave south of the Xingguochan Temple]]\nAlong with the Buddha statues, temples and other buildings were erected on the hill. The most renowned of these structures is the ''Xingguochan Temple'' ({{zh|c=\u5174\u56fd\u7985\u5bfa|p=Xing Guo Chan Si}}, literally: \"Development of the Country Buddhist Temple\") which was originally built during the reign of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizhong]] of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] as an expansion of the Sui-Dynasty Qianfo Temple. Further enlargements were undertaken during the [[Song Dynasty]], but the temple was destroyed by war afterwards. Rebuilding was undertaken in 1468, during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The Guanying Hall, the Foye Hall, and the Thousand-Hands Buddha statue were added during the [[Qing Dynasty]].\nThe temple is located about halfway up the hill and can be reached via 300 stone steps. A large inscription (total area about 15&nbsp;square meters) cut into the cliff face to the southwest of the identifies it as the \"Number One Temple\" (Di Yi Mi Hua). The temple's courtyards feature several stone tablets bearing inscriptions from renowned calligraphers. In one of the temple's courtyards stands a sculpture of the legendary [[Emperor Shun]], who is\u2014according to the local tradition\u2014credited with first ploughing the soil in Jinan as well as with inventing the writing brush. Because of its mythological association with Emperor Shun, the Thousand Buddha hill is also known as ''Shungeng Hill''. The main structure of the temple are: Grand Prayer Hall, [[Guanying]] Hall, [[Dharma]] Hall, [[Maitreya]] Hall, and the Buddhist Scripture building. Lishanyuan courtyard, to the east of the temple, is surrounded by sites of worship belonging to [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and Buddhism. The names of these buildings are: the Shun and the Luban Ancestral Temples, the Wenchang (\"Develop the Culture\") Cabinet, and the Yilan Kiosk. The temple has been the site of two annual temple fairs held on the 3rd day of the third month and 9th day of the 9th month of the Chinese [[Lunar Calendar]] since the times of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. It was burned down in wars and rebuild during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Other notable buildings on the hill are: the ''Pagoda Tree Pavilion'' (Tang Dynasty), ''Cloud Passing Zen Temple'', and the ''Tanghuai Kiosk''.[[Image:qianfoshan xingguochantemple.jpg|left|thumb|236x236px|East gate of Xingguochan Temple]]Many of the statues on the Thousand Buddha Mountain were damaged or lost during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but restoration started in 1979 already.
