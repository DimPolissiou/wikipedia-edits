It was beaten to the air by only 13 days by the [[de Havilland Comet]], thereby becoming the second jet airliner in the world. The name \"Jetliner\" was chosen as a shortening of the term \"jet airliner\", a term which is still in popular usage. The aircraft was considered suitable for busy routes along the US eastern seaboard and garnered intense interest, notably from [[Howard Hughes]] who even offered to start production under license. However continued delays in Avro Canada's all-weather [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] project, the [[CF-100 Canuck]], led to an order to stop working on the project in 1951, with the prototype Jetliner later cut up for scrap.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Genesis===\n\nIn 1945 [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA) started exploring a number of aircraft developments under the direction of Jim Bain. [[Avro]] of England, who had recently taken over the [[Victory Aircraft]] \"shadow factory\" in Toronto, and started exploring production possibilities with TCA for a twin-engine [[turboprop]] aircraft like the [[Vickers Viscount]].<ref>Chandler 2009, p. 2.</ref> In the fall of 1945, Bain travelled to England to visit various aircraft companies, and during his exploration of [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]'s engine department, saw the early work on what was then known as the AJ65, a new [[Axial compressor|axial-flow]] [[turbojet]] engine. The new engine, later known as the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]], enthralled Bain and on his return to Canada he changed plans for Avro's development to use the new engine instead of turboprops.<ref>McArthur 2003, Roger's speech.</ref>\n\nOver the next few months, the teams at TCA and Avro refined the requirements, which were signed off on 9 April 1946. They called for a 36-seat aircraft with a cruising speed of 425 miles per hour (684&nbsp;km/h), a range of 1,200 miles (1,900&nbsp;km), an average distance between stops of 250 miles (400&nbsp;km) and a longest single flight of 500 mi (800&nbsp;km). The difference between the range and maximum airport distances was to allow for the required 45 minutes [[Holding (aeronautics)|stacking]] and diversion to a 120-mile (190-km)-distant alternate airport in a 20&nbsp;mph (30&nbsp;km/h) headwind. The aircraft also needed to be able to operate from existing 4,000&nbsp;ft (1,200&nbsp;m) runways. Load was 12,700&nbsp;lbs and 50 passengers.<ref>Campagna 2003, p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe agreement also specified a number of contractual terms that, in retrospect, appear especially odd. In spite of TCA's experience with contracting for the [[Ministry of Transport]], and Bain's personal arguments that [[cost-plus contract]]s be used as a ward against [[cost overrun|budget overruns]], TCA's contract with Avro demanded fixed prices for the entire development, as well as a fixed price for the aircraft of C$350,000. Additionally, Avro was not allowed to sell the aircraft to any other airline for three years. After that period, if a buyer paid less than C$350,000 for the aircraft, Avro would have to pay the difference to TCA. Furthermore, during the testing period of one year after the first aircraft was introduced, Avro would have to pay all costs, even if paying passengers were carried. Jack Dyment, chief of TCA's entire engineering department, suggested that Avro pay for the testing so that it would \"permit us to learn how to successfully operate a jet aircraft without having to pay for such experience the hard way.\"<ref name= \"Campagna pp. 27\u201328\">Campagna 2003, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Design changes===\nIn 1947, [[Fred Smye]], president of Avro, advised [[Herbert James Symington]] of TCA that they could not meet the fixed price contract. Symington's response was to pull out of the project, perhaps due to having successfully taken delivery of their new [[Canadair North Star]]s.{{cn|date=October 2016}} [[C. D. Howe]] stepped in and offered $1.5 million to continue the project, at a slower pace.<ref>Campagna 2003, p. 28.</ref> At about the same time, Rolls-Royce told Avro that the civil certification of the Avon could not be guaranteed in time for the Jetliner's rollout. This, in turn, would lead to higher operational and maintenance costs. Nevertheless, Avro continued with its plan to build the jet, selecting four [[Rolls-Royce Derwent 5|Rolls-Royce Derwents]] to replace the two Avons.<ref name= \"Campagna pp. 27\u201328\"/>\n\n[[File:Rolls Royce Derwent Jet Engine.jpg|thumb|Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, used in the Avro Jetliner]]\n\nChief Designer [[James C. Floyd]] was upset by these developments, but in the end found a number of advantages to the four-engine layout. The main advantage was that in an engine-out situation, the aircraft would lose only a quarter of its thrust, rather than half, which made power tolerances easier to meet. In particular, the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw in the case of an engine failure, but with four engines it was found yaw was so small it could be corrected easily with just the manual trim controls.<ref name= \"Campagna p. 29\"/>\n\nAlthough bearing some resemblance to the jet-powered [[Avro Tudor]] 8 and 9 (the former flying on jet power in 1948 and the latter becoming the [[Experimental aircraft|experimental]] [[Avro Ashton]] first flying in 1950), Floyd's design was conceived from the outset as a commercial jet airliner.<ref>Winchester 2005, p. 68.</ref> The updated design was presented in October 1948, and in February 1948 TCA responded with changes of their own. Now they wanted the aircraft to cruise at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}}, and they increased the fuel requirements to allow for wider diversions. In April, Gordon McGregor took over the presidency of TCA, and told Smye that he did not want it to be the first airline with a jet. Nevertheless, the project pressed on, and was the topic of a major article in ''Aviation Week'' that November.<ref name= \"Campagna p. 29\">Campagna 2003, p. 29.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was scheduled to begin deliveries in May 1952, and enter service in October,<ref name= \"Floyd P. 143\">Floyd 1986, p. 143.</ref> which would have given it a full six years headstart on the [[Boeing 707|707]], which did not enter service until October 1958,<ref name= \"Floyd P. 143\"/> and more than 11 years on its top short-field competitor, the [[Boeing 727]]. Its short-field performance exceeded the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelles]] (with a comparable number of passengers).<ref name= \"Floyd P. 143\"/>\n\nProposals exist for 30-, 40-, and 50-seat models, as well as 52- and 64-seat [[Paratrooper|paratroop]] versions, high-altitude medical lab, [[photo reconnaissance]], cargo, and crew trainer types.<ref>Floyd 1986, pp. 268, Appendix 2.</ref> Given the difference in seat pitch at the time (compared to today), maximum capacity could readily have reached 100 even without a simple fuselage stretch.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Avro Jetliner.jpg|thumb|Avro Canada Jetliner in flight, 11 March 1950]]\n\nTwo years later, the first prototype, CF-EJD (-X), began taxiing tests, and first flew on 10 August 1949, only 25 months after the design had started, and only 13 days after the first flight of the DH Comet. A delay caused by runway construction at the company's home, Malton airport, combined with repairs necessitated by external nacelle skin \"buckling\", prevented the Jetliner from being the first jet-powered airliner to fly.<ref>Floyd 1986, pp. 56, 63.</ref> On its second flight, on 16 August, the landing gear failed to extend, and the Jetliner had to make a [[belly landing]]. However, the damage was minor, and the aircraft was in the air again in three weeks.\n\nDuring its first inspection in November the servo rudder was removed as unnecessary but the servo elevators were retained for dealing with extreme centre-of-gravity positions.<ref>''Flight'' p14, p22</ref>\n\nOn April 18th 1950, the Jetliner carried the world's first jet airmail from [[Toronto]] to [[New York City]] in 58 minutes\u2013 half the previous record (c. 340 miles, 352&nbsp;mph). This was the first flight of a jet passenger plane in the United States while the Jetliner was the FIRST jet transport in the Western Hemisphere. The flight was a Canadian first and it was highly publicized and the crew was welcomed with a ticker tape parade through the streets of Manhattan! So new was the concept of jet power that the Jetliner was made to park far from the terminal, and pans were placed under the engines in case they dripped any \"self-igniting fuel.\" On its return the next day, the Jetliner returned to Canada via Montreal.\n\nAt the time, in the mid-1950s, the [[Cold War]] was starting and the Canadian authorities were in the midst of expanding the military. Avro was involved in designing the first dedicated jet-powered, all-weather fighter for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]], the [[Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck]]. The project was somewhat delayed, although the company's continuing work on the Jetliner caused some controversy. After the prototype returned, it still had no immediate sales prospects, and [[C.D. Howe]] (the \"minister of everything\") therefore  ordered the program stopped in December 1951. The second prototype Jetliner, nearly completed in the main assembly hangar, was broken up at that time.\n\nNevertheless, only a few months later, the enigmatic [[Howard Hughes]] first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner prototype for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He tried to buy 30 Jetliners for use by [[TWA]], but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started looking at US companies to build it for him; [[Convair]] proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its [[Avro Canada Orenda|Orenda turbojet]] and CF-100 jet fighter programs. Furthermore, the U.S government would not agree to Convair investing effort and manufacturing space to a civil project in view of the ongoing Korean Crisis, which itself was beginning to lead into the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avroland.ca/al-c102.html|title=AvroLand - AVRO JETLINER C-102|website=www.avroland.ca}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe project was almost restarted in 1953, when CF-100 production was in full swing, but this never happened. In 1955, TCA ordered 51 [[Vickers Viscount]] [[turboprop]] aircraft from [[Vickers|Vickers-Armstrong]] in England. These were the first turbine-powered aircraft in regular service in North America. They continued in service until 1974.\n\n===Cancellation===\nThe Jetliner was later used as the aerial photo platform for the CF-100 project. On 10 December 1956, the Jetliner was ordered surplused, and although it was donated to the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], they had no room for it in storage and took only the nose section for cockpit layout design. The rest of the Jetliner was cut up on 13 December 1956. The only surviving parts are the nose and cockpit section in the [[Canada Aviation and Space Museum]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.<ref>{{cite web|title=AVRO CANADA C.102 JETLINER|url=http://ingeniumcanada.org/aviation/collection-research/artifact-avro-canada-jetliner.php|website=Ingenium|publisher=Ingenium|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n\n[[Canada Post]] issued a stamp to commemorate the development of the Jetliner. Jetliner Road in Mississauga, Ontario is named for the airliner at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].  \"Avro Jetliner Private\" street name also commemorates the aircraft at Ottawa McDonald Cartier International Airport.\n\n==Specifications Avro C102 Jetliner==\n[[File:Avro Canada C102 Jetliner model.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the C102]]\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Avro Aircraft since 1908<ref name=Jackson>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=A.J. |title=Avro Aircraft since 1908 |date=1965 |publisher=Putnam Aeronautical |page=444 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=\n|capacity=payload {{cvt|12700|lb|0}}<ref name=Flight22>''Flight'' p22</ref>\n|length ft=82\n|length in=5\n|length note=\n|span ft=98\n|span in=1\n|span note=\n|height ft=\n|height in=\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=1097\n|wing area note=\n|swept area sqft=<!-- swing-wings -->\n|swept area note=\n|volume ft3=<!-- lighter-than-air -->\n|volume note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil='''root:'''  [[NACA airfoil|NACA 23016.5]]; '''tip:''' [[NACA airfoil|NACA 23012]]<ref name=\"Selig\">{{cite web |last1=Lednicer |first1=David |title=The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage |url=https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/aircraft.html |website=m-selig.ae.illinois.edu |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref>\n|empty weight lb=27427\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight lb=55000\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|lift lb=<!-- lighter-than-air -->\n|lift note=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=4\n|eng1 name=[[Rolls-Royce Derwent V]]\n|eng1 type=[[centrifugal-flow turbojet]] engines\n|eng1 hp=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 shp=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 lbf=3600\n|eng1 note= (later fitted with 2x Derwent 8 {#2 & #4} and 2x Derwent 9 engines {#1 & #3})\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed mph=417\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|30000|ft}}\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed mph=376\n|cruise speed note=at {{cvt|30000|ft}}\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range miles=1680\n|range note=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling ft=40300\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ftmin=2220\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=51.86\n|wing loading note=<ref name=Flight22/>\n|thrust/weight=\n\n|more performance=\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Aviation|Canada}}\n{{aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=\n* [[Avro Ashton]]\n* [[Baade 152]]\n* [[de Havilland Comet]]\n|see also=\n* [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]] \u2013 Nene Viking\n|lists=\n* [[list of jet airliners]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Campagna, Palmiro.

So new was the concept of jet power that the Jetliner was made to park far from the terminal, and pans were placed under the engines in case they dripped any \"self-igniting fuel.\" On its return the next day, the Jetliner returned to Canada via Montreal.\n\nAt the time, in the mid-1950s, the [[Cold War]] was starting and the Canadian authorities were in the midst of expanding the military. Avro was involved in designing the first dedicated jet-powered, all-weather fighter for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]], the [[Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck]]. The project was somewhat delayed, although the company's continuing work on the Jetliner caused some controversy. After the prototype returned, it still had no immediate sales prospects, and [[C.D. Howe]] (the \"minister of everything\") therefore  ordered the program stopped in December 1951. The second prototype Jetliner, nearly completed in the main assembly hangar, was broken up at that time.\n\nNevertheless, only a few months later, the enigmatic [[Howard Hughes]] first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner prototype for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He tried to buy 30 Jetliners for use by [[TWA]], but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started looking at US companies to build it for him; [[Convair]] proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its [[Avro Canada Orenda|Orenda turbojet]] and CF-100 jet fighter programs. Furthermore, the U.S government would not agree to Convair investing effort and manufacturing space to a civil project in view of the ongoing Korean Crisis, which itself was beginning to lead into the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avroland.ca/al-c102.html|title=AvroLand - AVRO JETLINER C-102|website=www.avroland.ca}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe project was almost restarted in 1953, when CF-100 production was in full swing, but this never happened. In 1955, TCA ordered 51 [[Vickers Viscount]] [[turboprop]] aircraft from [[Vickers|Vickers-Armstrong]] in England. These were the first turbine-powered aircraft in regular service in North America. They continued in service until 1974.\n\n===Cancellation===\nThe Jetliner was later used as the aerial photo platform for the CF-100 project. On 10 December 1956, the Jetliner was ordered surplused, and although it was donated to the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], they had no room for it in storage and took only the nose section for cockpit layout design. The rest of the Jetliner was cut up on 13 December 1956. The only surviving parts are the nose and cockpit section in the [[Canada Aviation and Space Museum]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.<ref>{{cite web|title=AVRO CANADA C.102 JETLINER|url=http://ingeniumcanada.org/aviation/collection-research/artifact-avro-canada-jetliner.php|website=Ingenium|publisher=Ingenium|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n\n[[Canada Post]] issued a stamp to commemorate the development of the Jetliner.

The Hotty Toddy was printed along with all of the popular sports cheers used by the students at the time. However, the lyrics were slightly different than the version used today. The original cheer was printed:<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.al.com/sports/2013/09/what_is_a_hotty_toddy_and_why.html|title=What is a Hotty Toddy, and why do Ole Miss fans get so excited about it?

Perhaps the leading theory suggests that the cheer was created by the school`s cheerleaders or band.<ref>University of Mississippi, \"The Ole Miss\" (1924). The Ole Miss Annual (1897-2013). 28.\nhttps://egrove.olemiss.edu/yearbooks/28</ref> The cheer was printed several days before Ole Miss was set to face off against instate rival Mississippi State, who were said to refer to Ole Miss fans as \"Hoity-Toitys.<ref>The Ole Miss Experience (9th Ed) edited by Leslie Showalter.\nNautilus Publishing Company, 2019, {{ISBN|978-1-949455-08-3}}</ref>\"  Ole Miss had lost thirteen straight games going into the 1926 matchup in Starkville.

According to ''The Ole Miss Experience'', music professor Arleen Tye wrote a fight song for the school in 1931 entitled \u201cOle Miss.\u201d The song`s chorus included \u201cHi-ty, Ti-ty, Gosh a\u2019mighty, Who the heck are we?\u201d.<ref name=\"auto\">Banahan, Leslie.

The Nautilus Publishing Company, 2015.</ref> While the original fight song was discontinued, the school`s current fight song, ''Forward Rebels'', includes the Hotty Toddy cheer as well.

Upon its completion, the band received a standing ovation from more than 70,000 people on hand that day. It soon became a staple of the band for many years. During Ole Miss's winning streak of 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hYZchGNpfehQCPms8szK9zLkgZHQD9BT1ACG0|title=Associated Press: Ole Miss head wants song halted over South chant|publisher=}}</ref> audiences began chanting \"[[The South will rise again]]\" in place of \"His truth is marching on\" at the end of the song.  The chant remained a staple for the next several years. In 2009, with Ole Miss in the national spotlight for football success, political pressure mounted to do away with the chant. The Student Body Government proposed to call for the chant to be changed to \"To Hell with LSU\".

His father also taught Beevers how to work out [[permutation]]s and [[probability|probabilities]] on a [[Sinclair ZX81]] computer. Beevers left school at age 16, and became a part of a card-counting team with his father and two others at age 18. They often played at the Sergeant Yorkes Casino in [[Luton]], where they found a [[croupier]] who often paid out 3\u20131 on blackjacks, and sometimes also paid out when a player's hand was bust. The team eventually stopped playing as their success led to Beevers being banned from 4 London [[casino]]s, and his father being banned from 19. Between them they were banned from 21 out of 23 London casinos. They also went to gamble on [[horse racing]] events about three times a week.<ref name=\"swimming\">{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = Des | title = Swimming with the Devilfish | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4050-8952-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"startsomewhere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehendonmob.com/joe_beevers/youve_got_to_start_somewhere.html|title=You've Got to Start Somewhere|publisher=The Hendon Mob|author=Beevers, Joe|accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref><ref name=\"timesonline\">{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9070-1277882,00.html|title=Risky Business|publisher=Business Times Online|author=Anonymous|accessdate=2006-08-03 | location=London | date=2004-10-03}}</ref><ref name=\"mayint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pokerchannel.co.uk/index.php?pg=30&id=9&title=Up+Close+and+Personal+with+The+Elegance%21&ind=17|title=Up Close and Personal with The Elegance|publisher=[[The Poker Channel]]|author=May, Jesse|authorlink=Jesse May|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref>\n\nBeevers worked first for [[NatWest]] (as his father had done before him) then for [[Citibank]] in [[Hammersmith]].

Her performing career continued with frequent appearances with the John Biggs Consort, led by her husband composer John Biggs which featured medieval and Renaissance music.<ref name=\"LATim -1996-05-12\"/> Note: some sources incorrectly refer to Laurindo Almeida as Terri's husband.  Almeida and Terri were not married.\n\nHer most widely known recording, Bachianas Brasileiras, was featured in the film Fifty Shades of Grey (2014) as well as at the Winter Olympics.\n\n==Terri's musical perspective==\nA 1960 [[Toronto Telegram]] profile of Terri included this observation from the singer/composer/arranger:\n\n''\"I don't like words or phrases like 'longhair' or 'the classics' or 'pops' or 'easy listening'\u2026they are 'dividing lines'; words which reinforce and perpetuate outmoded narrow prejudices instead of sweeping them aside.  To me, the whole world of music is so wide and deep and exciting that there just never will be enough hours in a day or days in a week to let me hear and sing and soak up all the marvelous things available\u2026We all strongly believe there are many different kinds of good music and we are opposed to musical snobbery wherever it exists.\"''<ref name=GilmourC-TT/>\n\nThe author Clyde Gilmour observed ''\"the 'we' included her friend and colleague Laurindo Almeida, the renowned guitarist\u2026conductor [[Roger Wagner]]\u2026a flute virtuoso named Martin Ruderman, and [[Robert E.

Her most popular recording, Duets With the Spanish Guitar, has been continuously reissued since its first print, and is a consistent seller (on CD) on Amazon.com and other online outlets.\n\nTerri was married to singer-composer John Biggs' (born 1932) and their Terri's daughters, Jennifer Biggs Walton and Adrienne Biggs, are both musicians.  Walton is a violinist and owns Instrumental Casting, an agency which casts musicians in film, television, video and commercial work. Adrienne plays the violin and performs with [[Danny Click]] and the Hell Yeahs, a California Bay Area band whose recent recordings have hit the Americana country music charts.\n\nA UK-based fan created a tribute site, www.salliterri.org, which has an extensive discography, photos, and notes from fans as well as former friends and students.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Discography==\n'''Solo Discography (LP) :'''\n* ''I Know My Love''  (1961)\n* ''Songs of the American Land''  (1960)\n* ''At the Gate of Heaven''  (1960)\n* ''Songs of Enchantment''  (1959)\n* ''For My True Love''  (1959)\n\n'''Books and scores by Salli Terri :'''\n* ''Rounds For Everyone From Everywhere'' (1961)\n* ''Shaker Worship Service'' (1971)\n* ''Around The Year In Rounds'' (1974)\n* ''A Moravian Lovefeast'' (1978)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.salliterri.org/ www.salliterri.org]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Terri, Salli}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:Canadian female singers]]\n[[Category:Canadian mezzo-sopranos]]\n[[Category:Canadian opera singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from London, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Operatic mezzo-sopranos]]\n[[Category:Thornton School of Music alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty]]\n[[Category:Wayne State University alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Canadian singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century opera singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century women opera singers]]\n", "name_user": "Mickeyvt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegacy:Grammatical", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salli_Terri"}
