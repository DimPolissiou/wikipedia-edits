{"title_page": "Debuccalization", "text_new": "{{Short description|Sound change towards glottal articulation}}{{Refimprove|date=April 2013}}\n{{Sound change}}\n{{IPA notice}}\n\n'''Debuccalization''' is a [[sound change]] or [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] in which an oral [[consonant]] loses its original [[place of articulation]] and moves it to the [[glottis]] (usually {{IPAblink|h}}, {{IPAblink|\u0266}}, or {{IPAblink|\u0294}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|p=2}}</ref> The pronunciation of a consonant as {{IPA|[h]}} is sometimes called aspiration but in [[phonetics]], [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] is the burst of air accompanying a [[stop consonant|stop]]. The word comes from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|bucca}}, meaning \"cheek\" or \"mouth\".\n\nDebuccalization is usually seen as a sub-type of [[lenition]], often defined as a consonant mutation involving the weakening of a consonant by progressive shifts in pronunciation. As with other forms of lenition, debuccalization may be [[synchrony and diachrony|synchronic or diachronic]] (i.e., it may involve alternations within a language [[allophone|depending on context]] or sound changes across time).\n\nDebuccalization processes occur in many different types of environments such as the following:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|pp=8\u201310}}</ref>\n* word-initially, as in [[Kannada language|Kannada]]\n* word-finally, as in [[Burmese language|Burmese]]\n* intervocalically, as in a number of [[English language|English]] varieties (e.g. ''litter'' {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u026a\u0294\u0259]}})\n\n==Glottal stop==\n===Arabic===\n{{IPA|/q/}} is debuccalized to {{IPA|/\u0294/}} in several Arabic varieties, such as northern [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]], western [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]], and urban [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] dialects, partially also in [[Jordanian Arabic]] (especially by female speakers).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bassiouney|first=Reem|title=Arabic Sociolinguistics|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-58901-573-9|location=Washington, DC|pages=158-161}}</ref> The [[Maltese language]], which was originally an Arabic dialect, also shows this feature.\n\n===British and American English===\nMost English-speakers in England and many speakers of [[American English]] debuccalize {{IPA|/t/}} to a glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}} in two environments: in word-final position before another consonant (American English IPA)\n*''get ready'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0294\u02c8\u0279\u025b\u027ei]}}\n*''not much'' {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u0251\u0294\u02c8m\u028ct\u0283]}}\n*''not good'' {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u0251\u0294\u02c8\u0261\u028ad\u031a]}}\n*''it says'' {{IPA|[\u026a\u0294\u02c8s\u025bz]}}\n\nand before a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] {{IPA|[n\u0329]}} following {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, or a vowel. Here the {{IPA|/t/}} may also be [[nasal release|nasally released]]. (American English IPA)\n*''Milton'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u026al\u0294n\u0329]}}\n*''Martin'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0251\u0279\u0294n\u0329]}}\n*''mountain'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u00e6\u028an\u0294n\u0329]}}\n*''cotton'' {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u02b0\u0251\u0294n\u0329]}}\n*''Latin'' {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u00e6\u0294n\u0329]}}\n\n===Cockney English===\nIn [[Cockney#Typical features|Cockney English]], {{IPA|/t/}} is often realized as a glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}} between vowels, liquids and nasals (notably in the word ''bottle''), a process called [[t-glottalization]].\n\n===German===\nIn [[German language|German]], voiceless stops are commonly debuccalized before syllabic nasals in the following clusters: {{IPA|/mpm\u0329, ltn\u0329, ntn\u0329, \u014bk\u014b\u030d/}}, which thus become {{IPA|[m\u0294m\u0329, l\u0294n\u0329, n\u0294n\u0329, \u014b\u0294\u014b\u030d]}}. For example, {{lang|de|Lumpen}} (\u201crags, tatters\u201d) is pronounced {{IPA|[l\u028am\u0294m\u0329]}}. In some dialects, debuccalization may also occur before syllabic {{IPA|[l\u0329]}}, though this is less common.\n\nVoiced stops are not usually debuccalized. However, many [[Upper German]] and [[East Central German]] dialects merge voiced and unvoiced stops at least word-internally  and these merged consonants will be debuccalized. Thus in [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]], {{lang|bar|Anten}} (\u201cducks\u201d) and {{lang|bar|Anden}} (\u201cAndes\u201d) are both pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0251n\u0294n\u0329]}}. Speakers are often unaware of this.\n\n==Glottal fricative==\n===Slavey===\nAll coda consonants in [[Slavey language|Slavey]] must be glottal. When a non-glottal consonant would otherwise be positioned in a syllable coda, it debuccalizes to {{IPA|[h]}}:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Smith|2008|p=527}}</ref>\n*{{IPA|/ts\u2019ad/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[ts\u2019ah]}} ('hat')\n*{{IPA|/xaz/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[xah]}} ('scar')\n*{{IPA|/tl\u2019u\u026e/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[tl\u2019uh]}} ('rope')\n\n===Scots/Scottish English===\nIn some varieties of [[Scots language|Scots]] (and [[Scottish English]]), particularly on the West coast, a non word-final {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} ''th'' shifted to {{IPA|[h]}}, a process called [[th-debuccalization]]. For example, {{IPA|/\u03b8\u026an/}} is realised as {{IPA|[h\u026an]}}.\n\n===Proto-Greek===\nIn [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], {{IPA|/s/}} shifted to {{IPA|[h]}} initially and between [[sonorant]]s ([[vowel]]s, [[liquid consonant|liquids]] and [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s).\n* [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*sept\u1e3f\u0325}} \u2192 [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|hept\u00e1}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f11\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac}}) \"seven\" (vs. [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|septem}})\n\nIntervocalic {{IPA|/h/}} was lost by the time of [[Ancient Greek]], and vowels in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] were [[synaeresis|contracted]] in the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect.\n* post-PIE ''*\u01f5\u00e9nesos'' \u2192 Proto-Greek {{lang|grk-x-proto|*g\u00e9nehos}} \u2192 [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{transl|grc|g\u00e9neos}} ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2}}) : [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{transl|grc|g\u00e9nous}} ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2}}) \"of a race\"\n\nBefore a liquid or nasal, an {{IPA|/h/}} was assimilated to the preceding vowel in Attic-Ionic and [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and to the following nasal in [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]. The process is also described as loss of {{IPA|/h/}} and subsequent lengthening of a vowel or consonant to keep the syllable the same [[syllable weight|length]] ([[compensatory lengthening]]).\n* PIE {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h\u2081\u00e9smi}} \u2192 Proto-Greek {{lang|grk-x-proto|*ehmi}} \u2192 Attic-Ionic {{transl|grc|\u0113m\u00ed}} ({{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af}}) : Aeolic {{transl|grc|\u00e9mmi}} ({{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03bc\u03bc\u03b9}}) \"I am\"\n\n===Sanskrit===\nIn [[Sanskrit]], {{IPA|/s/}} becomes {{IPA|[h]}} (written {{transl|sa|\u1e25}} in transliteration) when [[pausa|utterance-final]], e.g., {{transl|sa|k\u0101\u0301mas}} \"erotic love\" becomes {{transl|sa|k\u0101\u0301ma\u1e25}}.\n\n===West Iberian===\n====Spanish====\n{{main|Spanish dialects and varieties#Debuccalization of coda /s/|l1=Spanish dialects and varieties: Debuccalization of coda /s/}}\nA number of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Spanish dialects and varieties|dialects]] debuccalize {{IPA|/s/}} at the [[syllable coda|end]] of a [[syllable]] to {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPAblink|\u0266}}.\n\n====Galician====\nIn many varieties of [[Galician language|Galician]] as well as in [[Castrapo|Galician-influenced Spanish]], the phoneme {{IPA|/g/}} may debuccalize ({{lang|gl|[[gheada]]}}) to {{IPAblink|h}} in most or all instances, though {{IPAblink|x}} and {{IPAblink|\u0127}} are also possible realizations. There is also an inverse [[hypercorrection]] process of older or less educated Galician speakers replacing the phoneme {{IPAslink|x}} of the Spanish language by {{IPA|[g]}}, what is called {{lang|gl|gueada}}.\n\n====Portuguese====\n[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is much less affected by debuccalization, but it is especially notorious in its [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian variety]].\n\nAll over Brazil, the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0281/}} (historically an alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}} that moved to an uvular position) has a rather long inventory of allophones: {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|r}} {{IPAplink|\u0282|\u027b\u031d\u030a}} {{IPAplink|\u00e7}} {{IPAplink|x}} {{IPAplink|\u0263}} {{IPAplink|\u03c7}} {{IPAplink|\u0281}} {{IPAplink|\u0280}} {{IPAplink|\u0127}} {{IPAplink|h}} {{IPAplink|\u0266}}]}}. Only {{IPAblink|\u0263}} is uncommon. Few dialects, such as {{lang|pt|[[South Region, Brazil|sulista]]}} and {{lang|pt|[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|fluminense]]}}, give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants.\n\nIn such dialects, especially among people speaking an educated variety of Portuguese, it is usual for the rhotic coda in the [[Syllable#Rime|syllable rhyme]] to be an alveolar tap, as in European Portuguese and many registers of Spanish, or to be realized as {{IPAblink|\u03c7}} or {{IPAblink|x}}. In the rest of the country, it is generally realized as {{IPAblink|h}}, even among speakers not normally using this allophone or deleting it entirely, as is common in the vernacular.\n\nHowever, in some {{lang|pt|[[Minas Gerais|mineiro]]}}- and {{lang|pt|mineiro}}-influenced {{lang|pt|fluminense}} rural registers, {{IPA|[h]}} is used but as an allophone of {{IPAslink|l}} (rhotic consonants are most often deleted), a {{lang|pt|mar-mal}} merger, instead of the much more common and less stigmatized [[L-vocalization#Portuguese|{{lang|pt|mau-mal|nocat=yes}} merger]] characteristic of all Brazilian urban centers except for those bordering [[Mercosur]] countries, where coda {{IPAblink|\u026b}} was preserved, and the entire [[North Region, Brazil|North]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] regions. Its origin is the replacement of indigenous languages and {{lang|pt|[[l\u00edngua geral|l\u00ednguas gerais]]}} by Portuguese,{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} which created {{IPAblink|\u0279}}, {{IPAblink|\u027b}} and [[r-colored vowel]] as allophones of both {{IPA|/\u027e/}} (now mostly {{IPA|/\u0281/}}) and {{IPA|/l/}} (now mostly {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|w|u\u032f}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u028a|\u028a\u032f}}]}}) phonemes in the coda since Natives could not easily pronounce them ([[caipira dialect]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The later Portuguese influence from other regions made those allophones become rarer in some areas, but the {{lang|pt|mar-mal}} merger did not disappear in a few isolated villages and towns.\n\nFinally, many {{lang|pt|fluminense}} registers, especially those of the poor and of the youth, most northern and northeastern dialects, and, to a much minor degree, all other Brazilian dialects, debuccalize {{IPA|/s/}} (that is, {{IPA|[\u0255 ~ \u0291]}}) but less so than in Spanish. However, a {{lang|pt|mar-mas}} merger or even a {{lang|pt|mar-mais}} merger occurs: {{lang|pt|mas mesmo assim}} \"but even so\" or {{lang|pt|mas mesma, sim}} \"though, right, the same (f) one\" {{IPA|[m\u0250\u0266 \u02c8me\u0266m\u0259 \u02c8s\u0129]}}; {{lang|pt|mais}} light \"lighter, more slim\", or also \"less caloric/fatty\" {{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u0266 \u02c8lajt\u0255]}}; {{lang|pt|mas de mim, n\u00e3o}} \"but from me, no\" or {{lang|pt|mais de mim, n\u00e3o}} \"not more from me\" {{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u0266 d\u0291i \u02c8m\u0129 \u02c8n\u025c\u0303w]}}. A coda rhotic in the Brazilian dialects in the [[Centro-Sul]] area is hardly ever glottal, and the debuccalized {{IPA|/s/}} is unlikely to be confused with it.\n\n===Romanian===\nIn the Moldavian dialect of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{IPAslink|f}} is debuccalised to {{IPA|[h]}} and so, for example, {{lang|ro|s\u0103 fie}} becomes {{lang|ro|s\u0103 hie}}. The same occurred in [[Old Spanish]], Old [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Old Japanese]] and occurs today in [[Sylheti language |Sylheti]].\n\n===Goidelic Languages===\n{{main|Scottish Gaelic phonology#Lenition and spelling|Irish initial mutations|l1=Scottish Gaelic phonology: Lenition and spelling}}\nIn [[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]], ''s'' and ''t'' changed by [[lenition]] to {{IPA|[h]}}, spelled ''sh'' and ''th''.\n\n==Loanwords==\nDebuccalization can be a feature of loanword phonology.

The word comes from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|bucca}}, meaning \"cheek\" or \"mouth\".\n\nDebuccalization is usually seen as a sub-type of [[lenition]], often defined as a consonant mutation involving the weakening of a consonant by progressive shifts in pronunciation. As with other forms of lenition, debuccalization may be [[synchrony and diachrony|synchronic or diachronic]] (i.e., it may involve alternations within a language [[allophone|depending on context]] or sound changes across time).\n\nDebuccalization processes occur in many different types of environments such as the following:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|pp=8\u201310}}</ref>\n* word-initially, as in [[Kannada language|Kannada]]\n* word-finally, as in [[Burmese language|Burmese]]\n* intervocalically, as in a number of [[English language|English]] varieties (e.g. ''litter'' {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u026a\u0294\u0259]}})\n\n==Glottal stop==\n===Arabic===\n{{IPA|/q/}} is debuccalized to {{IPA|/\u0294/}} in several Arabic varieties, such as northern [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]], western [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]], and urban [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] dialects, partially also in [[Jordanian Arabic]] (especially by female speakers).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bassiouney|first=Reem|title=Arabic Sociolinguistics|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-58901-573-9|location=Washington, DC|pages=158-161}}</ref> The [[Maltese language]], which was originally an Arabic dialect, also shows this feature.\n\n===British and American English===\nMost English-speakers in England and many speakers of [[American English]] debuccalize {{IPA|/t/}} to a glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}} in two environments: in word-final position before another consonant (American English IPA)\n*''get ready'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0294\u02c8\u0279\u025b\u027ei]}}\n*''not much'' {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u0251\u0294\u02c8m\u028ct\u0283]}}\n*''not good'' {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u0251\u0294\u02c8\u0261\u028ad\u031a]}}\n*''it says'' {{IPA|[\u026a\u0294\u02c8s\u025bz]}}\n\nand before a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] {{IPA|[n\u0329]}} following {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, or a vowel.

For example, {{lang|de|Lumpen}} (\u201crags, tatters\u201d) is pronounced {{IPA|[l\u028am\u0294m\u0329]}}. In some dialects, debuccalization may also occur before syllabic {{IPA|[l\u0329]}}, though this is less common.\n\nVoiced stops are not usually debuccalized. However, many [[Upper German]] and [[East Central German]] dialects merge voiced and unvoiced stops at least word-internally  and these merged consonants will be debuccalized. Thus in [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]], {{lang|bar|Anten}} (\u201cducks\u201d) and {{lang|bar|Anden}} (\u201cAndes\u201d) are both pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0251n\u0294n\u0329]}}. Speakers are often unaware of this.\n\n==Glottal fricative==\n===Slavey===\nAll coda consonants in [[Slavey language|Slavey]] must be glottal. When a non-glottal consonant would otherwise be positioned in a syllable coda, it debuccalizes to {{IPA|[h]}}:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Smith|2008|p=527}}</ref>\n*{{IPA|/ts\u2019ad/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[ts\u2019ah]}} ('hat')\n*{{IPA|/xaz/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[xah]}} ('scar')\n*{{IPA|/tl\u2019u\u026e/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[tl\u2019uh]}} ('rope')\n\n===Scots/Scottish English===\nIn some varieties of [[Scots language|Scots]] (and [[Scottish English]]), particularly on the West coast, a non word-final {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} ''th'' shifted to {{IPA|[h]}}, a process called [[th-debuccalization]]. For example, {{IPA|/\u03b8\u026an/}} is realised as {{IPA|[h\u026an]}}.\n\n===Proto-Greek===\nIn [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], {{IPA|/s/}} shifted to {{IPA|[h]}} initially and between [[sonorant]]s ([[vowel]]s, [[liquid consonant|liquids]] and [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s).\n* [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*sept\u1e3f\u0325}} \u2192 [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|hept\u00e1}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f11\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac}}) \"seven\" (vs. [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|septem}})\n\nIntervocalic {{IPA|/h/}} was lost by the time of [[Ancient Greek]], and vowels in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] were [[synaeresis|contracted]] in the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect.\n* post-PIE ''*\u01f5\u00e9nesos'' \u2192 Proto-Greek {{lang|grk-x-proto|*g\u00e9nehos}} \u2192 [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{transl|grc|g\u00e9neos}} ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2}}) : [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{transl|grc|g\u00e9nous}} ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2}}) \"of a race\"\n\nBefore a liquid or nasal, an {{IPA|/h/}} was assimilated to the preceding vowel in Attic-Ionic and [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and to the following nasal in [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]].

There is also an inverse [[hypercorrection]] process of older or less educated Galician speakers replacing the phoneme {{IPAslink|x}} of the Spanish language by {{IPA|[g]}}, what is called {{lang|gl|gueada}}.\n\n====Portuguese====\n[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is much less affected by debuccalization, but it is especially notorious in its [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian variety]].\n\nAll over Brazil, the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0281/}} (historically an alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}} that moved to an uvular position) has a rather long inventory of allophones:{{IPA|[{{IPAplink|r}} {{IPAplink|\u0282|\u027b\u031d\u030a}} {{IPAplink|\u00e7}} {{IPAplink|x}} {{IPAplink|\u0263}} {{IPAplink|\u03c7}} {{IPAplink|\u0281}} {{IPAplink|\u0280}} {{IPAplink|\u0127}} {{IPAplink|h}} {{IPAplink|\u0266}}]}}. Only {{IPAblink|\u0263}} is uncommon. Few dialects, such as {{lang|pt|[[South Region, Brazil|sulista]]}} and {{lang|pt|[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|fluminense]]}}, give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants.\n\nIn such dialects, especially among people speaking an educated variety of Portuguese, it is usual for the rhotic coda in the [[Syllable#Rime|syllable rhyme]] to be an alveolar tap, as in European Portuguese and many registers of Spanish, or to be realized as {{IPAblink|\u03c7}} or {{IPAblink|x}}. In the rest of the country, it is generally realized as {{IPAblink|h}}, even among speakers not normally using this allophone or deleting it entirely, as is common in the vernacular.\n\nHowever, in some {{lang|pt|[[Minas Gerais|mineiro]]}}- and {{lang|pt|mineiro}}-influenced {{lang|pt|fluminense}} rural registers, {{IPA|[h]}} is used but as an allophone of {{IPAslink|l}} (rhotic consonants are most often deleted), a {{lang|pt|mar-mal}} merger, instead of the much more common and less stigmatized [[L-vocalization#Portuguese|{{lang|pt|mau-mal|nocat=yes}} merger]] characteristic of all Brazilian urban centers except for those bordering [[Mercosur]] countries, where coda {{IPAblink|\u026b}} was preserved, and the entire [[North Region, Brazil|North]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] regions. Its origin is the replacement of indigenous languages and {{lang|pt|[[l\u00edngua geral|l\u00ednguas gerais]]}} by Portuguese,{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} which created {{IPAblink|\u0279}}, {{IPAblink|\u027b}} and [[r-colored vowel]] as allophones of both {{IPA|/\u027e/}} (now mostly {{IPA|/\u0281/}}) and {{IPA|/l/}} (now mostly {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|w|u\u032f}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u028a|\u028a\u032f}}]}}) phonemes in the coda since Natives could not easily pronounce them ([[caipira dialect]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The later Portuguese influence from other regions made those allophones become rarer in some areas, but the {{lang|pt|mar-mal}} merger did not disappear in a few isolated villages and towns.\n\nFinally, many {{lang|pt|fluminense}} registers, especially those of the poor and of the youth, most northern and northeastern dialects, and, to a much minor degree, all other Brazilian dialects, debuccalize {{IPA|/s/}} (that is, {{IPA|[\u0255 ~ \u0291]}}) but less so than in Spanish. However, a {{lang|pt|mar-mas}} merger or even a {{lang|pt|mar-mais}} merger occurs: {{lang|pt|mas mesmo assim}} \"but even so\" or {{lang|pt|mas mesma, sim}} \"though, right, the same (f) one\" {{IPA|[m\u0250\u0266 \u02c8me\u0266m\u0259 \u02c8s\u0129]}}; {{lang|pt|mais}} light \"lighter, more slim\", or also \"less caloric/fatty\" {{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u0266 \u02c8lajt\u0255]}}; {{lang|pt|mas de mim, n\u00e3o}} \"but from me, no\" or {{lang|pt|mais de mim, n\u00e3o}} \"not more from me\" {{IPA|[\u02c8ma\u0266 d\u0291i \u02c8m\u0129 \u02c8n\u025c\u0303w]}}. A coda rhotic in the Brazilian dialects in the [[Centro-Sul]] area is hardly ever glottal, and the debuccalized {{IPA|/s/}} is unlikely to be confused with it.\n\n===Romanian===\nIn the Moldavian dialect of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{IPAslink|f}} is debuccalised to {{IPA|[h]}} and so, for example, {{lang|ro|s\u0103 fie}} becomes {{lang|ro|s\u0103 hie}}. The same occurred in [[Old Spanish]], Old [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Old Japanese]] and occurs today in [[Sylheti language |Sylheti]].\n\n===Goidelic Languages===\n{{main|Scottish Gaelic phonology#Lenition and spelling|Irish initial mutations|l1=Scottish Gaelic phonology: Lenition and spelling}}\nIn [[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]], ''s'' and ''t'' changed by [[lenition]] to {{IPA|[h]}}, spelled ''sh'' and ''th''.\n\n==Loanwords==\nDebuccalization can be a feature of loanword phonology. For example, while [[Korean language|Korean]] allows certain coda obstruents, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] does not. Those consonants realized in Korean as unreleased voiceless stops ({{IPA|[p\u02fa t\u02fa k\u02fa]}}) may be realized in Japanese as glottal stops:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whang|2012|p=2}}</ref>\n*{{IPA|[t\u0255uk\u02fa]}} \u2192 {{IPA|[t\u0255u\u0294]}} ('porridge')\n*{{IPA|[mok\u02fa]}} \u2192 {{IPA|[mo\u0294]}} ('neck')\n*{{IPA|[mat\u02fa]}} \u2192 {{IPA|[ma\u0294]}} ('flavor')\n*{{IPA|[tap\u02fa]}}\u2192 {{IPA|[ta\u0294]}} ('tower')\n\nSimilarly, debuccalization can be seen in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] loans into [[Selayar language|Selayar]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|p=28}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation\n|last=O'Brien\n|first=Jeremy Paul\n|year=2012\n|title=An experimental approach to debuccalization and supplementary gestures\n|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1cm694ff\n}}\n*{{citation\n|last=Smith\n|first=Jennifer L.\n|year=2008\n|chapter=X Markedness, faithfulness, positions, and contexts: Lenition and fortition in Optimality Theory\n|editor-last=de Carvalho\n|editor-first=Joaquim Brand\u00e3o\n|editor2-last=Scheer\n|editor2-first=Tobias\n|editor3-last=S\u00e9g\u00e9ral\n|editor3-first=Philippe\n|title=Lenition and Fortition\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztksXfGwLVgC&dq=\n}}\n*{{citation\n\t|last=Whang \n\t|first=James Dy \n\t|year=2012 \n\t|title=Perception of Illegal Contrasts: Japanese Adaptations of Korean Coda Obstruents \n\t|journal=Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society \n\t|url=https://files.nyu.edu/jdw412/public/james.whang/main_files/Whang.pdf \n\t|url-status=dead \n\t|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624212809/https://files.nyu.edu/jdw412/public/james.whang/main_files/Whang.pdf \n\t|archivedate=2013-06-24 \n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=wx-4wmfQbVMC&pg=PA123&dq=debuccalization+1990&hl=en&ei=DNE-TuDdCrSisQLbsc0y&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=debuccalization%201990&f=false \"Debuccalization\"] (Chapter 4 of Paul D.

The site extends from the river, on the west, to 1st Street Southeast, on the east. 6th Avenue Southeast forms the southern boundary of the site. To the north is an [[oxbow]] of the Mississippi River and, near 1st Street, the [[Burton-Rosenmeier House]]. Both houses are placed alongside an entry drive which forms an extension to Highland Avenue. The houses lie at the top of a bank that drops down to a level plain adjacent to the river. A garage and service building is located at the southern end of this area, which also contains a [[theater|playhouse]], [[gazebo]], and several vine-covered [[trellises]]. Sited on the bank adjoining the oxbow is a [[carriage house]], which contains living quarters on its upper floor. In front of the houses, a lawn extends out to 1st Street. A [[swimming pool|pool]], enclosed by a screened [[pavilion]], is placed near the center of this lawn. A [[tennis court]] is adjacent to the pool. All ground are well-tended, and are planted with a variety of [[shrubs]] and [[flowers]]. [[Trees]] were planted over the entire site to provide a [[forest]]-like setting. Both the Weyerhaeuser and Musser Houses were built in the [[Shingle Style]]. The houses were relatively compact in 1898; neither Weyerhaeuser nor Musser were yet married. Each has been enlarged, but the additions that were made have been in keeping with the materials, styling, and proportions of the original houses.\nSimilar materials are used on both houses. Exterior walls are clad primarily with [[shingles]]. The shingles are bellcast at the bottom of the second floor so that the floor line becomes clearly defined. Both are of [[wood-frame]] construction, and have two stories, large [[attics]], and full [[basements]], which are raised so that the main [[living room]]s on the first floor are several feet above ground level. The buildings differ in plan, and in several of their details. The Weyerhaeuser House lies to the south of the Musser House. The main body of the house is rectangular. A front [[porch]], originally open but now enclosed with glass panels, lies in front of a bay that projects out at the center of the main [[facade]]. Beside this entry is a smaller projecting bay that encloses the main stair. Both bays and the porch have [[gabled roof]]s, while the main body of the house is covered with a [[hipped roof]]. The house was extended to the north and south about 1910, with a [[sun room]] being constructed on the south side and a music room on the north.

The site extends from the river, on the west, to 1st Street Southeast, on the east. 6th Avenue Southeast forms the southern boundary of the site. To the north is an [[oxbow]] of the Mississippi River and, near 1st Street, the [[Burton-Rosenmeier House]]. Both houses are placed alongside an entry drive which forms an extension to Highland Avenue. The houses lie at the top of a bank that drops down to a level plain adjacent to the river. A garage and service building is located at the southern end of this area, which also contains a [[theater|playhouse]], [[gazebo]], and several vine-covered [[trellises]]. Sited on the bank adjoining the oxbow is a [[carriage house]], which contains living quarters on its upper floor. In front of the houses, a lawn extends out to 1st Street. A [[swimming pool|pool]], enclosed by a screened [[pavillion]], is placed near the center of this lawn. A [[tennis court]] is adjacent to the pool. All ground are well-tended, and are planted with a variety of [[shrubs]] and [[flowers]]. [[Trees]] were planted over the entire site to provide a [[forest]]-like setting. Both the Weyerhaeuser and Musser Houses were built in the [[Shingle Style]]. The houses were relatively compact in 1898; neither Weyerhaeuser nor Musser were yet married. Each has been enlarged, but the additions that were made have been in keeping with the materials, styling, and proportions of the original houses.\nSimilar materials are used on both houses. Exterior walls are clad primarily with [[shingles]]. The shingles are bellcast at the bottom of the second floor so that the floor line becomes clearly defined. Both are of [[wood-frame]] construction, and have two stories, large [[attics]], and full [[basements]], which are raised so that the main [[living room]]s on the first floor are several feet above ground level. The buildings differ in plan, and in several of their details. The Weyerhaeuser House lies to the south of the Musser House. The main body of the house is rectangular. A front [[porch]], originally open but now enclosed with glass panels, lies in front of a bay that projects out at the center of the main [[facade]]. Beside this entry is a smaller projecting bay that encloses the main stair. Both bays and the porch have [[gabled roof]]s, while the main body of the house is covered with a [[hipped roof]]. The house was extended to the north and south about 1910, with a [[sun room]] being constructed on the south side and a music room on the north. These extension replicate the shingle siding, [[stone]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]]s, and the roof and [[dormer]] configurations of the original house.\n}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://linden-hill.org/ Linden Hill Historic Estate's website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weyerhaeuser, Charles A., and Musser, Richard Drew, Houses}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota}}\n\t\t\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Morrison County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1898]]\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota]]\n", "name_user": "Mandarax", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Weyerhaeuser_and_Musser_Houses"}

The second invasion (1597\u20131598) is called the \"Second War of Jeong-yu\" (\u4e01\u9149). Collectively, the invasions are referred to as the '''Imjin War'''.\n\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the wars are referred to as the \"[[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] Korean Campaign\", after the reigning [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]], or the \"Renchen War to Defend the Nation\" (\u58ec\u8fb0\u885b\u570b\u6230\u722d), where ''renchen'' (\u58ec\u8fb0) is the Chinese reading of ''imjin''.\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the war is called ''[[Bunroku]] no eki'' (\u6587\u7984\u306e\u5f79). ''Bunroku'' referring to the [[Japanese era name]] of [[Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei]], spanning the period from 1592 to 1596. The second invasion (1597\u20131598) is called \"''[[Keich\u014d]] no eki''\" (\u6176\u9577\u306e\u5f79). During the [[Edo period]] (17\u201319th centuries), the war was also called \"''Kara iri''\" (\u5510\u5165\u308a \"entry into China\"), because Japan's ultimate purpose at the commencement of the invasion was the conquest of Ming China, although with the reality that the conflict was largely confined to the Korean Peninsula for the duration of the war, the armies of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] would alter their immediate objectives during the course of the campaign.\n\n==Overview==\nIn 1592, with an army of approximately 158,000 troops, Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched what would end up being the first of two invasions of Korea, with the intent of conquering Joseon Korea and eventually Ming-dynasty China. Initially, the Japanese forces saw overwhelming success on land, capturing both [[Hanseong]], the capital of Korea, and Pyongyang, and completing the occupation of large portions of the Korean Peninsula in three months. The Japanese forces, well trained, confident, and experienced after the numerous battles and conflicts of the [[Sengoku period]], typically held the field in most land engagements. This success on land, however, was constrained by the naval campaigns of the Korean navy which would continue to raid Japanese supply fleets in its coastal waters, hampering the Japanese advances as supply lines were disrupted along the Western Korean coast and Japanese naval reinforcements were repelled.<ref>{{cite book |last= Tucker|first= Spencer|date= December 23, 2009|title= A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|url= https://books.google.com/?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&dq=imjin+war+japanese+reinforcements+defeat|publisher= ABC-CLIO|page= 881|isbn= 9781851096725}} \"These [Korean] victories led the Japanese to send naval reinforcements...

Hideyoshi was also tempted by an external conflict to prevent internal rebellion within Japan, which would keep his newly-formed state united against a common enemy, and prevent the ''daimy\u014ds'' from acting on any ambitions against his rule. Fighting a war away from Japanese territory would also prevent territorial destruction, and maintain the infrastructure of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samurai-archives.com/hak.html|title=Hideyoshi and Korea|author=|date=|website=samurai-archives.com}}</ref> Such considerations would be consistent with the fact that Hideyoshi was not Sh\u014dgun and had no links with the imperial bloodline.\n\nTurnbull also suggests personal ambition and megalomania of Hideyoshi as reasons for the invasion. Hideyoshi had in a series of wars conquered Japan and now wanted to turn to bigger things, noting that he spoke not only of his desire to \"slash his way\" into Korea to conquer China, but also to conquer Taiwan (then not part of China), the Philippines, and India.<ref name=\"auto2\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Opsrey, 2008 p. 6.</ref> Furthermore, for thousands of years, China had been the intellectual, economic, military and political center of East Asia, and traditionally, the states of East Asia had acknowledged the Emperors of China as their overlords and paid tribute in exchange for being allowed to trade with China. Japan had usually resisted the demand to pay tribute to China, but Sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu had acknowledged the Emperor of China as his overlord in return for access to the huge Chinese market.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Japan's right to pay tribute and, with it, the right to trade with China was ended in the 1540s by the Ming court in response to raids by Sino-Japanese pirates known as the [[Wokou|''wak\u014d'']].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nBy seeking to conquer China, Hideyoshi was in effect claiming for Japan the role traditionally played by China in East Asia as the center of the East Asian international order, which would have rallied much support in Japan around a man of relatively humble origins who owed his position only to his military might.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Opsrey, 2008 p. 7.</ref> Finally, during the 1540s\u20131550s, the ''wak\u014d'' had staged a series of raids into China and Korea, some of which were so large as to be \"mini-invasions\" that caused much devastation. That seemed to suggest to Hideyoshi that both Korea and China were weak nations; if both had much difficulty in countering the ''wak\u014d'', how would they fare if they were faced with an army of battle-hardened samurai?<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHideyoshi planned for a possible war with Korea long before he had completed the unification of Japan.

However, as Tsushima Island enjoyed a special trading position as the single checkpoint to Korea for all Japanese ships and had permission from Korea to trade with as many as 50 of its own vessels,<ref name=\"turnbull28\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;28.</ref> the S\u014d family had a vested interest in preventing conflict with Korea, and delayed the talks for nearly two years.<ref name=\"turnbull34\" /> Even when Hideyoshi renewed his order, S\u014d Yoshitoshi reduced the visit to the Korean court to a campaign to better relations between the two countries. Near the end of the ambassadorial mission, Yoshitoshi presented King Seonjo a brace of peafowl and matchlock guns \u2013 the first advanced firearms to come to Korea.<ref name=\"Jones242\">Jones, Geo H., Vol. 23 No. 5, p.&nbsp;242</ref> [[Ryu Seong-ryong]], a high-ranking scholar official, suggested that the military put the [[arquebus]] (a [[matchlock]] firearm) into production and use, but the Korean court failed to appreciate its merits. This lack of interest and underestimation of the power of the arquebus greatly contributed to the failures of the Korean army early in the war.\n\nIn April 1590, the Korean ambassadors including Hwang Yun-gil and Kim Saung-il<ref name=\"Joongang112\">Jang, Pyun-soon. p.&nbsp;112</ref> left for [[Kyoto]], where they waited for two months while Hideyoshi was finishing his [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|campaign against the Hojo clan]].<ref name=\"turnbull36\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> Upon his return, they exchanged ceremonial gifts and delivered King Seonjo's letter to Hideyoshi.<ref name=\"turnbull36\" /> Hideyoshi mistakenly assumed that the Koreans had come to pay a tributary homage to Japan. For this reason the ambassadors were not given the formal treatment that was due to diplomatic representatives. In the end, the Korean ambassadors asked for Hideyoshi to write a reply to the Korean king, for which they waited 20 days at the port of Sakai.<ref name=\"turnbull36-37\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, pp.&nbsp;36\u201337.</ref> The letter, redrafted as requested by the ambassadors on the ground that it was too discourteous, invited Korea to submit to Japan and join in a war against China.<ref name=\"Jones242\" />\n\nUpon the ambassadors' return, the Joseon court held serious discussions concerning Japan's invitation;<ref name=\"Jones242-3\">Jones, Geo H., Vol. 23 No. 5, pp.&nbsp;242\u201343</ref> while [[Hwang Yun-gil]] reported conflicting estimates of Japanese military strength and intentions. They nonetheless pressed that a war was imminent. Kim Saung-il claimed that Hideyoshi's letter was nothing but a bluff. Moreover, the court, aware only that Japan was in turmoil with various clan armies fighting each other, substantially underrated the combined strength and abilities of many Japanese armies at the time. Some, including King Seonjo, argued that Ming should be informed about the dealings with Japan, as failure to do so could make Ming suspect Korea's allegiance, but the court finally concluded to wait further until the appropriate course of action became definite.<ref name=\"turnbull38\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;38.</ref>\n\nIn the end, Hideyoshi's diplomatic negotiations did not produce the desired result with Korea. The Joseon Court approached Japan as a country inferior to Korea, and saw itself as superior according to its favored position within the Chinese tributary system. It mistakenly evaluated Hideyoshi's threats of invasions to be no better than the common wokou Japanese pirate raids.<ref name=\"SWOPE760-761\">Swope. 2002. pp.&nbsp;760\u201371</ref> The Korean court handed to Shigenobu<ref name=\"Hulbert\" /> and Genso, Hideyoshi's third embassy, King Seonjo's letter rebuking Hideyoshi for challenging the Chinese tributary system. Hideyoshi replied with another letter, but since it was not presented by a diplomat in person as expected by custom, the court ignored it.<ref name=\"Jones243\">Jones, Geo H., Vol. 23 No. 5, p.&nbsp;243</ref> After this denial of his second request, Hideyoshi proceeded to launch his armies against Korea in 1592.\n\n===Forces===\n====Japanese====\n[[File:Daimyo Konishi Yukinaga Ukiyo-e.jpg|thumb|Daimyo [[Konishi Yukinaga]] commanded the Japanese First Division]]\n[[File:Kat\u014d Kiyomasa.jpg|thumb|Daimyo [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]] commanded the Japanese Second Division]]\n[[File:Kato Kiyomasa (1562-1611) Banner and Battle Standard.jpg|thumb|Kat\u014d Kiyomasa (1562\u20131611) banner and battle standard]]\n\nThe core of the Japanese forces were the [[samurai]], the military caste of Japan who dominated Japanese society.<ref name=\"auto3\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 18.</ref> Japanese society was divided into [[four occupations|four castes]]: samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, in that order. The samurai caste owned most of the land in Japan, had the sole right to carry swords and to execute on the spot any commoner who was insufficiently deferential, and were allowed to own horses and ride into battle.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The standard samurai weapon by 1592 was the [[yari]], a spear meant to stab, often with a cross-blade that allowed a samurai to pull his opponent from his horse.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> If samurai wished to cut his opponent rather than stab, the weapons were the [[\u014ddachi]], an extremely long sword with a huge handle, or the [[naginata]], a polearm with very sharp curved blade.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The most famous of all the samurai weapons was the [[katana]], a sword described by the British military historian Stephen Turnbull as \"...the finest edged weapon in the history of warfare\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Samurai never carried shields, with the ''katana'' being used to deflect blows.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> By 1592, the armor of the samurai was [[Lamellar armour|lamellae]] made from iron or leather scales tied together which had been modified to include solid plate to help protect the samurai from bullets.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Samurai engaged in psychological warfare by wearing an iron mask into battle with a mustache made of horsehair and a \"sinister grin\" attached to the outside.<ref name=\"auto4\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 19.</ref> The majority of the Japanese soldiers sent into Korea were ''[[ashigaru]]'' (infantrymen), who were usually conscripted peasants armed with spears, [[Tanegashima (gun)|tanegashima]] (Japanese arquebuses), or [[yumi]] (Japanese bows).<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 19</ref> Unlike the samurai with their expensive suits of armor, the ''ashigaru'' wore cheap suits of iron armour around their chests.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The ''ashigaru'' armed with arquebuses were trained to fight in the European style, with the men trained to fire their guns in formation to create a volley of fire, then to go down on their knees to reload, while the men behind them fired, and the cycle repeated over and over again.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nThe commander of the Japanese First Division and overall commander of the invasion force was [[Konishi Yukinaga]], a ''daimy\u014d'' (lord) of Uto from [[Higo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], chosen as commander of the invasion force more because of his diplomatic skills than military skills as Toyotomi Hideyoshi did not expect the Koreans to resist.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Konishi had converted to Catholicism in 1583, and was known to the Spanish and Portuguese as Dom Agostinho.<ref name=\"auto5\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 15.</ref> [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]] who led the Second Division into Korea was known in Japan as ''Toranosuke'' (\"the young tiger\") and to the Koreans as the \"devil general\" on the account of his ferocity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Kat\u014d was one of the \"Seven Spears of Shizugatake\", a group of seven samurai who distinguished himself in combat at the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, where samurai had fought one another ''mano a mano'', and where Kat\u014d demonstrated his skills with a cross-bladed spear with great effect by cutting so many men, whose severed and salted heads were thereafter tied to a stalk of green bamboo and carried by one of Kat\u014d's attendants into battle.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Kat\u014d was a devoted follower of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], a type of Buddhism closely associated with militarism and ultra-nationalism in Japan, and his relations with the [[Catholic Church in Japan|Catholic Konishi]] were extremely unfriendly, to the extent that the two men almost never met during the campaign in Korea.<ref name=\"auto6\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 16.</ref> Kat\u014d's battle standard was a white pennant which carried a message alleged to be have been written by Nichiren himself reading ''[[Namu My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d]]'' (\"Hail to the Lotus of the Divine Law\").<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The naval commander was Wakizaka Yashuaru, another of the \"Seven Spears of Shizugatake\", who had been named ''daimy\u014d'' of the island of Awaji in the Inland Sea in 1585, where he learned much about seafaring as the island is located close to whirlpools which are notoriously dangerous for sailors.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Toyotomi Hideyoshi never left Japan, remaining in the sh\u014dgunal capital of Edo (modern Tokyo); however, the idea of conquering China was his obsession, and throughout the war, he refused to accept defeat, treating the war as simply a question of willpower, believing if only his samurai fought hard enough, he could take China, Turnbull writes: \"In a tactical sense, therefore, Hideyoshi cannot be considered as one of the commanders, but, as his will drove the whole project along until he died, his political influence cannot be underestimated\".<ref>Turnbull, Stephen 2008 p. 14</ref>\n\n====Chinese====\nThe Chinese army was the largest in Asia, with a total of around 845,000 troops. However, in 1592 the Imperial army was engaged in wars with the Mongols and in crushing a rebellion in the south-west.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The Chinese army was  capable of considerable feats of organization, for example bringing 400 artillery guns across 480&nbsp;km of harsh landscape to provide firepower against the Mongols.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The core of the Chinese army was the infantry, divided into five sections; those armed with guns, swords, archers with [[fire arrow]]s, archers with ordinary arrows and spearmen, backed up by the cavalry and artillery.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The basic weapons for the Chinese infantry were the crossbow and the arquebus, while the cavalry were usually mounted archers.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Chinese infantry wore conical iron helmets and suits of armor made from leather or iron.<ref name=\"auto7\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 20.</ref> According to Turnbull (2008), \"Chinese field artillery and siege cannon were the finest in the region\".<ref name=\"auto7\"/> Chinese artillery was made from cast iron, and were divided into several types, the most important were the \"great general gun\" and the ''folang zhi'' (\"Frankish gun\"), the latter being a breech loaded artillery guns copied from the \"Franks\" (i.e. Europeans).<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The Chinese commander was [[Li Rusong]], a man who has been traditionally disparaged in Japanese accounts; in Turnbull estimate, he was \"in fact, one of Ming China's most accomplished generals\".<ref name=\"auto8\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 17.</ref> Although Li was defeated at the battle of P'y\u01d2kjeyek, his defeat was temporary. He was an able strategist who achieved his goal of forcing the Japanese out of Korea, and Japanese accounts focusing on his defeat at P'y\u01d2kjeyek served to distract from his achievements.<ref name=\"auto8\"/>\n\n====Korean====\nOfficers in the Joseon army came exclusively from the aristocracy, but unlike the highly militarist Japanese aristocracy trained to be soldiers from their youth onward, for the Joseon aristocracy scholarship was valued and war was disparaged as something unworthy of a Confucian gentleman-scholar.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 pp. 20\u201321.</ref> The quality of Korean generalship was very variable with some Korean officers being able and others being men who had not devoted much time to the study of war, preferring archery, writing, practicing their calligraphy, and reading Confucian classics.<ref name=\"auto9\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 21.</ref> Korean infantrymen wore a Chinese-style hat and helmet, but no armor.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The standard Korean sword was Hwando a curved sword commonly used by Joseon soldiers during peace time that is shorter, but lighter than its Japanese counterpart.  A uniquely Korean weapon was the [[flail (weapon)|flail]], a {{convert|1.5|m}}-long hardwood stick, painted red, acting as the handle for a chain attached to a shaft with iron nails.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> Joseon infantrymen often fought as archers, and a Japanese source from 1592 commented Koreans were superior as soldiers to the Japanese only as archers because their bows had a range of {{convert|450|m}} against the {{convert|300|m}} of Japanese archers.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\nThe standard Korean gun was the [[chongtong|seungja]] \"victory gun\", a handheld shotgun-like cannon attached to a staff.  Korean artillery however was much superior to Japanese artillery, and unlike the Japanese, the Koreans had built ships capable of carrying [[Korean cannon|heavy cannons]].\n\nTurnbull wrote that Korea's salvation was its navy.<ref name=\"auto10\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 22.</ref> The standard Korean ship was the [[panokseon]], a warship that was not much different from the standard Japanese warships except for the fact that Korean ships carried heavy cannons while the Japanese ships did not.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> The famous \"turtle ships\" that were heavily armored and armed and that were to wreak havoc on the Japanese ships were a minority of the Korean Navy's ships.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> Korean and Japanese accounts both talk much of the \"[[turtle ship]]s\", but no such ship has survived, and historians still debate about what turtle ships looked like, though most now agree that they were in fact turtle-shaped.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], who began the war as the Left Naval Commander{{refn|name=LeftRightNavy01|group=n|\"The Jeolla Navy camp had two headquarters: Jeolla Left Navy and Jeolla Right Navy.\"<ref name=ArchNews2012-12-11a>{{cite web |title=Items From The Sea Recall An Epic Battle|url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2012/12/items-from-sea-recall-epic-battle.html|date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2019 |publisher=Archaeology News Network|quote=The Jeolla Navy camp had two headquarters: Jeolla Left Navy and Jeolla Right Navy.}}</ref>}} of [[Jeolla Province]], was to become the commander of the Korean Navy and was described by Turnbull as \"Korea's greatest hero\" and \"one of the outstanding naval commanders in the entire history of the world\".<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===Military capabilities===\n{{Main|Military history of Korea|Military history of Japan|Military history of China before 1911}}\n[[File:Ashigaru using shields (tate).jpg|thumb|Japanese infantry employing [[fusillade]] tactics using [[Tanegashima (Japanese matchlock)|Tanegashima matchlocks]]]]\n[[File:Tempo-p1000697.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese arquebuses of the [[Edo period]] were used by Japanese soldiers during Hideyoshi's invasions.]]\nThe two major security threats to Joseon and Ming China at the time were the [[Jurchen people]], who raided along the northern borders, and the [[wokou]], who pillaged the coastal villages and trade ships.<ref name=\"Edward26\">Rockstein, Edward D., PhD p.&nbsp;26</ref><ref name=\"turnbull9\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;9.</ref>\n\nThis defensive stance within an environment of relative peace pushed the Koreans to depend on the strength of their fortresses and warships. With the transmission of [[gunpowder]] and [[firearm|firearms technology]] from China during Goryeo, Korea improved upon the original Chinese firearm designs, the [[thunder crash bomb]], and developed advanced cannon which were used with great efficiency at sea. Even though China was the main source of new military technologies in Asia, Korea was a manufacturing base for both cannon and shipbuilding during this era.<ref name=\"SWOPE32\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;32.</ref>\n\nJapan, on the other hand, had been in a [[Sengoku period|state of civil war]] for over a century, which had the result of turning Japan into a very proficient warlike society. When traders from the [[Portuguese Empire]] arrived in Japan and introduced [[arquebus]]es and [[musket]]s, the Japanese warlords were quick to adapt to this [[disruptive innovation]], producing ''en masse'' the [[Tanegashima (gun)|Tanegashima matchlock]]. In the ongoing civil strife, the Japanese refined the [[military parade|drills]] and tactics to make best use of the new weapon, thus giving them a great advantage over the Korean armies.\n\nKorean cannon were not adapted for effective use on land, and firearms were of a less advanced design. The [[small arms]] carried by Japanese soldiers proved to be particularly effective during land engagements and sieges.<ref>Samurai Invasions of Korea, 1592\u20131598, Stephen Turnbull, p. 23</ref> This strategic difference in weapons development and implementation contributed to the trend during the war of Japanese dominance on land and Korean dominance at sea.\n\nAs Japan had been at war since the mid-15th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had half a million battle-hardened soldiers at his disposal<ref name=\"barry3\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;3</ref> to form a remarkable professional army in Asia for the invasion of Korea.<ref name=\"turnbull22\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;22.</ref> While Japan's chaotic state had left the Koreans with a very low estimate of Japan as a military threat,<ref name=\"turnbull22\" /> there was a new sense of unity among the different political factions in Japan, as indicated by the \"[[sword hunt]]\" in 1588 (the confiscation of all weapons from the peasants).<ref name=\"turnbull187\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;187.</ref> Along with the hunt came \"The Separation Edict\" in 1591, which effectively put an end to all Japanese ''wokou'' piracy by prohibiting the daimy\u014ds from supporting the pirates within their fiefs.<ref name=\"turnbull187\" /> Ironically, the Koreans believed that Hideyoshi's invasion would be just an extension of the previous pirate raids that had been repelled before.<ref name=\"turnbull26\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;26.</ref> As for the military situation in Joseon, the Korean scholar official Ryu Seong-ryong observed, \"not one in a hundred [Korean generals] knew the methods of drilling soldiers\":<ref name=\"turnbull15\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> rising in rank depended far more on social connections than military knowledge.<ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen 2002, pp. 16\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Korean soldiers were disorganized, ill-trained, and ill-equipped,<ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen 2002, pp. 16\" /> and they had been used mostly in construction projects such as building castle walls.<ref name=\"tiger12JIMWTC\">{{Cite web\n |last        = Caraway\n |first       = Bill\n |title       = Ch 12 \u2013 Japanese invasions: More Worlds to Conquer\n |work        = Korea in the Eye of the Tiger\n |publisher   = Korea History Project\n |url         = http://koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1202.htm\n |accessdate  = 2007-07-04\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917183025/http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1202.htm\n |archivedate = 2008-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\n====Problems with Joseon defense policies====\n[[File:Chinese Fire Lance with Pellets.JPG|thumb|upright|An illustration of an [[ampulliform]] Chinese fire-lance with a gunpowder charge shooting a blast of flame with lead pellets as coviative projectiles.

For example, the military training center established in 1589 in [[Gyeongsang Province]] recruited mostly men either too young or too old to be good soldiers, augmented by some adventure-seeking aristocrats and slaves buying their freedom, because able-bodied men of the right age, targeted by the policy, had higher priorities such as farming and other economic activities.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\"/>\n\nThe dominant form of the Korean fortresses was the ''sanseong'' (\"mountain fortress\"),<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> which consisted of a stone wall that continued around a mountain in a serpentine fashion.<ref name=\"turnbull22\" /> These walls were poorly designed with little use of towers and [[enfilade and defilade|cross-fire]] positions (usually seen in European fortifications), and were mostly low in height.<ref name=\"turnbull22\" /> It was a wartime policy for these fortresses to serve as [[refuge castle]]s and for everyone to evacuate to one, with those who failed to do so being assumed to be collaborators with the enemy; however, the policy never held any great effect because the fortresses were out of reach for most refugees.<ref name=\"turnbull22\" />\n\n====Troop strength====\nHideyoshi mobilized his army at Nagoya Castle a castle located in the old Hizen Province on [[Kyushu]], newly built for the sole purpose of housing the invasion forces and the reserves. None of the original structures remain, but the castle's ruined foundations survive in the formerly separate town of Chinzei, now part of the city of Karatsu in Saga Prefecture.<ref name=\"turnbull40\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;40.</ref> The first invasion consisted of nine divisions totaling 158,800 men, of which the last two of 21,500 were stationed as reserves on [[Tsushima Island]] and [[Iki Island]], respectively.<ref name=\"turnbull42\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;42.</ref> The Japanese used a total of 320,000 troops throughout the entire war.<ref name=\"barry3\" />\n\nOn the other side, Joseon maintained only a few military units with no field army, and its defense depended heavily on the mobilization of the citizen soldiers in case of emergency.<ref name=\"tiger12JIMWTC\" /> During the first invasion, Joseon deployed a total of 84,500 regular troops throughout, assisted by 22,000 [[Irregular military|irregular volunteers]].<ref name=\"turnbull109\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;109.</ref> Ming troops never numbered more than 60,000 troops in Korea at any point of the war.<ref name=\"SWOPE186\" />\n\n====Weapons====\n[[File:Joseoncannon1.JPG|thumb|Joseon cannons such as this one were extensively used by the Joseon navy]]\n[[File:Hwacha2.jpg|thumb|[[Hwacha]], Joseon's multiple rocket-powered arrow launcher]]\n[[File:Joseon era cannon arrow.jpg|thumb|Large iron-tipped wooden missile fired from [[Korean cannon]]s]]\n\nSince its introduction by the Portuguese traders on the island of [[Tanegashima]] in 1543,<ref name=\"hawley3-7\">Hawley, Samuel. pp.&nbsp;3\u20137.</ref> the arquebus had become widely used in Japan.<ref name=\"hawley6\">Hawley, Samuel. p.&nbsp;6.</ref> While both Korea and China had also been introduced to firearms similar to the Portuguese arquebus, most were older models. The Korean soldiers' small arms were [[hand cannons]] with a simple mechanism and with either a gunstock or wooden shaft attached. After the Japanese diplomats presented the Korean court arquebuses as gifts, the Korean scholar-official Ryu Seong-ryong advocated the use of the new weapon, but the Korean court failed to realize its potency.<ref name=\"turnbull36\" /> In contrast, the Japanese often deployed the arquebus in combination with archery in war.<ref name=\"SWOPE30\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;30.</ref>\n\nDuring siege actions, Chinese deployed [[rattan shield]]s and [[Pavise|iron pavises]] (large shields), reputed to be musket-proof.  The Chinese used a variety of weapons, including the [[Chinese archery|Chinese long bow]],<ref name=\"SWOPE29\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;29.</ref> swords,<ref name=\"SWOPE37\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;37.</ref><ref name=\"SWOPE38\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;38.</ref> firearms, early kinds of [[land mine]]s, and early [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"SWOPE26\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;26.</ref>\n\nThe Koreans also demonstrated massive use of ''[[hwacha]]'' \u2013 multiple rocket-propelled arrows, notably during the Siege of Pyongyang in January 1593. It had the ability to fire up to 200 ''singijeon'', a type of rocket arrow, all at one time. The ''hwacha'' consisted of a two-wheeled cart carrying a board filled with holes into which the ''singijeon'' were inserted.  Although the Chinese had their own rocket arrows, the Chinese opted for hand-carried ''[[hu dun pao]]'', or \"crouching tiger cannons\".\n\nThe Japanese defeated successive Korean armies with a combination of muskets, spears, and swords. While muskets used by the Japanese were superior to Korean bows in terms of penetration and range<ref>Andrade, Tonio. (2016) ''The Gunpowder Age'' p. 184: \"When [our] soldiers are lined up against the enemy ranks, our arrows do not reach the enemy while their musket balls rain down upon us.\"</ref> the former lacked the fire rate of the latter. Numerous battle accounts from the Annal of Joseon dynasty and various essays, diaries of Korean officials and commanders show that musket alone could not ensure victory. By employing both musket and ''arme blanche'' (\"cold steel\", swords, lances, spears, and the like), the Japanese were able to achieve success during the early phase of war. Indeed, the ferocious charge of Japanese troops with spears and swords were often more decisive than with muskets. This was because the Koreans were poorly trained in close combat, and lacked battlefield experience and discipline. Thus Korean soldiers were unable to hold their line against charging Japanese soldiers. The following words from a Korean military official named Shi-eon Lee to the Korean king discusses this weakness:\n<blockquote>The King asked him [Shi-eon Lee], \"You have already told me about the low accuracy of Japanese muskets. Why, then, are Korean armies having great problem with defeating them?\"\n<br />\n[Shi-eon Lee] then answered,\n\"The Korean soldiers cower before the enemy and flee for their lives even before they have engaged the enemy. As for the commanders, they seldom leave their positions because they fear that they might be executed for deserting. However, there is a limit to executing deserting soldiers since there are so many of them. Truly, the Japanese aren't good musketeers, but they advance so rapidly that they appear right in front of the Koreans in the time Koreans can shoot only two arrows. It is said that Koreans are good archers, but they seldom hit the targets when the enemy is too far away, and are too scared to shoot when the enemy is near because they fear Japanese swords. Archery often becomes useless because Koreans, fearing the Japanese arme blanche, can barely shoot. The Japanese are reputed to be good swordsmen, but it is possible for Koreans to draw swords and hold their ground. However, the Koreans seldom do this and merely run for their lives.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = The annual records of the Joseon Dynasty\n| volume= 188 (\u5ba3\u7956 38\u5e74 6\u6708 7\u65e5 / June 5, 1605)\n| url = http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.jsp\n| accessdate = 2013-08-29\n| quote = \"\u4e0a\u66f0: \"\u8207\u6211\u570b\u4eba\u4f55\u5982? \u6216\u66f0: \u2018\u502d\u4e0d\u80fd\u99ac\u6230\u2019 \u4e91, \u7136\u8036?\" \u6642\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u99ac\u6230\u4ea6\u975e\u6975\u96e3\u4e4b\u4e8b\u3002 \u502d\u8cca\u521d\u5247\u4e0d\u80fd, \u7d42\u4ea6\u80fd\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\" \u4e0a\u66f0: \"\u502d\u8cca\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c04, \u800c\u4eba\u83ab\u6562\u6575, \u4f55?\" \u6642\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u6211\u570b\u4eba\u898b\u8cca, \u5247\u5148\u6f70\u4ee5\u8d70\u7232\u80fd\u4e8b\u3002 \u5c07\u5247\u96d6\u4e0d\u5fe0, \u754f\u6709\u8ecd\u5f8b, \u4e0d\u6562\u5148\u8d70\u3002 \u8ecd\u4e4b\u8d70\u8005, \u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u8a85, \u60df\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u8a85, \u662f\u4ee5\u8d70\u8033\u3002 \u502d\u8cca\u96d6\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c04, \u5169\u77e2\u4e4b\u9593, \u5ffd\u7109\u5230\u524d, \u6211\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba\u96d6\u66f0\u5584\u5c04, \u9060\u5247\u4e0d\u4e2d, \u8fd1\u5247\u502d\u528d\u53ef\u754f\u3002 \u767c\u77e2\u4e4b\u5f8c, \u6050\u5176\u77ed\u5175\u4f86\u63a5, \u672a\u5f97\u767c\u77e2, \u5c04\u4ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u6043\u77e3\u3002 \u502d\u96d6\u5584\u7528\u528d, \u6211\u570b\u4eba\u82e5\u6301\u528d\u800c\u9032, \u5247\u53ef\u4ee5\u6575\u77e3\u3002 \u6211\u570b\u4eba\u5247\u4e0d\u80fd\u5982\u6b64, \u7686\u4ee5\u8d70\u7232\u5584\u7b56, \u8d70\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ca, \u5247\u7232\u8cca\u6240\u6bba\u3002 \u8cca\u898b\u6211\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba, \u6216\u8d70\u6216\u6b7b, \u6a02\u7232\u4e4b\u8d74\u6230\u3002 \u662f\u4ee5, \u502d\u4e4b\u6c23\u589e\u9577; \u6211\u4e4b\u6c23\u6cae\u55aa\u77e3\u3002\"}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe Koreans seldom employed field artillery, with cannon being mainly used in siege action and for defending castles.

One of the notable Chinese field guns was the \"Great General Cannon\", a large breech-loading cannon with a two-wheeled cart, shooting an iron ball weighing about 10 kilograms. The Japanese employed field artillery only where strategically advantageous in both siege and field warfare situations, often using captured pieces where available.\n\nThe Koreans actively deployed their cavalry divisions in action. But the terrain was often mountainous, which was not generally suitable for cavalry, the farmland tended to have many ditches, and it was often barren and lacked grass essential for feeding the horses. In addition, Japanese use of the arquebus at long range and in concentrated volleys negated any possibility of effective cavalry tactics.<ref name=\"SWOPE38\" /> Korean cavalrymen's primary weapons were bows, with swords and lances holding only subsidiary positions.

Because of advanced artillery and shipbuilding technology, along with an extensive naval history against Japanese pirates, the Korean navies fielded highly advanced and formidable ships. By the time of the Japanese invasion, Korea employed the ''[[panokseon]]'', a powerful galley-type ship armed with cannon that outranged most Japanese vessels. The Korean Navy used this naval superiority to disrupt the Japanese logistical network off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. This advantage, however, did not affect Japan's ability to continuously reinforce its armies through the supply route from Tsushima in Japan to [[Busan]] in Korea, especially once Korean naval bases in the immediate area were neutralized by Japanese ground forces. The Korean navy led by [[Yi Sun-sin]] would withdraw and re-base in the northern border of [[Jeolla Province]]. While not able to entirely prevent reinforcement, the Korean navy continued to harass and inflict losses on the Japanese supply fleets throughout the duration of the war.\n\nAs virtually all Japanese ships in the first phase of the war lacked cannon artillery,<ref name=\"SWOPE32\" /> Korean ships outranged and bombarded Japanese ships with impunity outside the range of the Japanese muskets, arrows, and catapults.<ref name=\"SWOPE32\" /> When the Japanese attempted to outfit cannon to their ships,<ref name=\"Brown252\">Brown, Delmer M., p.&nbsp;252</ref> their lightweight ship design prohibited using more than a few per vessel, and vessels usually lacked the firepower or range of their Korean counterparts.<ref name=\"barry9\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;9</ref> In order to bolster their fleet, the Japanese considered employing two Portuguese galleons in the invasion.<ref name=\"Brown243\">Brown, Delmer M., p.&nbsp;243</ref>\n\nIn addition to a lack of effective naval armament, most Japanese ships were modified merchant vessels more suited for transportation of troops and equipment than fielding artillery weapons.<ref name=\"SWOPE32\" /><ref name=\"barry10\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;10</ref>\n\n====Ongoing Bozhou Miao rebellion in China====\nThe [[Bozhou rebellion]] by the [[Chiefdom of Bozhou]] which lasted from (1589\u20131600) was going on in Bozhou ([[Zunyi]], [[Guizhou]]) in southwestern China at the same time as the Imjin war in Korea.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swope |first1=Kenneth M. |editor1-last=Aung-Thwin |editor1-first=Michael Arthur |editor2-last=Hall |editor2-first=Kenneth R. |title=New Perspectives on the History and Historiography of Southeast Asia: Continuing Explorations |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1136819649 |pages=122\u2013125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvWrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 |chapter=6 To catch a tiger The Eupression of the Yang Yinglong Miao uprising (1578-1600) as a case study in Ming military and borderlands history}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Xie |first1=Xiaohui |editor1-last=Faure |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Ho |editor2-first=Ts'ui-p'ing |title=Chieftains into Ancestors: Imperial Expansion and Indigenous Society in Southwest China |date=2013 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774823712 |pages=118\u2013120 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNBTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120 |chapter=5 From Woman's Fertility to Masculine Authority: The Story of the White Emperor Heavenly Kings in Western Hunan}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Herman |first1=John E. |title=Amid the Clouds and Mist: China's Colonization of Guizhou, 1200\u20131700 |date=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |isbn=0674025911 |pages=164, 165, 281 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWxwAAAAMAAJ&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEIMjAC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ness |first1=John Philip |title=The Southwestern Frontier During the Ming Dynasty |date=1998 |publisher=University of Minnesota |pages=139, 140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI9U6sj_NWMC&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEINTAD}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The country of streams and grottoes |date=1987 |isbn=0674175433 |pages=126, 132, 133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqFQAQAAIAAJ&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEIOjAE}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Swope |first1=Kenneth |title=The Three Great Campaigns of the Wanli Emperor, 1592\u20131600: court, military and society in late sixteenth-century China |date=2001 |publisher=University of Michigan |pages=387, 411, 442 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7wfAQAAMAAJ&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEIPjAF}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Liew |editor1-first=Foon Ming |title=The Treatises on Military Affairs of the Ming Dynastic History (1368\u20131644): An Annotated Translation of the Treatises on Military Affairs, Chapter 89 and Chapter 90 : Supplemented by the Treatises on Military Affairs of the Draft of the Ming Dynastic History : a Documentation of Ming ..., Part 1 |date=1998 |publisher=Ges.f.

Kwon Yul quickly advanced northwards, re-taking Suwon and then swung north toward Haengju where he would wait for Chinese reinforcements.

The battle is celebrated today as one of the three most decisive Korean victories (the other two being the [[Siege of Jinju (1592)]] and the [[Battle of Hansando]]).

The Japanese lacked sufficient supplies to move north, and the defeat at Pyongyang had caused part of the Japanese leadership such as [[Konishi Yukinaga]] and [[Ishida Mitsunari]] to seriously consider negotiating with the Ming dynasty forces. This got them into a heated debate with other hawkish generals such as [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]], and these conflicts would eventually have further implications following the war in Japan when the two sides became rivals in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]].\n\nThe Ming forces had their own set of problems. Soon after arriving in Korea the Ming officials began to note the inadequate logistical supply from the Korean court. The records by [[Qian Shizhen]] noted that even after the siege of Pyongyang the Ming forces were already stalled for nearly a week due to the lack of supplies, before moving on to [[Kaesong]].<ref>Statements in \"The records of the Eastern Expedition\" by [[Qian Shizhen]]</ref> As the time went on the situation only become more serious.

Even though the court had assigned the majority of the men on hand to tackle the situation, their desire to reclaim their country, along with the militarily inexperienced nature of many of their administrators, resulted in their continual requests to the Ming forces to advance despite the situation. These events created an increasing level of distrust between the two sides.\n\nThough by mid April 1593, faced with ever-greater logistical pressure from a Korean naval blockade of Yi Sun-sin in addition to a Ming force special operation that managed to burn down a very significant portion of the Japanese grain storage,<ref>[http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E6%98%8E%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7238#.E5.AD.90_.E5.A6.82.E6.9D.BE The history of Ming chapter 238] \u805e\u502d\u5c07\u5e73\u79c0\u5609\u64da\u9f8d\u5c71\u5009\uff0c\u7a4d\u7c9f\u6578\u5341\u842c\uff0c\u5bc6\u4ee4\u5927\u53d7\u7387\u6b7b\u58eb\u5f9e\u9593\u711a\u4e4b\u3002\u502d\u9042\u4e4f\u98df\u3002</ref> the Japanese broke off talks and pulled out of Hanseong.\n\n===Second Siege of Jinju===\n{{Main|Siege of Jinju (1593)}}\n\nUnlike the First Siege of Jinju, the second siege resulted in a Japanese victory.

The soldiers inside the tortoise wagons were also burned and retreated\".<ref name=\"auto28\"/> On 27 July the Japanese again attacked with the \"tortoise shell wagons\", but this time, there was a heavy thunderstorm that prevented Korean attempts to incinerate the Japanese by dropping torches soaked in fat.<ref name=\"auto30\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.71</ref> The Japanese sappers broke down a section of the wall and a great rush broke out with the samurai pushed each other down as it was a great honor to be the first samurai to enter a fortress.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> Goto Mototsgu, a retainer of Kuroda was about to be the first samurai to enter Jinju when Iida Kakbei, a retainer of Kato's, threw the Nichiren flag into the breach to claim that honor for himself.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> The Korean garrison was out of ammunition and were short of swords, so many Koreans fought with wooden sticks against the onrush of samurai armed with ''katanas''.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> One Korean, General S\u014f Yewon engaged in a lengthy single combat with a samurai named Okamoto Gonjo, which ended when the wounded General S\u014f lost his breath and fell down by a tree, and Okamoto took the chance to sever his head with a single blow from his ''katana''.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> S\u014f's head fell down by the Nam river, which as it was a great honor for a samurai to take the head of their enemies, led Okamoto to order a search to find S\u014f's head, so that it could be salted and taken back to Japan.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> The Korean commander, General Kim, committed suicide.<ref name=\"auto30\"/>\n\nAs usual, the Japanese took no prisoners, killing almost everyone both military and civilian, and the Nam river ran red with blood as thousands attempted to swim across the Nam, only to be cut down by the samurai waiting on the other side.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> The chronicler of the Kato family noted: \"All the Chinese were terrified of our Japanese blades, and jumped into the river, but we pulled them and cut off their heads\".<ref name=\"auto30\"/> Korean accounts mention that almost all of the 60,000 soldiers in Jinju were killed while Japanese accounts mention the samurai sent 20,000 heads back to Japan after their victory.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> Only the ''kisaneng'' (courtesans) of Jinju were spared as they pressed to service the victorious Japanese generals at a party they held to celebrate their victory on the evening of the same day at the Ch'oks\u014fngu Pavilion on a nearby hill as it offered the best view of the \"hellish scene\" below them.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> One courtesan, Nongae, attracted the attention of a samurai, Keyamura Rokunosuke, whom she lured to a cliff by promising him sex, and then threw both herself and him off the cliff, becoming a national heroine in Korea.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.71 & 74</ref> Jinju was taken only for symbolic purposes, and instead of advancing, the Japanese force at Jinju retreated back to Busan as there was a larger Chinese force to the north.<ref name=\"auto31\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p. 74</ref> Hideyoshi was well satisfied that he had avenged the defeat of 1592 at Jinju, through Turnbull argued that to lose so many men to take a town only for symbolic reasons was wasteful.<ref name=\"auto31\"/>\n\n==Negotiations and truce between China and Japan (1594\u20131596)==\n[[File:Ming army2.JPG|thumb|Painting of the Ming Army camped in [[Ningxia]]]]\n\nThere were two factors that triggered the Japanese to withdraw: first, a Chinese commando penetrated Hanseong (present-day Seoul) and burned storehouses at Yongsan, destroying most of what was left of the Japanese troops' depleted stock of food. Secondly, Shen Weijing made another appearance to conduct negotiations, and threatened the Japanese with an attack by 400,000 Chinese. The Japanese under Konishi and Kato, aware of their weak situation, agreed to withdraw to the Pusan area while the Chinese would withdraw back to China. A ceasefire was imposed, and a Ming emissary was sent to Japan to discuss peace terms.<ref>Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 4, Early Modern Japan, p. 281.</ref> For the next three years, there was little fighting as the Japanese retained control of a few coastal fortresses with the rest of Korea being controlled by the Koreans.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.75</ref>\n\nBy May 18, 1594, all the Japanese soldiers had retreated to the area around Busan and many began to make their way back to Japan. The Ming government withdrew most of its expeditionary force, but kept 16,000 men on the Korean peninsula to guard the truce.\n\nOnce peace negotiations between China and Japan finally got underway, Chinese negotiators gave the Ming Emperor the mistaken impression that he was about to deal with a minor state that had been subdued by war. Furthermore, they conveyed the idea that the Japanese regent, Hideyoshi, was prepared to become his vassal. Under such conditions, the Chinese sought to resolve the issue in their favor by including Japan in their tributary system of foreign relations. They would establish Hideyoshi as king of Japan and grant him the privilege of formal tribute trade relations with the Ming dynasty.\n\nIn Japan, Hideyoshi's negotiators apparently led him to believe that China was suing for peace and was ready to accept him as their emperor. Thus, Hideyoshi issued the demands of a victor; first, a daughter of the Ming emperor must be sent to become the wife of the Japanese emperor; second, the southern provinces of Joseon must be ceded to Japan; third, normal trade relations between China and Japan must be restored; and fourth, a Joseon prince and several high-ranking government officials must be sent to Japan as hostages.\n\nBargaining from such fundamentally different perspectives, there was no prospect whatsoever for success in the talks. Early in 1597, both sides resumed hostilities.<ref name=\"tiger12JITHF\">{{Cite web\n |last=Caraway\n |first=Bill\n |title=Ch 12 \u2013 Japanese invasions: The Home Front\n |work=Korea in the Eye of the Tiger\n |publisher=Korea History Project\n |url=http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1204.htm\n |accessdate=2007-07-04\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403230844/http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1204.htm\n |archivedate=2009-04-03\n}}</ref>\n\n==Korean military reorganization==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n\n=== Proposal for military reforms ===\nDuring the period between the First and Second invasions, the Korean government had a chance to examine the reasons why they had been easily overrun by the Japanese. Ryu Seong-ryong, the Prime Minister, spoke out about the Korean disadvantages.\n\nRyu pointed out that Korean castle defenses were extremely weak, a fact which he had pointed out before the war. He noted how Korean castles had incomplete fortifications and walls that were too easy to scale. He also wanted cannons set up in the walls. Ryu proposed building strong towers with gun turrets for cannons. Besides castles, Ryu wanted to form a line of defenses in Korea. In this kind of defense, the enemy would have to scale many walls in order to reach Hanseong (Seoul).\n\nRyu also pointed out how efficient the Japanese army was, since it took them only one month to reach Hanseong, and how well organized they were. He noted how the Japanese moved their units in complex maneuvers, often weakening their enemy with the use of arquebuses, then attacking with [[M\u00eal\u00e9e weapon|melee weapons]].\n\n===Military Training Agency===\n[[King Seonjo]] and the Korean court finally began to reform the military. In September 1593, the Military Training Agency (\ud6c8\ub828\ub3c4\uac10, alternately translated as Military Training Command) was established. The agency carefully divided the army into units and companies. Within the companies were squads of archers, arquebusiers, swordsmen, and spear infantry. The agency set up divisional units in each region of Korea and garrisoned battalions at castles. The agency, which originally had less than 80 troops, soon grew to about 10,000.\n\nOne of the most important changes was that both upper class citizens and slaves were subject to the draft. All males had to enter military service be trained and familiarized with weapons.\n\nIt was also around this time that the military scholar [[Han Gyo]] (\ud55c\uad50) wrote the martial arts manual [[Muyejebo]], based on the book [[Jixiao Xinshu]] by the famous Chinese general [[Qi Jiguang]].\n\n==Second invasion (1597\u20131598)==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 30em; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; clear: right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" | Japanese second invasion wave<ref name=\"Sansom 1961, p353\" />\n|-\n| Army of the Right\n|-\n|\n| [[M\u014dri Hidemoto]]\n| 30,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]]\n| 10,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Kuroda Nagamasa]]\n| 5,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Nabeshima Naoshige]]\n| 12,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Ikeda Hideuji]]\n| 2,800\n|-\n|\n| [[Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika]]\n| 3,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Nakagawa Hidenari]]\n| 2,500\n|-\n| Subtotal\n|\n| '''65,300'''\n|-\n| Army of the Left\n|-\n|\n| [[Ukita Hideie]]\n| 10,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Konishi Yukinaga]]\n| 7,000\n|-\n|\n| [[S\u014d Yoshitoshi]]\n| 1,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Matsura Shigenobu]]\n| 3,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Arima Harunobu]]\n| 2,000\n|-\n|\n| [[\u014cmura Yoshiaki]]\n| 1,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Got\u014d Sumiharu]]\n| 700\n|-\n|\n| [[Hachisuka Iemasa]]\n| 7,200\n|-\n|\n| [[M\u014dri Yoshinari]]\n| 2,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Ikoma Kazumasa]]\n| 2,700\n|-\n|\n| [[Shimazu Yoshihiro]]\n| 10,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Shimazu Tadatsune]]\n| 800\n|-\n|\n| [[Akizuki Tanenaga]]\n| 300\n|-\n|\n| [[Takahashi Mototane]]\n| 600\n|-\n|\n| [[It\u014d Suketaka]]\n| 500\n|-\n|\n| [[Sagara Yorifusa]]\n| 800\n|-\n| Subtotal\n|\n| '''49,600'''\n|-\n| Naval Command\n|-\n|\n| [[T\u014dd\u014d Takatora]]\n| 2,800\n|-\n|\n| [[Kat\u014d Yoshiaki]]\n| 2,400\n|-\n|\n| [[Wakisaka Yasuharu]]\n| 1,200\n|-\n|\n| [[Kurushima Michifusa]]\n| 600\n|-\n|\n| [[Mitaira Saemon]]\n| 200\n|-\n| Subtotal\n|\n| '''7,200'''\n|-\n| Total\n|\n| '''122,100'''\n|}\n\nAfter the failed peace negotiations of the inter-war years, Hideyoshi launched the second invasion of Korea. One of the main strategic differences between the first and second invasions was that conquering China was no longer an explicit goal for the Japanese. Failing to gain a foothold during Kat\u014d Kiyomasa's Chinese campaign and the near complete withdrawal of the Japanese forces during the first invasion had established that the Korean peninsula was the more prudent and realistic objective.\n\nSoon after the Chinese ambassadors had safely returned to China in 1597, Hideyoshi sent approximately 200 ships with an estimated 141,100 men under the overall command of [[Kobayakawa Hideaki]].<ref name=\"turnbull187\" /> Japan's second force arrived unopposed on the southern coast of Gyeongsang Province in 1596.

In the early Autumn of 1597, the Japanese began a more focused and sustained advance. The Japanese planned to attack [[Jeollanam-do|Jeolla Province]] in the southwestern part of the peninsula and eventually occupy [[Jeonju]], the provincial capital. Korean success in the [[Siege of Jinju (1593)|Siege of Jinju]] in 1592 had mostly saved this area from devastation during the first invasion. Two Japanese armies, under [[M\u014dri Hidemoto]] and [[Ukita Hideie]], began the assault in Busan and marched towards Jeonju, taking Sacheon and Changpyong along the way.\n\n====Plot to dismiss Yi Sun-sin====\n[[File:Navalzhugenu2.jpg|thumb|240px|A naval battle.

Government officials gave direct orders to launch a surprise naval operation against the Japanese, based on a tip from a presumed reliable Japanese spy. Yi refused to obey these orders, knowing that this was an obvious trap meant to have his own fleet sail in to an ambush. This development allowed others within the court to further advance their personal agendas while Yi was severely punished. Ultimately, Won Gyun was appointed in Yi Sun-sin's place at the head of the Korean navy.\n\n====Battle of Chilcheollyang====\n{{Main|Battle of Chilcheollyang}}\nAfter Won Gyun replaced Yi Sun-sin as head of the navy, he was quick to take action and justify his newly acquired position. He gathered the entire Korean fleet, which now had more than 100 ships outside of Yosu, to search for the Japanese. Without any previous preparations or planning, Won Gyun then had his entire fleet sail towards Busan.\n\nAfter one day at sea, Won Gyun was informed of a large Japanese fleet near Busan. He decided to attack immediately, despite reports of exhaustion among the crew of the ship.\n\nAt the subsequent [[Battle of Chilcheollyang]], Won Gyun was completely outmaneuvered by the Japanese in a surprise attack. His ships were overwhelmed by arquebus fire and the traditional Japanese boarding attacks, which largely resulted in the destruction of his entire fleet. But the defection before the battle of Bae Soel, an officer who did not submit to Won Gyun's leadership, kept thirteen panokseons out of the battle. These would form the entire fighting force of the Korean Navy during the immediately following months.\n\nThe Battle of Chilcheollyang was one of Japan's most decisive naval victories of the war. Won Gyun was himself killed by a Japanese garrison after he struggled ashore on an island after the destruction of his flagship. The victory allowed the Japanese navy to safely escort its troop ships and to support planned landing operations.<ref>National Library of Australian Cataloguing-in-Publication entry, Japanese Sea Power: A Maritime Nation\u2019s Struggle for Identity, Sajima, N (Naoko), 1959\u2013.

The garrison of [[Namwon]] became their next key target.\n\nNamwon was located fifty kilometres southeast of Jeonju. Correctly predicting a Japanese attack, a coalition force of 6,000 soldiers (including 3,000 Chinese troops under [[Yang Yuan]] and civilian volunteers) were prepared to fight the approaching Japanese forces.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;191.</ref> The Japanese laid siege to the walls of the fortress with ladders and siege towers.<ref>\u8107\u5742\u7d00, \u592a\u7530 \u85e4\u56db\u90ce and \u5859 \u4fdd\u5df1\u4e00, editors, \u7d9a\u7fa4\u66f8\u985e\u5f93 [Zoku Gunsho Ruiju Series], 1933, p.&nbsp;448.</ref> The two sides exchanged volleys with arquebuses and bows.

When [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]] laid siege to the mountain with the Army of the Right, which he attacked at night under the full moon, the Koreans lost morale and retreated with 350 casualties.<ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen page 82\"/> The successful siege did not, however, lead to a subsequent advance from beyond Gyeongsang Province.\n\n====First Korean and Ming counter offensive====\nUpon the start of the second invasion, the Ming emperor was furious about the entire deb\u00e2cle of the peace talks and turned his wrath on many of its chief supporters; particularly [[Shi Xing]], the Minister of War, who was removed from his position and jailed (he died several years later, in prison). The chief negotiator, [[Shen Weijing]], was executed. [[Xing Jie]] was named the new minister of war and [[Yang Hao (Ming dynasty)|Yang Hao]] as the new chief superintendent (Jin Lue) of Korea; Xing Jie himself was also stationed in Korea for the remainder of the war. The Ming leadership quickly pulled in many units stationed near its border with Korea.\n\n====Battle of Jiksan====\n{{Main|Battle of Jiksan}}\n\nAfter the steady Japanese advances on land, they were planned to assault Hanseong (present-day Seoul) by late August or early September 1597. However, the plans were foiled by a Ming defense around Jiksan (modern day [[Cheonan]]).\n\nForces under [[Kuroda Nagamasa]] formed the vanguard of the right army and marched toward Hanseong, which deeply disturbed the court at Hanseong. Several of the Ming generals stationed in Korea suggested to the court that they pull back their forces until they could gather more reinforcements, but the Ming administrators overruled their generals and ordered them to make a stand.

Konishi, Shimazu, Kat\u014d Kiyomasa and other Japanese generals of the Left Army congregated in Pusan and withdrew to Japan on December 21. The last ships sailed to Japan on December 24, bringing an end to seven years of war.\n\n==Postwar negotiations==\nAs Tsushima had suffered greatly from its loss of trade with Korea as a result of the invasions, Yoshitoshi of the S\u014d family, then dominant in Tsushima, undertook the lead in the peace negotiations by Japan. He sent four peace missions to Joseon in 1599 to normalize relations. The first three were captured and sent directly to Beijing by Chinese troops, but the fourth one, in 1601, successfully obtained from the Joseon court the promise of a normalizing of relations upon the return of remaining Joseon captives.<ref name=\"turnbull235\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;235.</ref> As Ming troops continued to be present in Korea following the withdrawal of Japanese forces, the major incentive for Joseon for the normalization of relations with Japan was the withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers from their territory. The Ming Chinese themselves were causing havoc, and their presence continued to strain Joseon's national economy and infrastructure.<ref name=\"turnbull235\" /> In response to the Joseon request, Yoshitoshi promptly released several Joseon prisoners and between 1603 and 1604 helped the Joseon envoys to repatriate a further 3,000 by organizing negotiations at Kyoto with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], by then the Shogun of Japan.<ref name=\"turnbull235\" />\n\nIn the continuation of the diplomatic talks toward peaceful relations, Joseon in 1606 expanded its conditions and demanded that the Shogun write a formal letter requesting peace, and to extradite the Japanese soldiers who had defiled the [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty|Joseon Royal Tombs]] near Hanseong (Seoul).<ref name=\"turnbull235\" /> Realizing that the Shogunate would never agree to such a request, Yoshitoshi sent a forged letter and a group of criminals instead; the great need to expel the Ming soldiers pushed Joseon into accepting and to send an emissary in 1608.<ref name=\"turnbull235\" /> The end result was a return of Joseon prisoners and the restoration of diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.<ref name=\"turnbull236\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;236.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and conclusion==\n[[File:Port of Yeosu.jpg|thumb|Yeosu in 2005.

After Hideyoshi's death, his young son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] became head of the [[Toyotomi clan]]. However, the losses suffered by varying ''daimy\u014ds'' during the campaign were a contributing factor to the imbalance of power in Japan after the war. As the western-based daimy\u014d of Kyushu and western Honshu (partially by geographic convenience) contributed the majority of the forces used during the Korean conflict, it left the pro-Hideyoshi alliance weakened for the eventual struggle with the mostly eastern-backed forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu (who himself never sent forces to Korea). Tokugawa would go on to unify Japan and establish himself as Shogun in 1603, following the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]] against a coalition of mostly western-based ''daimy\u014ds''.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;233.</ref>\n\nMing China also sustained a heavy financial burden for its role in defending Korea while also fighting several other conflicts in the same decade. The war also indirectly weakened China's position in Manchuria, which gave the fledgling Manchu chieftain Nurhachi an opportunity to expand his influence and territory. Nurhachi's expansions would culminate in the eventual collapse of the Ming Dynasty and the rise of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644.<ref name=\"barry21\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;21.</ref> However, the [[sinocentric]] tributary system that the Ming had defended continued to be maintained by the Qing, and ultimately, the war resulted in a maintenance of the status quo \u2013 with the re-establishment of trade and the normalization of relations between all three parties.<ref name=\"SWOPE758-9\">Swope. 2002. pp.&nbsp;758\u201359.</ref>\n\nGiven that the conflict was fought exclusively on Korean soil, Korea ultimately suffered the most damage of the three participants.<ref name=\"barry21\" /> It lost a large portion of its military strength and civilian population, had numerous cultural heritage sites damaged or destroyed, and many of its technological advancements pillaged.<ref name=\"Elisonas\" >Jurgis Elisonas, \"The inseparable trinity:Japan's relations with China and Korea\", in [[John Whitney Hall]] (ed.)

The first phase of the invasion lasted from 1592 until 1596, and was followed by ultimately unsuccessful peace negotiations between Japan and the Ming between 1596 and 1597.\n\nIn 1597, Japan renewed its offensive by invading Korea a second time. The pattern of the second invasion largely mirrored that of the first. The Japanese had initial successes on land, capturing several cities and fortresses, only to be halted and forced to withdraw to the southern coastal regions of the peninsula. The pursuing Ming and Joseon forces, however, were unable to dislodge the Japanese from their remaining fortresses and entrenched positions in the southern coastal areas,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Annals of the Joseon Dynasty Korean language http://sillok.history.go.kr/id/kna_13110012_007</ref><ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen 2002, p. 222\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;222.

Final peace negotiations between the parties followed afterwards and continued for several years, ultimately resulting in the normalization of relations.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen; Samurai Invasions of Korea 1592\u20131598, pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\n==Names==\nIn [[Korean language|Korean]], the first invasion (1592\u20131593) is called the \"Japanese ([[Wa (Japan)|\u502d ''wae'']]) Disturbance ([[wikt:\u4e82|\u4e82 ''ran'']]) of Imjin\" (1592 being an ''imjin'' year in the [[sexagenary cycle]]). The second invasion (1597\u20131598) is called the \"Second War of Jeong-yu\" (\u4e01\u9149). Collectively, the invasions are referred to as the '''Imjin War'''.\n\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the wars are referred to as the \"[[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] Korean Campaign\", after the reigning [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]], or the \"Renchen War to Defend the Nation\" (\u58ec\u8fb0\u885b\u570b\u6230\u722d), where ''renchen'' (\u58ec\u8fb0) is the Chinese reading of ''imjin''.\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the war is called ''[[Bunroku]] no eki'' (\u6587\u7984\u306e\u5f79). ''Bunroku'' referring to the [[Japanese era name]] of [[Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei]], spanning the period from 1592 to 1596. The second invasion (1597\u20131598) is called \"''[[Keich\u014d]] no eki''\" (\u6176\u9577\u306e\u5f79). During the [[Edo period]] (17\u201319th centuries), the war was also called \"''Kara iri''\" (\u5510\u5165\u308a \"entry into China\"), because Japan's ultimate purpose at the commencement of the invasion was the conquest of Ming China, although with the reality that the conflict was largely confined to the Korean Peninsula for the duration of the war, the armies of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] would alter their immediate objectives during the course of the campaign.\n\n==Overview==\nIn 1592, with an army of approximately 158,000 troops, Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched what would end up being the first of two invasions of Korea, with the intent of conquering Joseon Korea and eventually Ming-dynasty China. Initially, the Japanese forces saw overwhelming success on land, capturing both [[Hanseong]], the capital of Korea, and Pyongyang, and completing the occupation of large portions of the Korean Peninsula in three months. The Japanese forces, well trained, confident, and experienced after the numerous battles and conflicts of the [[Sengoku period]], typically held the field in most land engagements. This success on land, however, was constrained by the naval campaigns of the Korean navy which would continue to raid Japanese supply fleets in its coastal waters, hampering the Japanese advances as supply lines were disrupted along the Western Korean coast and Japanese naval reinforcements were repelled.<ref>{{cite book |last= Tucker|first= Spencer|date= December 23, 2009|title= A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|url= https://books.google.com/?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&dq=imjin+war+japanese+reinforcements+defeat|publisher= ABC-CLIO|page= 881|isbn= 9781851096725}} \"These [Korean] victories led the Japanese to send naval reinforcements...

Hideyoshi was also tempted by an external conflict to prevent internal rebellion within Japan, which would keep his newly-formed state united against a common enemy, and prevent the ''daimy\u014ds'' from acting on any ambitions against his rule. Fighting a war away from Japanese territory would also prevent territorial destruction, and maintain the infrastructure of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samurai-archives.com/hak.html|title=Hideyoshi and Korea|author=|date=|website=samurai-archives.com}}</ref> Such considerations would be consistent with the fact that Hideyoshi was not Sh\u014dgun and had no links with the imperial bloodline.\n\nTurnbull also suggests personal ambition and megalomania of Hideyoshi as reasons for the invasion. Hideyoshi had in a series of wars conquered Japan and now wanted to turn to bigger things, noting that he spoke not only of his desire to \"slash his way\" into Korea to conquer China, but also to conquer Taiwan (then not part of China), the Philippines, and India.<ref name=\"auto2\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Opsrey, 2008 p. 6.</ref> Furthermore, for thousands of years, China had been the intellectual, economic, military and political center of East Asia, and traditionally, the states of East Asia had acknowledged the Emperors of China as their overlords and paid tribute in exchange for being allowed to trade with China. Japan had usually resisted the demand to pay tribute to China, but Sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu had acknowledged the Emperor of China as his overlord in return for access to the huge Chinese market.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Japan's right to pay tribute and, with it, the right to trade with China was ended in the 1540s by the Ming court in response to raids by Sino-Japanese pirates known as the [[Wokou|''wak\u014d'']].<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nBy seeking to conquer China, Hideyoshi was in effect claiming for Japan the role traditionally played by China in East Asia as the center of the East Asian international order, which would have rallied much support in Japan around a man of relatively humble origins who owed his position only to his military might.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Opsrey, 2008 p. 7.</ref> Finally, during the 1540s\u20131550s, the ''wak\u014d'' had staged a series of raids into China and Korea, some of which were so large as to be \"mini-invasions\" that caused much devastation. That seemed to suggest to Hideyoshi that both Korea and China were weak nations; if both had much difficulty in countering the ''wak\u014d'', how would they fare if they were faced with an army of battle-hardened samurai?<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHideyoshi planned for a possible war with Korea long before he had completed the unification of Japan. He made preparations on many fronts.

The samurai caste owned most of the land in Japan, had the sole right to carry swords and to execute on the spot any commoner who was insufficiently deferential, and were allowed to own horses and ride into battle.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The standard samurai weapon by 1592 was the [[yari]], a spear meant to stab, often with a cross-blade that allowed a samurai to pull his opponent from his horse.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> If samurai wished to cut his opponent rather than stab, the weapons were the [[\u014ddachi]], an extremely long sword with a huge handle, or the [[naginata]], a polearm with very sharp curved blade.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The most famous of all the samurai weapons was the [[katana]], a sword described by the British military historian Stephen Turnbull as \"...the finest edged weapon in the history of warfare\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Samurai never carried shields, with the ''katana'' being used to deflect blows.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> By 1592, the armor of the samurai was [[Lamellar armour|lamellae]] made from iron or leather scales tied together which had been modified to include solid plate to help protect the samurai from bullets.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Samurai engaged in psychological warfare by wearing an iron mask into battle with a mustache made of horsehair and a \"sinister grin\" attached to the outside.<ref name=\"auto4\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 19.</ref> The majority of the Japanese soldiers sent into Korea were ''[[ashigaru]]'' (infantrymen), who were usually conscripted peasants armed with spears, [[Tanegashima (gun)|tanegashima]] (Japanese arquebuses), or [[yumi]] (Japanese bows).<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 19</ref> Unlike the samurai with their expensive suits of armor, the ''ashigaru'' wore cheap suits of iron armour around their chests.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The ''ashigaru'' armed with arquebuses were trained to fight in the European style, with the men trained to fire their guns in formation to create a volley of fire, then to go down on their knees to reload, while the men behind them fired, and the cycle repeated over and over again.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nThe commander of the Japanese First Division and overall commander of the invasion force was [[Konishi Yukinaga]], a ''daimy\u014d'' (lord) of Uto from [[Higo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], chosen as commander of the invasion force more because of his diplomatic skills than military skills as Toyotomi Hideyoshi did not expect the Koreans to resist.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Konishi had converted to Catholicism in 1583, and was known to the Spanish and Portuguese as Dom Agostinho.<ref name=\"auto5\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 15.</ref> [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]] who led the Second Division into Korea was known in Japan as ''Toranosuke'' (\"the young tiger\") and to the Koreans as the \"devil general\" on the account of his ferocity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Kat\u014d was one of the \"Seven Spears of Shizugatake\", a group of seven samurai who distinguished himself in combat at the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, where samurai had fought one another ''mano a mano'', and where Kat\u014d demonstrated his skills with a cross-bladed spear with great effect by cutting so many men, whose severed and salted heads were thereafter tied to a stalk of green bamboo and carried by one of Kat\u014d's attendants into battle.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Kat\u014d was a devoted follower of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], a type of Buddhism closely associated with militarism and ultra-nationalism in Japan, and his relations with the [[Catholic Church in Japan|Catholic Konishi]] were extremely unfriendly, to the extent that the two men almost never met during the campaign in Korea.<ref name=\"auto6\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 16.</ref> Kat\u014d's battle standard was a white pennant which carried a message alleged to be have been written by Nichiren himself reading ''[[Namu My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d]]'' (\"Hail to the Lotus of the Divine Law\").<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The naval commander was Wakizaka Yashuaru, another of the \"Seven Spears of Shizugatake\", who had been named ''daimy\u014d'' of the island of Awaji in the Inland Sea in 1585, where he learned much about seafaring as the island is located close to whirlpools which are notoriously dangerous for sailors.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Toyotomi Hideyoshi never left Japan, remaining in the sh\u014dgunal capital of Edo (modern Tokyo); however, the idea of conquering China was his obsession, and throughout the war, he refused to accept defeat, treating the war as simply a question of willpower, believing if only his samurai fought hard enough, he could take China, Turnbull writes: \"In a tactical sense, therefore, Hideyoshi cannot be considered as one of the commanders, but, as his will drove the whole project along until he died, his political influence cannot be underestimated\".<ref>Turnbull, Stephen 2008 p. 14</ref>\n\n====Chinese====\nThe Chinese army was the largest in Asia, with a total of around 845,000 troops. However, in 1592 the Imperial army was engaged in wars with the Mongols and in crushing a rebellion in the south-west.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The Chinese army was  capable of considerable feats of organization, for example bringing 400 artillery guns across 480&nbsp;km of harsh landscape to provide firepower against the Mongols.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The core of the Chinese army was the infantry, divided into five sections; those armed with guns, swords, archers with [[fire arrow]]s, archers with ordinary arrows and spearmen, backed up by the cavalry and artillery.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The basic weapons for the Chinese infantry were the crossbow and the arquebus, while the cavalry were usually mounted archers.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Chinese infantry wore conical iron helmets and suits of armor made from leather or iron.<ref name=\"auto7\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 20.</ref> According to Turnbull (2008), \"Chinese field artillery and siege cannon were the finest in the region\".<ref name=\"auto7\"/> Chinese artillery was made from cast iron, and were divided into several types, the most important were the \"great general gun\" and the ''folang zhi'' (\"Frankish gun\"), the latter being a breech loaded artillery guns copied from the \"Franks\" (i.e. Europeans).<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The Chinese commander was [[Li Rusong]], a man who has been traditionally disparaged in Japanese accounts; in Turnbull estimate, he was \"in fact, one of Ming China's most accomplished generals\".<ref name=\"auto8\">Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592\u201398'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 17.</ref> Although Li was defeated at the battle of P'y\u01d2kjeyek, his defeat was temporary.

A uniquely Korean weapon was the [[flail (weapon)|flail]], a {{convert|1.5|m}}-long hardwood stick, painted red, acting as the handle for a chain attached to a shaft with iron nails.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> Joseon infantrymen often fought as archers, and a Japanese source from 1592 commented Koreans were superior as soldiers to the Japanese only as archers because their bows had a range of {{convert|450|m}} against the {{convert|300|m}} of Japanese archers.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\nThe standard Korean gun was the [[chongtong|seungja]] \"victory gun\", a handheld shotgun-like cannon attached to a staff.

With the transmission of [[gunpowder]] and [[firearm|firearms technology]] from China during Goryeo, Korea improved upon the original Chinese firearm designs, the [[thunder crash bomb]], and developed advanced cannon which were used with great efficiency at sea. Even though China was the main source of new military technologies in Asia, Korea was a manufacturing base for both cannon and shipbuilding during this era.<ref name=\"SWOPE32\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;32.</ref>\n\nJapan, on the other hand, had been in a [[Sengoku period|state of civil war]] for over a century, which had the result of turning Japan into a very proficient warlike society. When traders from the [[Portuguese Empire]] arrived in Japan and introduced [[arquebus]]es and [[musket]]s, the Japanese warlords were quick to adapt to this [[disruptive innovation]], producing ''en masse'' the [[Tanegashima (gun)|Tanegashima matchlock]]. In the ongoing civil strife, the Japanese refined the [[military parade|drills]] and tactics to make best use of the new weapon, thus giving them a great advantage over the Korean armies.\n\nKorean cannon were not adapted for effective use on land, and firearms were of a less advanced design. The [[small arms]] carried by Japanese soldiers proved to be particularly effective during land engagements and sieges.<ref>Samurai Invasions of Korea, 1592\u20131598, Stephen Turnbull, p. 23</ref> This strategic difference in weapons development and implementation contributed to the trend during the war of Japanese dominance on land and Korean dominance at sea.\n\nAs Japan had been at war since the mid-15th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had half a million battle-hardened soldiers at his disposal<ref name=\"barry3\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;3</ref> to form a remarkable professional army in Asia for the invasion of Korea.<ref name=\"turnbull22\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;22.</ref> While Japan's chaotic state had left the Koreans with a very low estimate of Japan as a military threat,<ref name=\"turnbull22\" /> there was a new sense of unity among the different political factions in Japan, as indicated by the \"[[sword hunt]]\" in 1588 (the confiscation of all weapons from the peasants).<ref name=\"turnbull187\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;187.</ref> Along with the hunt came \"The Separation Edict\" in 1591, which effectively put an end to all Japanese ''wokou'' piracy by prohibiting the daimy\u014ds from supporting the pirates within their fiefs.<ref name=\"turnbull187\" /> Ironically, the Koreans believed that Hideyoshi's invasion would be just an extension of the previous pirate raids that had been repelled before.<ref name=\"turnbull26\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;26.</ref> As for the military situation in Joseon, the Korean scholar official Ryu Seong-ryong observed, \"not one in a hundred [Korean generals] knew the methods of drilling soldiers\":<ref name=\"turnbull15\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> rising in rank depended far more on social connections than military knowledge.<ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen 2002, pp. 16\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Korean soldiers were disorganized, ill-trained, and ill-equipped,<ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen 2002, pp. 16\" /> and they had been used mostly in construction projects such as building castle walls.<ref name=\"tiger12JIMWTC\">{{Cite web\n |last        = Caraway\n |first       = Bill\n |title       = Ch 12 \u2013 Japanese invasions: More Worlds to Conquer\n |work        = Korea in the Eye of the Tiger\n |publisher   = Korea History Project\n |url         = http://koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1202.htm\n |accessdate  = 2007-07-04\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917183025/http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1202.htm\n |archivedate = 2008-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\n====Problems with Joseon defense policies====\n[[File:Chinese Fire Lance with Pellets.JPG|thumb|upright|An illustration of an [[ampulliform]] Chinese fire-lance with a gunpowder charge shooting a blast of flame with lead pellets as coviative projectiles. The weapon was called the 'phalanx-charging fire-gourd'.]]\n\nThere were several defects with the organization of the Joseon-era Korean military defense system.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, pp.&nbsp;17\u201318.</ref> One example was a policy that stated that local officers could not individually respond to a foreign invasion outside of their jurisdiction until a higher ranking general, appointed by the King's court, arrived with a newly mobilized army.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\" /> This arrangement was highly inefficient since the nearby forces would remain stationary until the mobile border commander arrived on the scene and took control.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\" /> Secondly, as the appointed general often came from an outside region, he was likely to be unfamiliar with the natural environment, the available technology, and manpower of the invaded region.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\" /> Finally, as a main army was never maintained, new and ill-trained recruits conscripted during war constituted a significant part of the army.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\" />\n\nThe Korean court managed to carry out some reforms, but they remained problematic. For example, the military training center established in 1589 in [[Gyeongsang Province]] recruited mostly men either too young or too old to be good soldiers, augmented by some adventure-seeking aristocrats and slaves buying their freedom, because able-bodied men of the right age, targeted by the policy, had higher priorities such as farming and other economic activities.<ref name=\"turnbull17-18\"/>\n\nThe dominant form of the Korean fortresses was the ''sanseong'' (\"mountain fortress\"),<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> which consisted of a stone wall that continued around a mountain in a serpentine fashion.<ref name=\"turnbull22\" /> These walls were poorly designed with little use of towers and [[enfilade and defilade|cross-fire]] positions (usually seen in European fortifications), and were mostly low in height.<ref name=\"turnbull22\" /> It was a wartime policy for these fortresses to serve as [[refuge castle]]s and for everyone to evacuate to one, with those who failed to do so being assumed to be collaborators with the enemy; however, the policy never held any great effect because the fortresses were out of reach for most refugees.<ref name=\"turnbull22\" />\n\n====Troop strength====\nHideyoshi mobilized his army at Nagoya Castle a castle located in the old Hizen Province on [[Kyushu]], newly built for the sole purpose of housing the invasion forces and the reserves. None of the original structures remain, but the castle's ruined foundations survive in the formerly separate town of Chinzei, now part of the city of Karatsu in Saga Prefecture.<ref name=\"turnbull40\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;40.</ref> The first invasion consisted of nine divisions totaling 158,800 men, of which the last two of 21,500 were stationed as reserves on [[Tsushima Island]] and [[Iki Island]], respectively.<ref name=\"turnbull42\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;42.</ref> The Japanese used a total of 320,000 troops throughout the entire war.<ref name=\"barry3\" />\n\nOn the other side, Joseon maintained only a few military units with no field army, and its defense depended heavily on the mobilization of the citizen soldiers in case of emergency.<ref name=\"tiger12JIMWTC\" /> During the first invasion, Joseon deployed a total of 84,500 regular troops throughout, assisted by 22,000 [[Irregular military|irregular volunteers]].<ref name=\"turnbull109\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;109.</ref> Ming troops never numbered more than 60,000 troops in Korea at any point of the war.<ref name=\"SWOPE186\" />\n\n====Weapons====\n[[File:Joseoncannon1.JPG|thumb|Joseon cannons such as this one were extensively used by the Joseon navy]]\n[[File:Hwacha2.jpg|thumb|[[Hwacha]], Joseon's multiple rocket-powered arrow launcher]]\n[[File:Joseon era cannon arrow.jpg|thumb|Large iron-tipped wooden missile fired from [[Korean cannon]]s]]\n\nSince its introduction by the Portuguese traders on the island of [[Tanegashima]] in 1543,<ref name=\"hawley3-7\">Hawley, Samuel. pp.&nbsp;3\u20137.</ref> the arquebus had become widely used in Japan.<ref name=\"hawley6\">Hawley, Samuel. p.&nbsp;6.</ref> While both Korea and China had also been introduced to firearms similar to the Portuguese arquebus, most were older models. The Korean soldiers' small arms were [[hand cannons]] with a simple mechanism and with either a gunstock or wooden shaft attached. After the Japanese diplomats presented the Korean court arquebuses as gifts, the Korean scholar-official Ryu Seong-ryong advocated the use of the new weapon, but the Korean court failed to realize its potency.<ref name=\"turnbull36\" /> In contrast, the Japanese often deployed the arquebus in combination with archery in war.<ref name=\"SWOPE30\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;30.</ref>\n\nDuring siege actions, Chinese deployed [[rattan shield]]s and [[Pavise|iron pavises]] (large shields), reputed to be musket-proof.  The Chinese used a variety of weapons, including the [[Chinese archery|Chinese long bow]],<ref name=\"SWOPE29\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;29.</ref> swords,<ref name=\"SWOPE37\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;37.</ref><ref name=\"SWOPE38\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;38.</ref> firearms, early kinds of [[land mine]]s, and early [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"SWOPE26\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;26.</ref>\n\nThe Koreans also demonstrated massive use of ''[[hwacha]]'' \u2013 multiple rocket-propelled arrows, notably during the Siege of Pyongyang in January 1593. It had the ability to fire up to 200 ''singijeon'', a type of rocket arrow, all at one time. The ''hwacha'' consisted of a two-wheeled cart carrying a board filled with holes into which the ''singijeon'' were inserted.  Although the Chinese had their own rocket arrows, the Chinese opted for hand-carried ''[[hu dun pao]]'', or \"crouching tiger cannons\".\n\nThe Japanese defeated successive Korean armies with a combination of muskets, spears, and swords. While muskets used by the Japanese were superior to Korean bows in terms of penetration and range<ref>Andrade, Tonio. (2016) ''The Gunpowder Age'' p. 184: \"When [our] soldiers are lined up against the enemy ranks, our arrows do not reach the enemy while their musket balls rain down upon us.\"</ref> the former lacked the fire rate of the latter. Numerous battle accounts from the Annal of Joseon dynasty and various essays, diaries of Korean officials and commanders show that musket alone could not ensure victory. By employing both musket and ''arme blanche'' (\"cold steel\", swords, lances, spears, and the like), the Japanese were able to achieve success during the early phase of war. Indeed, the ferocious charge of Japanese troops with spears and swords were often more decisive than with muskets. This was because the Koreans were poorly trained in close combat, and lacked battlefield experience and discipline. Thus Korean soldiers were unable to hold their line against charging Japanese soldiers. The following words from a Korean military official named Shi-eon Lee to the Korean king discusses this weakness:\n<blockquote>The King asked him [Shi-eon Lee], \"You have already told me about the low accuracy of Japanese muskets. Why, then, are Korean armies having great problem with defeating them?\"\n<br />\n[Shi-eon Lee] then answered,\n\"The Korean soldiers cower before the enemy and flee for their lives even before they have engaged the enemy. As for the commanders, they seldom leave their positions because they fear that they might be executed for deserting. However, there is a limit to executing deserting soldiers since there are so many of them. Truly, the Japanese aren't good musketeers, but they advance so rapidly that they appear right in front of the Koreans in the time Koreans can shoot only two arrows. It is said that Koreans are good archers, but they seldom hit the targets when the enemy is too far away, and are too scared to shoot when the enemy is near because they fear Japanese swords. Archery often becomes useless because Koreans, fearing the Japanese arme blanche, can barely shoot. The Japanese are reputed to be good swordsmen, but it is possible for Koreans to draw swords and hold their ground. However, the Koreans seldom do this and merely run for their lives.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = The annual records of the Joseon Dynasty\n| volume= 188 (\u5ba3\u7956 38\u5e74 6\u6708 7\u65e5 / June 5, 1605)\n| url = http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.jsp\n| accessdate = 2013-08-29\n| quote = \"\u4e0a\u66f0: \"\u8207\u6211\u570b\u4eba\u4f55\u5982? \u6216\u66f0: \u2018\u502d\u4e0d\u80fd\u99ac\u6230\u2019 \u4e91, \u7136\u8036?\" \u6642\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u99ac\u6230\u4ea6\u975e\u6975\u96e3\u4e4b\u4e8b\u3002 \u502d\u8cca\u521d\u5247\u4e0d\u80fd, \u7d42\u4ea6\u80fd\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\" \u4e0a\u66f0: \"\u502d\u8cca\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c04, \u800c\u4eba\u83ab\u6562\u6575, \u4f55?\" \u6642\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u6211\u570b\u4eba\u898b\u8cca, \u5247\u5148\u6f70\u4ee5\u8d70\u7232\u80fd\u4e8b\u3002 \u5c07\u5247\u96d6\u4e0d\u5fe0, \u754f\u6709\u8ecd\u5f8b, \u4e0d\u6562\u5148\u8d70\u3002 \u8ecd\u4e4b\u8d70\u8005, \u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u8a85, \u60df\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u8a85, \u662f\u4ee5\u8d70\u8033\u3002 \u502d\u8cca\u96d6\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c04, \u5169\u77e2\u4e4b\u9593, \u5ffd\u7109\u5230\u524d, \u6211\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba\u96d6\u66f0\u5584\u5c04, \u9060\u5247\u4e0d\u4e2d, \u8fd1\u5247\u502d\u528d\u53ef\u754f\u3002 \u767c\u77e2\u4e4b\u5f8c, \u6050\u5176\u77ed\u5175\u4f86\u63a5, \u672a\u5f97\u767c\u77e2, \u5c04\u4ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u6043\u77e3\u3002 \u502d\u96d6\u5584\u7528\u528d, \u6211\u570b\u4eba\u82e5\u6301\u528d\u800c\u9032, \u5247\u53ef\u4ee5\u6575\u77e3\u3002 \u6211\u570b\u4eba\u5247\u4e0d\u80fd\u5982\u6b64, \u7686\u4ee5\u8d70\u7232\u5584\u7b56, \u8d70\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ca, \u5247\u7232\u8cca\u6240\u6bba\u3002 \u8cca\u898b\u6211\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba, \u6216\u8d70\u6216\u6b7b, \u6a02\u7232\u4e4b\u8d74\u6230\u3002 \u662f\u4ee5, \u502d\u4e4b\u6c23\u589e\u9577; \u6211\u4e4b\u6c23\u6cae\u55aa\u77e3\u3002\"}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe Koreans seldom employed field artillery, with cannon being mainly used in siege action and for defending castles.

One of the notable Chinese field guns was the \"Great General Cannon\", a large breech-loading cannon with a two-wheeled cart, shooting an iron ball weighing about 10 kilograms. The Japanese employed field artillery only where strategically advantageous in both siege and field warfare situations, often using captured pieces where available.\n\nThe Koreans actively deployed their cavalry divisions in action. But the terrain was often mountainous, which was not generally suitable for cavalry, the farmland tended to have many ditches, and it was often barren and lacked grass essential for feeding the horses. In addition, Japanese use of the arquebus at long range and in concentrated volleys negated any possibility of effective cavalry tactics.<ref name=\"SWOPE38\" /> Korean cavalrymen's primary weapons were bows, with swords and lances holding only subsidiary positions. Most of cavalry action for the Koreans took place in the [[Battle of Chungju]] at the beginning of the war, where they were outnumbered and wiped out by Japanese infantry.<ref name=\"SWOPE28\">Swope. 2005. p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Although the Japanese divisions also fielded cavalry they usually dismounted when engaged in action, acting more as [[mounted infantry]].

Because of advanced artillery and shipbuilding technology, along with an extensive naval history against Japanese pirates, the Korean navies fielded highly advanced and formidable ships. By the time of the Japanese invasion, Korea employed the ''[[panokseon]]'', a powerful galley-type ship armed with cannon that outranged most Japanese vessels. The Korean Navy used this naval superiority to disrupt the Japanese logistical network off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. This advantage, however, did not affect Japan's ability to continuously reinforce its armies through the supply route from Tsushima in Japan to [[Busan]] in Korea, especially once Korean naval bases in the immediate area were neutralized by Japanese ground forces. The Korean navy led by [[Yi Sun-sin]] would withdraw and re-base in the northern border of [[Jeolla Province]]. While not able to entirely prevent reinforcement, the Korean navy continued to harass and inflict losses on the Japanese supply fleets throughout the duration of the war.\n\nAs virtually all Japanese ships in the first phase of the war lacked cannon artillery,<ref name=\"SWOPE32\" /> Korean ships outranged and bombarded Japanese ships with impunity outside the range of the Japanese muskets, arrows, and catapults.<ref name=\"SWOPE32\" /> When the Japanese attempted to outfit cannon to their ships,<ref name=\"Brown252\">Brown, Delmer M., p.&nbsp;252</ref> their lightweight ship design prohibited using more than a few per vessel, and vessels usually lacked the firepower or range of their Korean counterparts.<ref name=\"barry9\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;9</ref> In order to bolster their fleet, the Japanese considered employing two Portuguese galleons in the invasion.<ref name=\"Brown243\">Brown, Delmer M., p.&nbsp;243</ref>\n\nIn addition to a lack of effective naval armament, most Japanese ships were modified merchant vessels more suited for transportation of troops and equipment than fielding artillery weapons.<ref name=\"SWOPE32\" /><ref name=\"barry10\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;10</ref>\n\n====Ongoing Bozhou Miao rebellion in China====\nThe [[Bozhou rebellion]] by the [[Chiefdom of Bozhou]] which lasted from (1589\u20131600) was going on in Bozhou ([[Zunyi]], [[Guizhou]]) in southwestern China at the same time as the Imjin war in Korea.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swope |first1=Kenneth M. |editor1-last=Aung-Thwin |editor1-first=Michael Arthur |editor2-last=Hall |editor2-first=Kenneth R. |title=New Perspectives on the History and Historiography of Southeast Asia: Continuing Explorations |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1136819649 |pages=122\u2013125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvWrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 |chapter=6 To catch a tiger The Eupression of the Yang Yinglong Miao uprising (1578-1600) as a case study in Ming military and borderlands history}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Xie |first1=Xiaohui |editor1-last=Faure |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Ho |editor2-first=Ts'ui-p'ing |title=Chieftains into Ancestors: Imperial Expansion and Indigenous Society in Southwest China |date=2013 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774823712 |pages=118\u2013120 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNBTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120 |chapter=5 From Woman's Fertility to Masculine Authority: The Story of the White Emperor Heavenly Kings in Western Hunan}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Herman |first1=John E. |title=Amid the Clouds and Mist: China's Colonization of Guizhou, 1200\u20131700 |date=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |isbn=0674025911 |pages=164, 165, 281 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWxwAAAAMAAJ&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEIMjAC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ness |first1=John Philip |title=The Southwestern Frontier During the Ming Dynasty |date=1998 |publisher=University of Minnesota |pages=139, 140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI9U6sj_NWMC&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEINTAD}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The country of streams and grottoes |date=1987 |isbn=0674175433 |pages=126, 132, 133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqFQAQAAIAAJ&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEIOjAE}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Swope |first1=Kenneth |title=The Three Great Campaigns of the Wanli Emperor, 1592\u20131600: court, military and society in late sixteenth-century China |date=2001 |publisher=University of Michigan |pages=387, 411, 442 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7wfAQAAMAAJ&q=bozhou+yang&dq=bozhou+yang&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ie6nusviAhUEm-AKHUpeCn8Q6AEIPjAF}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Liew |editor1-first=Foon Ming |title=The Treatises on Military Affairs of the Ming Dynastic History (1368\u20131644): An Annotated Translation of the Treatises on Military Affairs, Chapter 89 and Chapter 90 : Supplemented by the Treatises on Military Affairs of the Draft of the Ming Dynastic History : a Documentation of Ming ..., Part 1 |date=1998 |publisher=Ges.f.

However, the offer was refused by both countries, particularly Joseon, saying that it would be disgraceful to accept assistance from the \"Barbarians\" to the north.\n\nThe Second Division continued east, capturing the fortresses of [[Jongseong]], [[Onsong County]], [[Kyongwon County]], and [[Kyonghung County]], and finally arrived at [[Sosupo]] on the estuary of the [[Tumen River]].<ref name=\"turnbull79-80\" /> There the Japanese rested on the beach, and watched a nearby volcanic island on the horizon that they mistook as [[Mount Fuji]].<ref name=\"turnbull79-80\" /> After the tour, the Japanese continued their previous efforts to bureaucratize and administrate the province, and allowed several garrisons to be handled by the Koreans themselves.<ref name=\"turnbull81-82\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;81\u201382.</ref>\n\n===Naval Campaigns of 1592===\n{{Main|Joseon naval campaigns of 1592}}\n[[File:Admiral Yi Sunshin's Naval campaigns in 1592.svg|400px|thumb|Map of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin's Naval Campaigns \u2013 1592]]\n\nHaving secured Pyeongyang, the Japanese planned to cross the [[Yalu River]] into Jurchen territory, and use the waters west of the Korean peninsula to supply the invasion.<ref name=\"turnbull82\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;82.</ref> However, [[Yi Sun-sin]], who held the post of the Left Naval Commander<ref group=\"n\" name=\"LeftRightNavy01\"/> of the [[Jeolla Province]] (which covers the western waters of Korea), successfully destroyed the Japanese ships transporting troops and supplies.<ref name=\"turnbull82\" /> Japan, lacking enough arms and troops to carry on the invasion of China, changed the objective of the war to the occupation of Korea.<ref name=\"turnbull82\" />\n\nWhen the Japanese troops landed at the port of Busan, Bak (also spelled [[Park (Korean name)|Park]]) Hong, the Left Naval Commander of the Gyeongsang Province, destroyed his entire fleet, his base, and all armaments and provisions, and fled.<ref name=\"turnbull83-4\" /> [[Won Gyun]], the Right Naval Commander, also destroyed and abandoned his own base, and fled to Konyang with only four ships.<ref name=\"turnbull83-4\" /> Thus there was no Korean naval activity around the Gyeongsang Province, and the surviving two, out of the four total fleets, were active only on the other (west) side of the peninsula.<ref name=\"turnbull83-4\" /> Won Gyun later sent a message to Yi Sun-sin that he had fled to Konyang after being overwhelmed by the Japanese in a fight.<ref name=\"turnbull85-6\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, pp.&nbsp;85\u20136.</ref> A messenger was sent by Yi Sun-sin to the nearby island of [[Namhaedo|Namhae]] to give Yi's order for war preparations, only to find it pillaged and abandoned by its own inhabitants.<ref name=\"turnbull85-6\" /> As soldiers began to flee secretly, Yi Sun-sin gave an order \"to arrest the escapees\" and had two of the fugitives brought back and beheaded; he then had their heads put out for display.<ref name=\"turnbull85-6\" /> Yi Sun-sin's battles steadily affected the war and put significant strain on the sea lanes along the western Korean Peninsula supporting the Japanese advance.<ref name=\"turnbull90-1\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, pp.&nbsp;90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe Korean navy relied on a network of local fishermen and scouting boats to receive intelligence of the enemy movements.<ref name=\"turnbull90-1\" /> On the dawn of July 21, 1592, Yi Sun-sin and [[Yi Eok-gi]] set sail with 24 [[panokseon]]s, 15 small warships, and 46 boats (i.e. fishing boats), and arrived at the waters of [[Gyeongsang Province]] by sunset.<ref name=\"turnbull90-1\" /> The Japanese had been sailing up and down the Korean coast, looting and burning all of the sea-side villages, and did not expect opposition from the Korean navy.<ref name=\"Turnbull, 2008 page 31\">Turnbull, 2008 page 31.</ref>\n\n[[File:Turtle boat.jpg|upright|right|thumb|A turtle ship [[replica]] at the [[War Memorial (Seoul)|War Memorial]] in Seoul.

Because it is in the shape of a turtle, our men can look out from inside, but the enemy cannot look in from outside. It moves so swiftly that it can plunge into the midst of even many hundreds of enemy vessel in any weather to attack them with cannonballs and fire throwers\".<ref name=\"Turnbull, 2008 page 33\"/> The Japanese followed their code of ''Bushido'' by fighting ferociously, but the superior firepower and armor of the turtle ships more than compensated.<ref name=\"Turnbull page 33\">Turnbull, 2008 page 33</ref> Admiral Yi commanded from his deck, and was badly wounded when a Japanese sniper put a bullet into his shoulder.<ref name=\"Turnbull page 33\"/>\n\nAt the Battle of Tanpo'o, fought by Miruk island, 21 Japanese ships commanded by Kurushima Michiyuki were in the process of sacking a Korean sea-side village, when the Korean fleet appeared to offer a challenge.<ref>Turnbull, 2008 page 33-34.</ref> Yi once followed his usual tactic of coming forward to challenge, then making a feigned retreat with the Japanese in hot pursuit before ambushing them on the open sea.<ref name=\"Turnbull, 2008 page 34\">Turnbull, 2008 page 34.</ref> A Korean girl who had taken prisoner and forced to become Kurushima's mistress in an interview after the battle said: \"On the day of the battle, arrows and bullets rained on the pavilion vessel where he [Kurushima] sat.

The feigned retreat worked with the Japanese following the Koreans to the open sea, and Yi wrote: <blockquote>Then our ships suddenly enveloped the enemy craft from the four directions, attacking them from both flanks at full speed. The turtle with the Flying Squadron Chief on board rammed the enemy's pavilion vessel once again, while wrecking it with cannon fire, and our other ships hit its brocade curtains and sails with fire arrows.

Kwon Yul quickly advanced northwards, re-taking Suwon and then swung north toward Haengju where he would wait for Chinese reinforcements.

The battle is celebrated today as one of the three most decisive Korean victories (the other two being the [[Siege of Jinju (1592)]] and the [[Battle of Hansando]]).

The Japanese lacked sufficient supplies to move north, and the defeat at Pyongyang had caused part of the Japanese leadership such as [[Konishi Yukinaga]] and [[Ishida Mitsunari]] to seriously consider negotiating with the Ming dynasty forces. This got them into a heated debate with other hawkish generals such as [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]], and these conflicts would eventually have further implications following the war in Japan when the two sides became rivals in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]].\n\nThe Ming forces had their own set of problems. Soon after arriving in Korea the Ming officials began to note the inadequate logistical supply from the Korean court. The records by [[Qian Shizhen]] noted that even after the siege of Pyongyang the Ming forces were already stalled for nearly a week due to the lack of supplies, before moving on to [[Kaesong]].<ref>Statements in \"The records of the Eastern Expedition\" by [[Qian Shizhen]]</ref> As the time went on the situation only become more serious.

Even though the court had assigned the majority of the men on hand to tackle the situation, their desire to reclaim their country, along with the militarily inexperienced nature of many of their administrators, resulted in their continual requests to the Ming forces to advance despite the situation. These events created an increasing level of distrust between the two sides.\n\nThough by mid April 1593, faced with ever-greater logistical pressure from a Korean naval blockade of Yi Sun-sin in addition to a Ming force special operation that managed to burn down a very significant portion of the Japanese grain storage,<ref>[http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E6%98%8E%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7238#.E5.AD.90_.E5.A6.82.E6.9D.BE The history of Ming chapter 238] \u805e\u502d\u5c07\u5e73\u79c0\u5609\u64da\u9f8d\u5c71\u5009\uff0c\u7a4d\u7c9f\u6578\u5341\u842c\uff0c\u5bc6\u4ee4\u5927\u53d7\u7387\u6b7b\u58eb\u5f9e\u9593\u711a\u4e4b\u3002\u502d\u9042\u4e4f\u98df\u3002</ref> the Japanese broke off talks and pulled out of Hanseong.\n\n===Second Siege of Jinju===\n{{Main|Siege of Jinju (1593)}}\n\nUnlike the First Siege of Jinju, the second siege resulted in a Japanese victory.

The soldiers inside the tortoise wagons were also burned and retreated\".<ref name=\"auto28\"/> On 27 July the Japanese again attacked with the \"tortoise shell wagons\", but this time, there was a heavy thunderstorm that prevented Korean attempts to incinerate the Japanese by dropping torches soaked in fat.<ref name=\"auto30\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.71</ref> The Japanese sappers broke down a section of the wall and a great rush broke out with the samurai pushed each other down as it was a great honor to be the first samurai to enter a fortress.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> Goto Mototsgu, a retainer of Kuroda was about to be the first samurai to enter Jinju when Iida Kakbei, a retainer of Kato's, threw the Nichiren flag into the breach to claim that honor for himself.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> The Korean garrison was out of ammunition and were short of swords, so many Koreans fought with wooden sticks against the onrush of samurai armed with ''katanas''.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> One Korean, General S\u014f Yewon engaged in a lengthy single combat with a samurai named Okamoto Gonjo, which ended when the wounded General S\u014f lost his breath and fell down by a tree, and Okamoto took the chance to sever his head with a single blow from his ''katana''.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> S\u014f's head fell down by the Nam river, which as it was a great honor for a samurai to take the head of their enemies, led Okamoto to order a search to find S\u014f's head, so that it could be salted and taken back to Japan.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> The Korean commander, General Kim, committed suicide.<ref name=\"auto30\"/>\n\nAs usual, the Japanese took no prisoners, killing almost everyone both military and civilian, and the Nam river ran red with blood as thousands attempted to swim across the Nam, only to be cut down by the samurai waiting on the other side.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> The chronicler of the Kato family noted: \"All the Chinese were terrified of our Japanese blades, and jumped into the river, but we pulled them and cut off their heads\".<ref name=\"auto30\"/> Korean accounts mention that almost all of the 60,000 soldiers in Jinju were killed while Japanese accounts mention the samurai sent 20,000 heads back to Japan after their victory.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> Only the ''kisaneng'' (courtesans) of Jinju were spared as they pressed to service the victorious Japanese generals at a party they held to celebrate their victory on the evening of the same day at the Ch'oks\u014fngu Pavilion on a nearby hill as it offered the best view of the \"hellish scene\" below them.<ref name=\"auto30\"/> One courtesan, Nongae, attracted the attention of a samurai, Keyamura Rokunosuke, whom she lured to a cliff by promising him sex, and then threw both herself and him off the cliff, becoming a national heroine in Korea.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.71 & 74</ref> Jinju was taken only for symbolic purposes, and instead of advancing, the Japanese force at Jinju retreated back to Busan as there was a larger Chinese force to the north.<ref name=\"auto31\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p. 74</ref> Hideyoshi was well satisfied that he had avenged the defeat of 1592 at Jinju, through Turnbull argued that to lose so many men to take a town only for symbolic reasons was wasteful.<ref name=\"auto31\"/>\n\n==Negotiations and truce between China and Japan (1594\u20131596)==\n[[File:Ming army2.JPG|thumb|Painting of the Ming Army camped in [[Ningxia]]]]\n\nThere were two factors that triggered the Japanese to withdraw: first, a Chinese commando penetrated Hanseong (present-day Seoul) and burned storehouses at Yongsan, destroying most of what was left of the Japanese troops' depleted stock of food. Secondly, Shen Weijing made another appearance to conduct negotiations, and threatened the Japanese with an attack by 400,000 Chinese. The Japanese under Konishi and Kato, aware of their weak situation, agreed to withdraw to the Pusan area while the Chinese would withdraw back to China. A ceasefire was imposed, and a Ming emissary was sent to Japan to discuss peace terms.<ref>Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 4, Early Modern Japan, p. 281.</ref> For the next three years, there was little fighting as the Japanese retained control of a few coastal fortresses with the rest of Korea being controlled by the Koreans.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.75</ref>\n\nBy May 18, 1594, all the Japanese soldiers had retreated to the area around Busan and many began to make their way back to Japan. The Ming government withdrew most of its expeditionary force, but kept 16,000 men on the Korean peninsula to guard the truce.\n\nOnce peace negotiations between China and Japan finally got underway, Chinese negotiators gave the Ming Emperor the mistaken impression that he was about to deal with a minor state that had been subdued by war. Furthermore, they conveyed the idea that the Japanese regent, Hideyoshi, was prepared to become his vassal. Under such conditions, the Chinese sought to resolve the issue in their favor by including Japan in their tributary system of foreign relations. They would establish Hideyoshi as king of Japan and grant him the privilege of formal tribute trade relations with the Ming dynasty.\n\nIn Japan, Hideyoshi's negotiators apparently led him to believe that China was suing for peace and was ready to accept him as their emperor. Thus, Hideyoshi issued the demands of a victor; first, a daughter of the Ming emperor must be sent to become the wife of the Japanese emperor; second, the southern provinces of Joseon must be ceded to Japan; third, normal trade relations between China and Japan must be restored; and fourth, a Joseon prince and several high-ranking government officials must be sent to Japan as hostages.\n\nBargaining from such fundamentally different perspectives, there was no prospect whatsoever for success in the talks. Early in 1597, both sides resumed hostilities.<ref name=\"tiger12JITHF\">{{Cite web\n |last=Caraway\n |first=Bill\n |title=Ch 12 \u2013 Japanese invasions: The Home Front\n |work=Korea in the Eye of the Tiger\n |publisher=Korea History Project\n |url=http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1204.htm\n |accessdate=2007-07-04\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403230844/http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C12/E1204.htm\n |archivedate=2009-04-03\n}}</ref>\n\n==Korean military reorganization==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n\n=== Proposal for military reforms ===\nDuring the period between the First and Second invasions, the Korean government had a chance to examine the reasons why they had been easily overrun by the Japanese. Ryu Seong-ryong, the Prime Minister, spoke out about the Korean disadvantages.\n\nRyu pointed out that Korean castle defenses were extremely weak, a fact which he had pointed out before the war. He noted how Korean castles had incomplete fortifications and walls that were too easy to scale. He also wanted cannons set up in the walls. Ryu proposed building strong towers with gun turrets for cannons. Besides castles, Ryu wanted to form a line of defenses in Korea. In this kind of defense, the enemy would have to scale many walls in order to reach Hanseong (Seoul).\n\nRyu also pointed out how efficient the Japanese army was, since it took them only one month to reach Hanseong, and how well organized they were. He noted how the Japanese moved their units in complex maneuvers, often weakening their enemy with the use of arquebuses, then attacking with [[M\u00eal\u00e9e weapon|melee weapons]].\n\n===Military Training Agency===\n[[King Seonjo]] and the Korean court finally began to reform the military. In September 1593, the Military Training Agency (\ud6c8\ub828\ub3c4\uac10, alternately translated as Military Training Command) was established. The agency carefully divided the army into units and companies. Within the companies were squads of archers, arquebusiers, swordsmen, and spear infantry. The agency set up divisional units in each region of Korea and garrisoned battalions at castles. The agency, which originally had less than 80 troops, soon grew to about 10,000.\n\nOne of the most important changes was that both upper class citizens and slaves were subject to the draft. All males had to enter military service be trained and familiarized with weapons.\n\nIt was also around this time that the military scholar [[Han Gyo]] (\ud55c\uad50) wrote the martial arts manual [[Muyejebo]], based on the book [[Jixiao Xinshu]] by the famous Chinese general [[Qi Jiguang]].\n\n==Second invasion (1597\u20131598)==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 30em; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; clear: right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" | Japanese second invasion wave<ref name=\"Sansom 1961, p353\" />\n|-\n| Army of the Right\n|-\n|\n| [[M\u014dri Hidemoto]]\n| 30,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]]\n| 10,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Kuroda Nagamasa]]\n| 5,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Nabeshima Naoshige]]\n| 12,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Ikeda Hideuji]]\n| 2,800\n|-\n|\n| [[Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika]]\n| 3,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Nakagawa Hidenari]]\n| 2,500\n|-\n| Subtotal\n|\n| '''65,300'''\n|-\n| Army of the Left\n|-\n|\n| [[Ukita Hideie]]\n| 10,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Konishi Yukinaga]]\n| 7,000\n|-\n|\n| [[S\u014d Yoshitoshi]]\n| 1,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Matsura Shigenobu]]\n| 3,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Arima Harunobu]]\n| 2,000\n|-\n|\n| [[\u014cmura Yoshiaki]]\n| 1,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Got\u014d Sumiharu]]\n| 700\n|-\n|\n| [[Hachisuka Iemasa]]\n| 7,200\n|-\n|\n| [[M\u014dri Yoshinari]]\n| 2,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Ikoma Kazumasa]]\n| 2,700\n|-\n|\n| [[Shimazu Yoshihiro]]\n| 10,000\n|-\n|\n| [[Shimazu Tadatsune]]\n| 800\n|-\n|\n| [[Akizuki Tanenaga]]\n| 300\n|-\n|\n| [[Takahashi Mototane]]\n| 600\n|-\n|\n| [[It\u014d Suketaka]]\n| 500\n|-\n|\n| [[Sagara Yorifusa]]\n| 800\n|-\n| Subtotal\n|\n| '''49,600'''\n|-\n| Naval Command\n|-\n|\n| [[T\u014dd\u014d Takatora]]\n| 2,800\n|-\n|\n| [[Kat\u014d Yoshiaki]]\n| 2,400\n|-\n|\n| [[Wakisaka Yasuharu]]\n| 1,200\n|-\n|\n| [[Kurushima Michifusa]]\n| 600\n|-\n|\n| [[Mitaira Saemon]]\n| 200\n|-\n| Subtotal\n|\n| '''7,200'''\n|-\n| Total\n|\n| '''122,100'''\n|}\n\nAfter the failed peace negotiations of the inter-war years, Hideyoshi launched the second invasion of Korea. One of the main strategic differences between the first and second invasions was that conquering China was no longer an explicit goal for the Japanese. Failing to gain a foothold during Kat\u014d Kiyomasa's Chinese campaign and the near complete withdrawal of the Japanese forces during the first invasion had established that the Korean peninsula was the more prudent and realistic objective.\n\nSoon after the Chinese ambassadors had safely returned to China in 1597, Hideyoshi sent approximately 200 ships with an estimated 141,100 men under the overall command of [[Kobayakawa Hideaki]].<ref name=\"turnbull187\" /> Japan's second force arrived unopposed on the southern coast of Gyeongsang Province in 1596.

In the early Autumn of 1597, the Japanese began a more focused and sustained advance. The Japanese planned to attack [[Jeollanam-do|Jeolla Province]] in the southwestern part of the peninsula and eventually occupy [[Jeonju]], the provincial capital. Korean success in the [[Siege of Jinju (1593)|Siege of Jinju]] in 1592 had mostly saved this area from devastation during the first invasion. Two Japanese armies, under [[M\u014dri Hidemoto]] and [[Ukita Hideie]], began the assault in Busan and marched towards Jeonju, taking Sacheon and Changpyong along the way.\n\n====Plot to dismiss Yi Sun-sin====\n[[File:Navalzhugenu2.jpg|thumb|240px|A naval battle.

Government officials gave direct orders to launch a surprise naval operation against the Japanese, based on a tip from a presumed reliable Japanese spy. Yi refused to obey these orders, knowing that this was an obvious trap meant to have his own fleet sail in to an ambush. This development allowed others within the court to further advance their personal agendas while Yi was severely punished. Ultimately, Won Gyun was appointed in Yi Sun-sin's place at the head of the Korean navy.\n\n====Battle of Chilcheollyang====\n{{Main|Battle of Chilcheollyang}}\nAfter Won Gyun replaced Yi Sun-sin as head of the navy, he was quick to take action and justify his newly acquired position. He gathered the entire Korean fleet, which now had more than 100 ships outside of Yosu, to search for the Japanese. Without any previous preparations or planning, Won Gyun then had his entire fleet sail towards Busan.\n\nAfter one day at sea, Won Gyun was informed of a large Japanese fleet near Busan. He decided to attack immediately, despite reports of exhaustion among the crew of the ship.\n\nAt the subsequent [[Battle of Chilcheollyang]], Won Gyun was completely outmaneuvered by the Japanese in a surprise attack. His ships were overwhelmed by arquebus fire and the traditional Japanese boarding attacks, which largely resulted in the destruction of his entire fleet. But the defection before the battle of Bae Soel, an officer who did not submit to Won Gyun's leadership, kept thirteen panokseons out of the battle. These would form the entire fighting force of the Korean Navy during the immediately following months.\n\nThe Battle of Chilcheollyang was one of Japan's most decisive naval victories of the war. Won Gyun was himself killed by a Japanese garrison after he struggled ashore on an island after the destruction of his flagship. The victory allowed the Japanese navy to safely escort its troop ships and to support planned landing operations.<ref>National Library of Australian Cataloguing-in-Publication entry, Japanese Sea Power: A Maritime Nation\u2019s Struggle for Identity, Sajima, N (Naoko), 1959\u2013.

The garrison of [[Namwon]] became their next key target.\n\nNamwon was located fifty kilometres southeast of Jeonju. Correctly predicting a Japanese attack, a coalition force of 6,000 soldiers (including 3,000 Chinese troops under [[Yang Yuan]] and civilian volunteers) were prepared to fight the approaching Japanese forces.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;191.</ref> The Japanese laid siege to the walls of the fortress with ladders and siege towers.<ref>\u8107\u5742\u7d00, \u592a\u7530 \u85e4\u56db\u90ce and \u5859 \u4fdd\u5df1\u4e00, editors, \u7d9a\u7fa4\u66f8\u985e\u5f93 [Zoku Gunsho Ruiju Series], 1933, p.&nbsp;448.</ref> The two sides exchanged volleys with arquebuses and bows.

When [[Kat\u014d Kiyomasa]] laid siege to the mountain with the Army of the Right, which he attacked at night under the full moon, the Koreans lost morale and retreated with 350 casualties.<ref name=\"Turnbull, Stephen page 82\"/> The successful siege did not, however, lead to a subsequent advance from beyond Gyeongsang Province.\n\n====First Korean and Ming counter offensive====\nUpon the start of the second invasion, the Ming emperor was furious about the entire deb\u00e2cle of the peace talks and turned his wrath on many of its chief supporters; particularly [[Shi Xing]], the Minister of War, who was removed from his position and jailed (he died several years later, in prison). The chief negotiator, [[Shen Weijing]], was executed. [[Xing Jie]] was named the new minister of war and [[Yang Hao (Ming dynasty)|Yang Hao]] as the new chief superintendent (Jin Lue) of Korea; Xing Jie himself was also stationed in Korea for the remainder of the war. The Ming leadership quickly pulled in many units stationed near its border with Korea.\n\n====Battle of Jiksan====\n{{Main|Battle of Jiksan}}\n\nAfter the steady Japanese advances on land, they were planned to assault Hanseong (present-day Seoul) by late August or early September 1597. However, the plans were foiled by a Ming defense around Jiksan (modern day [[Cheonan]]).\n\nForces under [[Kuroda Nagamasa]] formed the vanguard of the right army and marched toward Hanseong, which deeply disturbed the court at Hanseong. Several of the Ming generals stationed in Korea suggested to the court that they pull back their forces until they could gather more reinforcements, but the Ming administrators overruled their generals and ordered them to make a stand.

Konishi, Shimazu, Kat\u014d Kiyomasa and other Japanese generals of the Left Army congregated in Pusan and withdrew to Japan on December 21. The last ships sailed to Japan on December 24, bringing an end to seven years of war.\n\n==Postwar negotiations==\nAs Tsushima had suffered greatly from its loss of trade with Korea as a result of the invasions, Yoshitoshi of the S\u014d family, then dominant in Tsushima, undertook the lead in the peace negotiations by Japan. He sent four peace missions to Joseon in 1599 to normalize relations. The first three were captured and sent directly to Beijing by Chinese troops, but the fourth one, in 1601, successfully obtained from the Joseon court the promise of a normalizing of relations upon the return of remaining Joseon captives.<ref name=\"turnbull235\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;235.</ref> As Ming troops continued to be present in Korea following the withdrawal of Japanese forces, the major incentive for Joseon for the normalization of relations with Japan was the withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers from their territory. The Ming Chinese themselves were causing havoc, and their presence continued to strain Joseon's national economy and infrastructure.<ref name=\"turnbull235\" /> In response to the Joseon request, Yoshitoshi promptly released several Joseon prisoners and between 1603 and 1604 helped the Joseon envoys to repatriate a further 3,000 by organizing negotiations at Kyoto with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], by then the Shogun of Japan.<ref name=\"turnbull235\" />\n\nIn the continuation of the diplomatic talks toward peaceful relations, Joseon in 1606 expanded its conditions and demanded that the Shogun write a formal letter requesting peace, and to extradite the Japanese soldiers who had defiled the [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty|Joseon Royal Tombs]] near Hanseong (Seoul).<ref name=\"turnbull235\" /> Realizing that the Shogunate would never agree to such a request, Yoshitoshi sent a forged letter and a group of criminals instead; the great need to expel the Ming soldiers pushed Joseon into accepting and to send an emissary in 1608.<ref name=\"turnbull235\" /> The end result was a return of Joseon prisoners and the restoration of diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.<ref name=\"turnbull236\">Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;236.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and conclusion==\n[[File:Port of Yeosu.jpg|thumb|Yeosu in 2005.

After Hideyoshi's death, his young son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] became head of the [[Toyotomi clan]]. However, the losses suffered by varying ''daimy\u014ds'' during the campaign were a contributing factor to the imbalance of power in Japan after the war. As the western-based daimy\u014d of Kyushu and western Honshu (partially by geographic convenience) contributed the majority of the forces used during the Korean conflict, it left the pro-Hideyoshi alliance weakened for the eventual struggle with the mostly eastern-backed forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu (who himself never sent forces to Korea). Tokugawa would go on to unify Japan and establish himself as Shogun in 1603, following the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]] against a coalition of mostly western-based ''daimy\u014ds''.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. 2002, p.&nbsp;233.</ref>\n\nMing China also sustained a heavy financial burden for its role in defending Korea while also fighting several other conflicts in the same decade. The war also indirectly weakened China's position in Manchuria, which gave the fledgling Manchu chieftain Nurhachi an opportunity to expand his influence and territory. Nurhachi's expansions would culminate in the eventual collapse of the Ming Dynasty and the rise of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644.<ref name=\"barry21\">Strauss, Barry. p.&nbsp;21.</ref> However, the [[sinocentric]] tributary system that the Ming had defended continued to be maintained by the Qing, and ultimately, the war resulted in a maintenance of the status quo \u2013 with the re-establishment of trade and the normalization of relations between all three parties.<ref name=\"SWOPE758-9\">Swope. 2002. pp.&nbsp;758\u201359.</ref>\n\nGiven that the conflict was fought exclusively on Korean soil, Korea ultimately suffered the most damage of the three participants.<ref name=\"barry21\" /> It lost a large portion of its military strength and civilian population, had numerous cultural heritage sites damaged or destroyed, and many of its technological advancements pillaged.<ref name=\"Elisonas\" >Jurgis Elisonas, \"The inseparable trinity:Japan's relations with China and Korea\", in [[John Whitney Hall]] (ed.)
