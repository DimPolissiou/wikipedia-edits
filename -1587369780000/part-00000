Philosophical writings from [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''<ref>\nBenjamin Jowett's translation of Plato's ''Republic'' does not use the word \"leadership\"; Plato discusses primarily a \"[[Philosopher king|guardian]]\" class.

This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the \"[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]\".\n\nA number of works in the 19th century \u2013 when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane \u2013 explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.\n\n[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853\u20131902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with \"moral force of character and instincts to lead\", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help \"render war impossible\". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''\"Instincts to Lead\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Rise of alternative theories===\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;<ref>Bird, C. (1940). ''Social Psychology''. New York: Appleton-Century.</ref> Stogdill, 1948;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stogdill | first1 = R.

In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that people who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.\n\n===Reemergence of trait theory===\n\nNew methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.<ref name=\"Kenny, D.A. 1983\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D.

This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past.

John (Eds.), ''Handbook of personality: Theory and research'' (pp. 219\u2013247). New York: Guilford Press.</ref> In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes.\n\n===Behavioral and style theories===\n{{Main|Managerial grid model}}\n\nIn response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.<ref>[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]</ref> [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)</ref>\n[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]\n\n[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].<ref>[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders. They would then identify if these particular behaviors are reflective of leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions<ref>\"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples\"(2017)</ref> The first dimension was identified as \"Initiating Structure\", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered \"task oriented\" behaviors. The second dimension is \"Consideration\", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered \"social oriented\" behaviors.<ref>AAmodt (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they had similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they also contributed an additional behavior identified in leaders: participative behavior (also called \"servant leadership\"), or allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. This entails avoiding controlling types of leadership and allows more personal interactions between leaders and their subordinates.<ref>Stoker (2016)</ref>\n\nThe managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.<ref>[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]</ref>\n\n====Positive reinforcement====\n[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.</ref> The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.\n\nThe use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.<ref>Lussier, R. N., & Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, & Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.</ref> Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.\n\n===Situational and contingency theories===\n{{Main|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom\u2013Yetton decision model|path\u2013goal theory}}\n\nSituational theory also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.<ref>[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16</ref> This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, \"what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions.\"<ref>[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]</ref>\n\nSome theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the \"hearts and minds\" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not \"take charge\", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.<ref>[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198</ref> Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as [[contingency theory]]. Three contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, and the path-goal theory.\n\nThe [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).<ref>[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]</ref> According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a \"favorable situation\". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.\n\n[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)<ref>[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]</ref> and later with Arthur Jago (1988),<ref>[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]</ref> developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.<ref>[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]</ref> This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.<ref>[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]</ref>\n\nThe [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].<ref>[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]</ref> According to House, the essence of the theory is \"the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance\".<ref>[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]</ref> The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.\n\n===Functional theory===\n{{Main|Functional leadership model}}\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]\nFunctional leadership theory (Hackman & Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes & Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman & Wageman, 2005; Hackman & Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, & Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman & Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.\n\nA variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.\n\n===Integrated psychological theory===\n{{Main|Three Levels of Leadership model}}\n\nThe Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, introducing a new element \u2013 the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].<ref>Businessballs management information website \u2013 Leadership Theories page, \"Integrated Psychological Approach\" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership</ref>\n\nIntegrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).<ref>Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}</ref>\nScouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\nHe pointed out, for example, that:\n* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.\n* An ideal style (e.g. Blake & Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.\n* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.\n* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing \"[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]\"; that certain \"something\" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.\n\nScouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an \"Integrated Psychological\" theory on the Businessballs education website.<ref>Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15</ref> In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.\n\nThe three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:\n* The first two \u2013 public and private leadership \u2013 are \"outer\" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called \"the four dimensions of leadership\". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.\n* The third \u2013 [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] \u2013 is an \"inner\" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people \u2013 which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery \u2013 the foundation for authentic leadership.\n\nScouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137\u2013237.</ref>\n\n===Transactional and transformational theories===\n{{Main|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}\n\n[[Bernard Bass]] and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B.

It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.\n\n===Leader\u2013member exchange theory===\n{{Main|Leader\u2013member exchange theory}}\nThis LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader\u2013member exchange (LMX) theory,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G.

Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16 16\u201317]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16}}</ref> LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17}}</ref>\n\n====In-group members====\n\n[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/> In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.\n\n====Out-group members====\n\n[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/>\n\n===Emotions===\n{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}\nLeadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

[[Group affective tone]] represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group. Group affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual members of the group and refers to mood at the group level of analysis. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have a more positive affective tone than do groups with leaders in a negative mood.<ref name=cote/>\n# Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and [[Task (project management)|task]] [[strategy]]. Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.<ref name=cote/>\nIn research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.<ref name=george>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

The leader creates situations and events that lead to emotional response. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events. Leaders shape workplace affective events. Examples \u2013 feedback giving, allocating tasks, resource distribution.

It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',<ref>[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995</ref> [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''<ref>[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009</ref>).\n\nDifferent situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.<ref name=Lewin>{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R.

The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.<ref>Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). \"Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile\". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).</ref>\n\n===Autocratic or authoritarian===\n\nUnder the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.\n\nAutocratic leaders do not ask or entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.<ref name=Lewin/>\n\n===Participative or democratic===\nThe democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].\n\n=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===\nIn Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===\n{{Main|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}\nTask-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.\n\nRelationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135\u2013136|edition=8th}}</ref> Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.\n\nTask-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. These leaders have  absolute focus on the goal and the tasks cut out for each member. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer\n\n===Paternalism===\n{{Main|Paternalism}}\nPaternalism leadership styles often reflect a father-figure mindset. The structure of team is organized hierarchically where the leader is viewed above the followers. The leader also provides both professional and personal direction in the lives of the members.<ref name=\"Aycan\">{{cite book |last1=Aycan |first1=Z |title=Paternalism: Towards conceptual refinement and operationalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |pages=445\u2013446}}</ref> There is often a limitation on the choices that the members can choose from due to the heavy direction given by the leader.\n\nThe term paternalism is from the Latin pater meaning \"father\". The leader is most often a male. This leadership style is often found in Russia, Africa, and Pacific Asian Societies.<ref name=\"Aycan\"/>\n\n==Leadership differences affected by gender==\n{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}\nAnother factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.

These barriers also change according to different cultures. Despite the increasing number of female leaders in the world, only a small fraction come from non-westernized cultures. It is important to note that although the barriers listed below may be more severe in non-western culture, it does not imply that westernized cultures do not have these barriers as well. This aims to compare the differences between the two.\n\n'''Research and Literature'''\nAlthough there have been many studies done on leadership for women in the past decade, very little research has been done for women in paternalistic cultures. The literature and research done for women to emerge into a society that prefers males is lacking.  This ultimately hinders women from knowing how to reach their individual leadership goals, and fails to educate the male counterparts in this disparity.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tsui |author2=Nifadkar |author3=Ou |title=Cross-Cultural Organizational Behavior Research: Advances, Gaps, and Recommendations |journal=Journal of Management |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=426\u2013478 |doi=10.1177/0149206307300818 |year=2007}}</ref>\n\n'''Maternity Leave'''\nStudies have shown the importance of longer  paid maternity leave and the positive effects it has on a female employee's mental health and return to work. In Sweden, it was shown that the increased flexibility in timing for mothers to return to work, decreased the odds of poor mental health reports. In these non-western cultures that mostly follow paternalism, the lack of knowledge on the benefits of maternity leave impact the support given to the women during this important time in their life.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chatrerji |author2=Markowitz |title=Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Maternal Health? |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=2004 |volume=72 |issue=1 |page=16|doi=10.2307/20062092 |jstor=20062092 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10206.pdf }}</ref>\n\n'''Society and Laws'''\nCertain countries that follow paternalism, such as India, still allow for women to be treated unjustly. Child marriage and minor punishments for perpetrators in crime against women, shape the society's view on how females should be treated. This can prevent women from feeling comfortable to speak out in both a personal and professional setting.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Yadav |author2=Singh |title=Gender and Politics of Culture |journal=Political Science |date=2015 |page=77}}</ref>\n\n'''Glass Ceilings and Glass Cliffs'''\nWomen who work in a very paternalistic culture or industry (e.g. oil or engineering industry), often deal with a limitations in their career that prevent them from moving up any further. This association is often due to the mentality that only males carry leadership characteristics. The glass cliff term refers to undesired projects that are often given to women because they have an increase in risk of failure. These undesired projects are given to female employees where they are more likely to fail and leave the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vinkenberg |author2=Engen |author3=Eagly |author4=Johannesen-Schmidt |title=An exploration of stereotypical beliefs about leadership styles: Is transformational leadership a route to womens promotion? |journal=The Leadership Quarterly |date=2011 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=10\u201321|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.12.003 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1313103/LQ_2011_VinkenburgVanEngenEaglyJohannesenSchmidt.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nIn the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day & Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, & Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.\n\nJob performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.\n\n[[File:HierarchyOfLeaderEfficiency.jpg|thumb|Hierarchy Of Leader Efficiency based on Hierarchy of Competence\nand the M5 Work Motivation Model <ref>Igor Kokcharov, Hierarchy of Skills http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015</ref>]]\n\n\"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader\u2019s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader\u2019s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass & Riggio, 2006, p. 47).\"\n<ref>Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed).

Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4 4\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4}}</ref> However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.\n\nDetermination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nSelf-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and [[soft skills|social abilities]] in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nFew great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.\n\n==Ontological-phenomenological model==\nOne of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as \"an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...\". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as \"followers\" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the \"idea of the leader\", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.<ref>Forthcoming in \"The Handbook for Teaching Leadership\", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, & Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682</ref>\n\n==Contexts==\n\n===Organizations===\nAn organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.<ref>{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884\u201389|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life \u2014 the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.\n\nIn prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.<ref name=\"Henry\">{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O.

Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.<ref name=\"Henry\"/>\n\nA leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern & Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader \"as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society.\" Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.<ref>Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.</ref> An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.<ref name=\"Henry\"/> Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}</ref>\n\n===Management===\nOver the years the philosophical terminology of \"[[management]]\" and \"leadership\" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between \"transactional\" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and \"transformational\" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).<ref name=\"Burns\"/>\n\n===Group===\nIn contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P.

Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}</ref>\n\nLeaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups.

Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.\n* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.\n\n'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''\n* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.\n* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.\n* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.\n* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.\n* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.\n* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.\n* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.\n* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.\n* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.\n* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.\n\n===Self-leadership===\n[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.<ref>Hackman, M. & Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.</ref> Self-leadership is having a developed sense of who you are, what you can achieve, what are your goals coupled with the ability to affect your emotions, behaviors and communication. At the center of leadership is the person who is motivated to make the difference. Self-leadership is a way toward more effectively leading other people.  <ref>Browning, M (2018). \"Self-Leadership: Why It Matters\"</ref>\n\n===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===\n[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.<ref>van Vugt, M., & Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.</ref> They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Meij | first1 = L. | last2 = Schaveling | first2 = J. | last3 = van Vugt | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 72\u201379 | doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.06.005 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.<ref>Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books</ref> This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.\n\nBy comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a \"[[hippie]] chimp\".<ref>\n[https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/30/070730fa_fact_parker Swingers - The New Yorker<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n</ref>\n\n==Myths==\nLeadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).<ref>Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.</ref><ref>Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.</ref>\n\n===Leadership is innate===\nAccording to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.<ref name=Forsyth>Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.</ref> Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).\n\n===Leadership is possessing power over others===\nAlthough leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people \u2013 rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).<ref name=Forsyth/> Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).\n\n===Leaders are positively influential===\nThe [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.<ref>Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.</ref>\n\n===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===\nIn [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J.

Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them. Although individuals filling leadership roles can be a direct source of resentment for followers, most people appreciate the contributions that leaders make to their groups and consequently welcome the guidance of a leader (Stewart & Manz, 1995).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = G.

Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 1990s to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32\u201341|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}</ref>\n\n==Critical thought==\n\n[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 \"[[Great Man theory]]\", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to \"great men\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Popper\n| first1 = Karl\n| author-link1 = Karl Popper\n| year = 1945\n| chapter = Preface to the First Edition\n| title = The Open Society and Its Enemies \n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw9wV2Unpe8C\n| edition = 7\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2012\n| page = xxxiii\n| isbn = 9781136749773\n| access-date = 2017-08-20\n| quote = [...] if our civilisation is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.

This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the \"[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]\".\n\nA number of works in the 19th century \u2013 when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane \u2013 explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.\n\n[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853\u20131902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with \"moral force of character and instincts to lead\", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help \"render war impossible\". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''\"Instincts to Lead\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Rise of alternative theories===\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;<ref>Bird, C. (1940). ''Social Psychology''. New York: Appleton-Century.</ref> Stogdill, 1948;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stogdill | first1 = R.

In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that people who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.\n\n===Reemergence of trait theory===\n\nNew methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.<ref name=\"Kenny, D.A. 1983\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D.

This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past.

New York: Guilford Press.</ref> In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes.\n\n===Behavioral and style theories===\n{{Main|Managerial grid model}}\n\nIn response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.<ref>[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]</ref> [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)</ref>\n[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]\n\n[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].<ref>[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders. They would then identify if these particular behaviors are reflective of leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions<ref>\"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples\"(2017)</ref> The first dimension was identified as \"Initiating Structure\", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered \"task oriented\" behaviors. The second dimension is \"Consideration\", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered \"social oriented\" behaviors.<ref>AAmodt (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they had similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they also contributed an additional behavior identified in leaders: participative behavior (also called \"servant leadership\"), or allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. This entails avoiding controlling types of leadership and allows more personal interactions between leaders and their subordinates.<ref>Stoker (2016)</ref>\n\nThe managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.<ref>[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]</ref>\n\n====Positive reinforcement====\n[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.</ref> The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.\n\nThe use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.<ref>Lussier, R. N., & Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, & Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.</ref> Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.\n\n===Situational and contingency theories===\n{{Main|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom\u2013Yetton decision model|path\u2013goal theory}}\n\nSituational theory also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.<ref>[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16</ref> This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, \"what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions.\"<ref>[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]</ref>\n\nSome theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the \"hearts and minds\" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not \"take charge\", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.<ref>[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198</ref> Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as contingency theory. Three contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, and the path-goal theory.\n\nThe [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).<ref>[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]</ref> According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a \"favorable situation\". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.\n\n[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)<ref>[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]</ref> and later with Arthur Jago (1988),<ref>[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]</ref> developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.<ref>[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]</ref> This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.<ref>[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]</ref>\n\nThe [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].<ref>[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]</ref> According to House, the essence of the theory is \"the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance\".<ref>[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]</ref> The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.\n\n===Functional theory===\n{{Main|Functional leadership model}}\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]\nFunctional leadership theory (Hackman & Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes & Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman & Wageman, 2005; Hackman & Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, & Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman & Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.\n\nA variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.\n\n===Integrated psychological theory===\n{{Main|Three Levels of Leadership model}}\n\nThe Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, introducing a new element \u2013 the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].<ref>Businessballs management information website \u2013 Leadership Theories page, \"Integrated Psychological Approach\" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership</ref>\n\nIntegrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).<ref>Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}</ref>\nScouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\nHe pointed out, for example, that:\n* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.\n* An ideal style (e.g. Blake & Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.\n* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.\n* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing \"[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]\"; that certain \"something\" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.\n\nScouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an \"Integrated Psychological\" theory on the Businessballs education website.<ref>Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15</ref> In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.\n\nThe three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:\n* The first two \u2013 public and private leadership \u2013 are \"outer\" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called \"the four dimensions of leadership\". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.\n* The third \u2013 [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] \u2013 is an \"inner\" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people \u2013 which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery \u2013 the foundation for authentic leadership.\n\nScouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137\u2013237.</ref>\n\n===Transactional and transformational theories===\n{{Main|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}\n\n[[Bernard Bass]] and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B.

It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.\n\n===Leader\u2013member exchange theory===\n{{Main|Leader\u2013member exchange theory}}\nThis LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader\u2013member exchange (LMX) theory,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G.

Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16 16\u201317]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16}}</ref> LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17}}</ref>\n\n====In-group members====\n\n[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/> In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.\n\n====Out-group members====\n\n[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/>\n\n===Emotions===\n{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}\nLeadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

[[Group affective tone]] represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group.

Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.<ref name=cote/>\nIn research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.<ref name=george>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

The leader creates situations and events that lead to emotional response. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events.

It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',<ref>[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995</ref> [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''<ref>[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009</ref>).\n\nDifferent situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.<ref name=Lewin>{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R.

The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.<ref>Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). \"Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile\". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).</ref>\n\n===Autocratic or authoritarian===\n\nUnder the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.\n\nAutocratic leaders do not ask or entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.<ref name=Lewin/>\n\n===Participative or democratic===\nThe democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].\n\n=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===\nIn Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===\n{{Main|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}\nTask-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.\n\nRelationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135\u2013136|edition=8th}}</ref> Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.\n\nTask-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. These leaders have  absolute focus on the goal and the tasks cut out for each member. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer\n\n===Paternalism===\n{{Main|Paternalism}}\nPaternalism leadership styles often reflect a father-figure mindset. The structure of team is organized hierarchically where the leader is viewed above the followers. The leader also provides both professional and personal direction in the lives of the members.<ref name=\"Aycan\">{{cite book |last1=Aycan |first1=Z |title=Paternalism: Towards conceptual refinement and operationalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |pages=445\u2013446}}</ref> There is often a limitation on the choices that the members can choose from due to the heavy direction given by the leader.\n\nThe term paternalism is from the Latin pater meaning \"father\". The leader is most often a male. This leadership style is often found in Russia, Africa, and Pacific Asian Societies.<ref name=\"Aycan\"/>\n\n==Leadership differences affected by gender==\n{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}\nAnother factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.

These barriers also change according to different cultures. Despite the increasing number of female leaders in the world, only a small fraction come from non-westernized cultures. It is important to note that although the barriers listed below may be more severe in non-western culture, it does not imply that westernized cultures do not have these barriers as well. This aims to compare the differences between the two.\n\n'''Research and Literature'''\nAlthough there have been many studies done on leadership for women in the past decade, very little research has been done for women in paternalistic cultures. The literature and research done for women to emerge into a society that prefers males is lacking.  This ultimately hinders women from knowing how to reach their individual leadership goals, and fails to educate the male counterparts in this disparity.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tsui |author2=Nifadkar |author3=Ou |title=Cross-Cultural Organizational Behavior Research: Advances, Gaps, and Recommendations |journal=Journal of Management |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=426\u2013478 |doi=10.1177/0149206307300818 |year=2007}}</ref>\n\n'''Maternity Leave'''\nStudies have shown the importance of longer  paid maternity leave and the positive effects it has on a female employee's mental health and return to work. In Sweden, it was shown that the increased flexibility in timing for mothers to return to work, decreased the odds of poor mental health reports. In these non-western cultures that mostly follow paternalism, the lack of knowledge on the benefits of maternity leave impact the support given to the women during this important time in their life.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chatrerji |author2=Markowitz |title=Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Maternal Health? |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=2004 |volume=72 |issue=1 |page=16|doi=10.2307/20062092 |jstor=20062092 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10206.pdf }}</ref>\n\n'''Society and Laws'''\nCertain countries that follow paternalism, such as India, still allow for women to be treated unjustly. Child marriage and minor punishments for perpetrators in crime against women, shape the society's view on how females should be treated. This can prevent women from feeling comfortable to speak out in both a personal and professional setting.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Yadav |author2=Singh |title=Gender and Politics of Culture |journal=Political Science |date=2015 |page=77}}</ref>\n\n'''Glass Ceilings and Glass Cliffs'''\nWomen who work in a very paternalistic culture or industry (e.g. oil or engineering industry), often deal with a limitations in their career that prevent them from moving up any further. This association is often due to the mentality that only males carry leadership characteristics. The glass cliff term refers to undesired projects that are often given to women because they have an increase in risk of failure. These undesired projects are given to female employees where they are more likely to fail and leave the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vinkenberg |author2=Engen |author3=Eagly |author4=Johannesen-Schmidt |title=An exploration of stereotypical beliefs about leadership styles: Is transformational leadership a route to womens promotion? |journal=The Leadership Quarterly |date=2011 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=10\u201321|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.12.003 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1313103/LQ_2011_VinkenburgVanEngenEaglyJohannesenSchmidt.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nIn the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day & Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, & Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.\n\nJob performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.\n\n[[File:HierarchyOfLeaderEfficiency.jpg|thumb|Hierarchy Of Leader Efficiency based on Hierarchy of Competence\nand the M5 Work Motivation Model <ref>Igor Kokcharov, Hierarchy of Skills http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015</ref>]]\n\n\"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader\u2019s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader\u2019s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass & Riggio, 2006, p. 47).\"\n<ref>Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>\n\nA [[toxic leader]] is someone who has responsibility over a group of people or an organization, and who abuses the leader\u2013follower relationship by leaving the group or organization in a worse-off condition than when he/she joined it.\n\n==Traits==\n[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Julius Caesar]], one of the world's greatest military leaders]]\nMost theories in the 20th century argued that great leaders were born, not made. Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4 4\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4}}</ref> However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.\n\nDetermination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nSelf-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and [[soft skills|social abilities]] in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nFew great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.\n\n==Ontological-phenomenological model==\nOne of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as \"an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...\". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as \"followers\" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the \"idea of the leader\", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.<ref>Forthcoming in \"The Handbook for Teaching Leadership\", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, & Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682</ref>\n\n==Contexts==\n\n===Organizations===\nAn organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.<ref>{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884\u201389|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life \u2014 the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.\n\nIn prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.<ref name=\"Henry\">{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O.

Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.<ref name=\"Henry\"/>\n\nA leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern & Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader \"as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society.\" Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.<ref>Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.</ref> An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.<ref name=\"Henry\"/> Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}</ref>\n\n===Management===\nOver the years the philosophical terminology of \"[[management]]\" and \"leadership\" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between \"transactional\" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and \"transformational\" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).<ref name=\"Burns\"/>\n\n===Group===\nIn contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P.

Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance.

Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}</ref>\n\nLeaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups.

Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.\n* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.\n\n'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''\n* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.\n* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.\n* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.\n* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.\n* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.\n* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.\n* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.\n* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.\n* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.\n* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.\n\n===Self-leadership===\n[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.<ref>Hackman, M. & Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.</ref> Self-leadership is having a developed sense of who you are, what you can achieve, what are your goals coupled with the ability to affect your emotions, behaviors and communication. At the center of leadership is the person who is motivated to make the difference. Self-leadership is a way toward more effectively leading other people.  <ref>Browning, M (2018). \"Self-Leadership: Why It Matters\"</ref>\n\n===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===\n[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.<ref>van Vugt, M., & Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.</ref> They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Meij | first1 = L. | last2 = Schaveling | first2 = J. | last3 = van Vugt | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 72\u201379 | doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.06.005 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.<ref>Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books</ref> This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.\n\nBy comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a \"[[hippie]] chimp\".<ref>\n[https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/30/070730fa_fact_parker Swingers - The New Yorker<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n</ref>\n\n==Myths==\nLeadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).<ref>Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.</ref><ref>Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.</ref>\n\n===Leadership is innate===\nAccording to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.<ref name=Forsyth>Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.</ref> Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).\n\n===Leadership is possessing power over others===\nAlthough leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people \u2013 rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).<ref name=Forsyth/> Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).\n\n===Leaders are positively influential===\nThe [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.<ref>Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.</ref>\n\n===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===\nIn [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J.

Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them.

Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 1990s to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32\u201341|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}</ref>\n\n==Critical thought==\n\n[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 \"[[Great Man theory]]\", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to \"great men\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Popper\n| first1 = Karl\n| author-link1 = Karl Popper\n| year = 1945\n| chapter = Preface to the First Edition\n| title = The Open Society and Its Enemies \n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw9wV2Unpe8C\n| edition = 7\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2012\n| page = xxxiii\n| isbn = 9781136749773\n| access-date = 2017-08-20\n| quote = [...] if our civilisation is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.

{"title_page": "Marketization", "text_new": "{{expert needed|Business|ex2=Economics|date=September 2008}}\n{{Economic systems sidebar |Transition}}\n'''Marketisation''' or '''marketization''' is a restructuring process that enables [[state enterprise]]s to operate as market-oriented firms by changing the legal environment in which they operate.<ref>Rolph van der Hoeven, Gy\u00f6rgy Szir\u00e1czki. ''Lessons from Privatization.'' (1997). International Labour Organization. {{ISBN|92-2-109452-9}} p.101</ref>\n\nThis is achieved through reduction of state subsidies, organizational restructuring of management ([[corporatization]]), [[decentralization]] and in some cases partial [[privatization]].<ref>Sarah Vickerstaff. ''The Transformation of Labour Relations.'' (1998). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-828979-0}} p.63</ref> These steps, it is argued, will lead to the creation of a functioning market system by converting the previous state enterprises to operate under market pressures as state-owned commercial enterprises.\n\n==Aspects==\n\n===Marketized solutions of government and market externalities===\nHere the government seeks to solve market and government [[externality|externalities]] with market-based [[solution]]s rather than through direct administrative means. Supporters argue that the market externality of [[pollution]] can be addressed through the sale of pollution permits to companies and corporations, thus allowing the market to \"see\" the information and \"realize\" the harm done by allowing the market to transmit pollution [[cost]]s to [[society]]. This is presented as an alternative to direct administrative means, whereby the government would use command and control means to direct state enterprises and private firms to comply with the guidelines.\n\n===Marketization of government branches===\nThis is often described as \"competitive federalism\" or \"limited government\". Proponents argue that markets perform better than government administration. Therefore, marketisation seeks to make government agencies and branches compete with each other when government branches and agencies are absolutely necessary (i.e. remaining agencies and branches not privatized or liberalized away). For example, supporters argue that a [[voucher]] system for public education would make public schools compete with one another thus making them more accountable and efficient.\n\n==Theory==\nCritics of [[globalization]], [[privatization]], and [[liberalization]] have deemed that it is unworkable without major [[government regulation]]s to balance the forces involved. They argue that marketization can result in [[market failure]].\n\nFree Market thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]], [[Friedman]] and [[von Mises]] believe markets can work with far less government regulation.  As they see it, the combination of liberalization, privatization, and marketization ensure that globalization fulfills the promises of peace, prosperity, and cooperation that its liberal scholars and philosophers have promised. Without marketization, supporters argue that government created externalities can distort the information available to the market which in turn makes the market not work as well as it could.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Milton Friedman]] offers examples of what marketized government solutions can look like.  Friedman's proposed [[school voucher|education voucher]] system promotes competition between public schools (and private) thus creating a market-based solution to educational issues.\nSee [[Private prison]]. This phenomenon is now permeating into Higher Education in general, with research suggesting that students rather than being perceived as learners are now viewed as customers and therefore a critical component in the business model of many universities\n<ref>Jabbar, A., Analoui, B., Kong, K., & Mirza, M. (2017). Consumerisation in UK higher education business schools: higher fees, greater stress and debatable outcomes. Higher Education. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-017-0196-z</ref>\n\n==Marketization of the nonprofit and voluntary sector==\n\n===Overview of nonprofit organizations===\n[[Nonprofit organizations]] came to fruition when people began to recognize that society had needs for services rendered by neither the government nor the private sector.  These organizations were created to address these needs.  However, due to their overall missions, it is frowned upon for these organizations to make a profit.  Therefore, by their very nature, their funding sources remain ambiguous.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Child|first1=Curtis|title=Whither the Turn? The Ambiguous Nature of Nonprofits' Commercial Revenue|journal=Social Forces|date=September 2010|volume=89|issue=1|pages=145\u2013161|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0058}}</ref> This results in nonprofits becoming resource dependent and continuing to struggle to find and maintain funding.  This struggle has resulted in marketization of NPOs.\n\n====Rationale behind the marketization of nonprofits====\n[[Commercialization]] or marketization (the terms are often used interchangeably in the marketization debate among scholars) occurs when an NPO decides to provide goods or services with the intent of turning a profit. Nonprofits' resource dependency often lead them to constantly look for additional, nonconventional for nonprofit, funding.  Factors behind a nonprofits decision to marketize are usually compounded by issues such as increased demand for services, inability to tax, and other funding sources' inability to cover operational and service costs for the NPO. In return, the NPO enters into a mixed marketplace and thus begins to compete either with other NPO's or for-profit entities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=Howard P.|title=Competition, Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175\u2013194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<175::aid-pam4>3.0.co;2-e}}</ref>\n\n====Funding sources====\nNonprofit organizations have been notoriously plagued with funding issues since their inception. This is due largely in part to the basic concept of nonprofits: to provide a service that neither the government nor the private sector provides a population. Nonprofit organizations receive funding in three ways: 1. Public sources and subsidies; 2. Charitable giving, endowments, major donors; 3. Fee-based services and venture enterprises.\n\n====Public sources and subsidies====\nA public source refers to government assistance either through awarded grants or appropriated funding.  Prior to the 1960s, nonprofit organizations relied mostly on fee-for-services and charitable giving.  However, with the political climate changing significantly, it became apparent that society was using nonprofit organizations more than before.  Additionally, governmental entities realized that by entering into a public-private partnership, they could fund nonprofit organizations and essentially hire then to provide services that governments did not want to provide.  Nonprofit organizations began to apply and receive grant awards and appropriations for services.  This trend in funding began to decline in the 1980s under the Reagan administration. With the reduction in funding available from the federal government, nonprofits have become increasingly competitive amongst each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=Howard P.|title=Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175\u2013194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<175::aid-pam4>3.0.co;2-e}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, grant money often comes with performance measures or quotas that are required to meet in order to maintain funding.  Many nonprofits do not have either the administrative capacity to track this data or the ability to physically meet the performance measures.\n\n====Charitable giving, endowments, and major donors====\nCharitable giving, endowments and donations do play a significant role in funding for NPOs.  However, this still does not provide enough funding for NPOs to maintain sustainability and provide adequate services.\n\n====Fee-for-services====\nA fee-based service is not a new concept for nonprofit organizations. Prior to the 1960s, nonprofits quite often utilized a fee-for-service model.  This most commonly is seen in nonprofit hospitals.  Additionally, gift shops at museums are another form of revenue often associated with fee-for-service models.\n\n===Perspectives on marketization: A pro/con discussion of current literature===\nLiterature related to the marketization of the nonprofit and [[voluntary sector]] is broad in scope and enhanced marketization of the sector is the subject of \u201cconsiderable debate among both scholars and practitioners.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=Matthew|title=Theorizing Nonprofit Organizations as Contradictory Enterprises: Understanding the Inherent Tensions of Nonprofit Marketization|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|date=2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=179\u2013185|doi=10.1177/0893318911423761}}</ref> One side of the debate asserts potential positive effects from increased marketization and one side engages the idea that primarily negative effects are associated with the integration of commercial ideology within [[nonprofit organization]]s.\n\n====Pro====\nMarketization is seen by some to hold the ability to provide positive outcomes for nonprofit organizations. One such potential benefit is the diversification of revenue streams and enhanced financial stability. With commercial and market approaches gaining popularity as alternative or supplementary funding sources, their flexibility and less-restrictive nature as revenue sources are noted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Froelich|first1=K.A.|title=Diversification of Revenue Strategies: Evolving Resource Dependence in Nonprofit Organizations|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=1999|volume=28|issue=3|pages=246\u2013268|doi=10.1177/0899764099283002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nPortions of the literature surrounding nonprofit marketization also consider the positive effects that result from the aforementioned diversified and more sustainable collection of revenue streams.  The ability of market-associated activities to \u201ccontribute to an organization\u2019s [[self sufficiency]] and ability to attract and retain staff\u201d is discussed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Baorong|title=Charity for Profit?

One of the main criticisms brought forth against the integration of commercial principles and activities within voluntary organizations is the potential for diversion from the original organization mission. According to Tuckman, a \u201cstrong likelihood exists that the missions of nonprofits engaged in commercial activities will grow more ambiguous over time.\u201d The potential tendency of leadership to increasingly look at activities in terms of revenue is also as a result of increased commercial activity is discussed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=H.P.|title=Competition, Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Public Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175\u2013194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<175::aid-pam4>3.0.co;2-e}}</ref>\n\nStructural organizational changes are also mentioned as a potential negative impact of enhanced commercial activity among nonprofits.

''The Transformation of Labour Relations.'' (1998). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-828979-0}} p.63</ref> These steps, it is argued, will lead to the creation of a functioning market system by converting the previous state enterprises to operate under market pressures as state-owned commercial enterprises.\n\n==Aspects==\n\n===Marketized solutions of government and market externalities===\nHere the government seeks to solve market and government [[externality|externalities]] with market-based [[solution]]s rather than through direct administrative means. Supporters argue that the market externality of [[pollution]] can be addressed through the sale of pollution permits to companies and corporations, thus allowing the market to \"see\" the information and \"realize\" the harm done by allowing the market to transmit pollution [[cost]]s to [[society]]. This is presented as an alternative to direct administrative means, whereby the government would use command and control means to direct state enterprises and private firms to comply with the guidelines.\n\n===Marketization of government branches===\nThis is often described as \"competitive federalism\" or \"limited government\". Proponents argue that markets perform better than government administration. Therefore, marketisation seeks to make government agencies and branches compete with each other when government branches and agencies are absolutely necessary (i.e. remaining agencies and branches not privatized or liberalized away). For example, supporters argue that a [[voucher]] system for public education would make public schools compete with one another thus making them more accountable and efficient.\n\n==Theory==\nCritics of [[globalization]], [[privatization]], and [[liberalization]] have deemed that it is unworkable without major [[government regulation]]s to balance the forces involved. They argue that marketization can result in [[market failure]].\n\nFree Market thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]], [[Friedman]] and [[von Mises]] believe markets can work with far less government regulation.  As they see it, the combination of liberalization, privatization, and marketization ensure that globalization fulfills the promises of peace, prosperity, and cooperation that its liberal scholars and philosophers have promised. Without marketization, supporters argue that government created externalities can distort the information available to the market which in turn makes the market not work as well as it could.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Milton Friedman]] offers examples of what marketized government solutions can look like.  Friedman's proposed [[school voucher|education voucher]] system promotes competition between public schools (and private) thus creating a market-based solution to educational issues.\nSee [[Private prison]]. This phenomenon is now permeating into Higher Education in general, with research suggesting that students rather than being perceived as learners are now viewed as customers and therefore a critical component in the business model of many universities\n<ref>Jabbar, A., Analoui, B., Kong, K., & Mirza, M. (2017). Consumerisation in UK higher education business schools: higher fees, greater stress and debatable outcomes. Higher Education. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-017-0196-z</ref>\n\n==Marketization of the nonprofit and voluntary sector==\n\n===Overview of nonprofit organizations===\n[[Nonprofit organizations]] came to fruition when people began to recognize that society had needs for services rendered by neither the government nor the private sector.  These organizations were created to address these needs.  However, due to their overall missions, it is frowned upon for these organizations to make a profit.  Therefore, by their very nature, their funding sources remain ambiguous.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Child|first1=Curtis|title=Whither the Turn? The Ambiguous Nature of Nonprofits' Commercial Revenue|journal=Social Forces|date=September 2010|volume=89|issue=1|pages=145\u2013161|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0058}}</ref> This results in nonprofits becoming resource dependent and continuing to struggle to find and maintain funding.  This struggle has resulted in marketization of NPOs.\n\n====Rationale behind the marketization of nonprofits====\n[[Commercialization]] or marketization (the terms are often used interchangeably in the marketization debate among scholars) occurs when an NPO decides to provide goods or services with the intent of turning a profit. Nonprofits' resource dependency often lead them to constantly look for additional, nonconventional for nonprofit, funding.  Factors behind a nonprofits decision to marketize are usually compounded by issues such as increased demand for services, inability to tax, and other funding sources' inability to cover operational and service costs for the NPO. In return, the NPO enters into a mixed marketplace and thus begins to compete either with other NPO's or for-profit entities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=Howard P.|title=Competition, Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175\u2013194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<175::aid-pam4>3.0.co;2-e}}</ref>\n\n====Funding sources====\nNonprofit organizations have been notoriously plagued with funding issues since their inception. This is due largely in part to the basic concept of nonprofits: to provide a service that neither the government nor the private sector provides a population. Nonprofit organizations receive funding in three ways: 1. Public sources and subsidies; 2. Charitable giving, endowments, major donors; 3. Fee-based services and venture enterprises.\n\n====Public sources and subsidies====\nA public source refers to government assistance either through awarded grants or appropriated funding.  Prior to the 1960s, nonprofit organizations relied mostly on fee-for-services and charitable giving.  However, with the political climate changing significantly, it became apparent that society was using nonprofit organizations more than before.  Additionally, governmental entities realized that by entering into a public-private partnership, they could fund nonprofit organizations and essentially hire then to provide services that governments did not want to provide.  Nonprofit organizations began to apply and receive grant awards and appropriations for services.  This trend in funding began to decline in the 1980s under the Reagan administration. With the reduction in funding available from the federal government, nonprofits have become increasingly competitive amongst each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=Howard P.|title=Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175\u2013194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<175::aid-pam4>3.0.co;2-e}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, grant money often comes with performance measures or quotas that are required to meet in order to maintain funding.  Many nonprofits do not have either the administrative capacity to track this data or the ability to physically meet the performance measures.\n\n====Charitable giving, endowments, and major donors====\nCharitable giving, endowments and donations do play a significant role in funding for NPOs.  However, this still does not provide enough funding for NPOs to maintain sustainability and provide adequate services.\n\n====Fee-for-services====\nA fee-based service is not a new concept for nonprofit organizations. Prior to the 1960s, nonprofits quite often utilized a fee-for-service model.  This most commonly is seen in nonprofit hospitals.  Additionally, gift shops at museums are another form of revenue often associated with fee-for-service models.\n\n===Perspectives on marketization: A pro/con discussion of current literature===\nLiterature related to the marketization of the nonprofit and [[voluntary sector]] is broad in scope and enhanced marketization of the sector is the subject of \u201cconsiderable debate among both scholars and practitioners.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=Matthew|title=Theorizing Nonprofit Organizations as Contradictory Enterprises: Understanding the Inherent Tensions of Nonprofit Marketization|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|date=2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=179\u2013185|doi=10.1177/0893318911423761}}</ref> One side of the debate asserts potential positive effects from increased marketization and one side engages the idea that primarily negative effects are associated with the integration of commercial ideology within [[nonprofit organization]]s.\n\n====Pro====\nMarketization is seen by some to hold the ability to provide positive outcomes for nonprofit organizations. One such potential benefit is the diversification of revenue streams and enhanced financial stability. With commercial and market approaches gaining popularity as alternative or supplementary funding sources, their flexibility and less-restrictive nature as revenue sources are noted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Froelich|first1=K.A.|title=Diversification of Revenue Strategies: Evolving Resource Dependence in Nonprofit Organizations|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=1999|volume=28|issue=3|pages=246\u2013268|doi=10.1177/0899764099283002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nPortions of the literature surrounding nonprofit marketization also consider the positive effects that result from the aforementioned diversified and more sustainable collection of revenue streams.  The ability of market-associated activities to \u201ccontribute to an organization\u2019s [[self sufficiency]] and ability to attract and retain staff\u201d is discussed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Baorong|title=Charity for Profit?

One of the main criticisms brought forth against the integration of commercial principles and activities within voluntary organizations is the potential for diversion from the original organization mission. According to Tuckman, a \u201cstrong likelihood exists that the missions of nonprofits engaged in commercial activities will grow more ambiguous over time.\u201d The potential tendency of leadership to increasingly look at activities in terms of revenue is also as a result of increased commercial activity is discussed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuckman|first1=H.P.|title=Competition, Commercialization, and the Evolution of Nonprofit Organizational Structures|journal=Public Policy Analysis and Management|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=175\u2013194|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199821)17:2<175::aid-pam4>3.0.co;2-e}}</ref>\n\nStructural organizational changes are also mentioned as a potential negative impact of enhanced commercial activity among nonprofits. From organizational changes necessary to accommodate market-based endeavors, such as growth in \u201cnumber and scope\u201d of administrative offices that manage profit-seeking efforts, to the \u201ctendency to replace traditional, social problem-focused board members with entrepreneurial, business-oriented individuals,\u201d changes take effort from work directly related to mission accomplishment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Froelich|first1=Karen|title=Diversification of Revenue Strategies: Evolving Resource Dependence in Nonprofit Organizations|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=1999|volume=28|issue=3|pages=246\u2013268|doi=10.1177/0899764099283002|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAside from diversion from mission and structural/staffing changes, the literature notes the potential for lost sector legitimacy as the \u201cdistinctions between the business, government, and nonprofit sectors continue to blur and their efforts overlap.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frumkin|first1=Peter|title=On Being Nonprofit: A Conceptual and Policy Primer|date=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref> Related to this blurring effect, is the theory that [[civil society]] is at risk as a result of enhanced marketization within the voluntary organizations.
