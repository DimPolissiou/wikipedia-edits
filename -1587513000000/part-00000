At that time there were few people living close by so the railway station was called \u2018Chautala Road\u2019 after the name of the village Chautala situated in Haryana at a distance of {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from here.

About 1980, the [[United States Postal Service]] detached the two-thirds of greater Oxon Hill that was furthest from Washington, D.C. and re-defined that part as a new postal designation, [[Fort Washington, MD]]. To make mail sorting easier at that time, the new postal boundary line separating the two Maryland communities was drawn along already existing [[zip code]] boundaries. (The former zip 20021 portion of Oxon Hill remained Oxon Hill with the new code 20745, while everything in the former zip 20022 portion of Oxon Hill about 1980 was automatically renamed the new Fort Washington 20744.) Illogically, this partitioning reassigned some areas that seem to be almost in the heart of Oxon Hill (such as all of the Bock Road, Tucker Road, Murray Hills, and Brinkley Road areas, including several large prominent churches, Rosecroft Raceway, the ice rink, and ironically even Oxon Hill Middle School) to Fort Washington mailing addresses, which can cause confusion.\n\n==Geography==\nOxon Hill is located in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] along [[Maryland Route 210]] (Indian Head Highway) and [[Maryland Route 414]] (Oxon Hill Road), less than {{convert|2|mi|0}} south of the boundary of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

To make mail sorting easier at that time, the new postal boundary line separating the two Maryland communities was drawn along already existing [[zip code]] boundaries. (The former zip 20021 portion of Oxon Hill remained Oxon Hill with the new code 20745, while everything in the former zip 20022 portion of Oxon Hill about 1980 was automatically renamed the new Fort Washington 20744.) Illogically, this partitioning reassigned some areas that seem to be almost in the heart of Oxon Hill (such as all of the Bock Road, Tucker Road, Murray Hills, and Brinkley Road areas, including several large prominent churches, Rosecroft Raceway, the ice rink, and ironically even Oxon Hill Middle School) to Fort Washington mailing addresses, which can cause confusion.\n\n==Geography==\nOxon Hill is located in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] along [[Maryland Route 210]] (Indian Head Highway) and [[Maryland Route 414]] (Oxon Hill Road), less than {{convert|2|mi|0}} south of the boundary of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].
