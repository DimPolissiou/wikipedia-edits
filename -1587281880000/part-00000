During the [[British Raj]], the town of [[Cooch Behar]] was the seat of a [[princely state]] of [[Koch Bihar]], ruled by the Koch dynasty.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main| Etymology of Cooch Behar}}\nThe name ''Cooch Behar'' is derived from the name of the Koch or ''[[Rajbongshi people|Rajbongshi]]'' tribes indigenous to this region for many centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first= Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | pages = 11\u201312}}</ref> The word ''behar'' is derived from {{lang-sa| \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930}} ''[[vihara]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maharaja-Jagaddipendra-Narayan.jpg|right|thumb|Maharaja Nripendra Narayan]]\n\n===Early period===\n{{See also|Koch dynasty|Kamarupa Kingdom}}\n\nCooch Behar formed part of the [[Kamarupa Kingdom]] of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the [[Kamata Kingdom]], first ruled by the [[Khen dynasty]] from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 [[Common Era|CE]], when they fell to [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]], the independent Pathan Sultan of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gour]]. The new invaders fought with the local [[Bhuyan chieftains]] and the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Suhungmung]] and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself ''Kamateshwar'' (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty.\n\nThe first important Koch ruler was [[Biswa Singha]], who came to power in 1510 or 1530 CE.<ref name=\"web2\">[http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html Royal history of Cooch Behar]. Coochbehar.nic.in (1 January 1950).

He became governor of its eastern portion.\n\nAfter Chilarai's death, his son [[Raghudev]] became governor of this portion. Since Nara Narayan did not have a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the [[Sankosh river]]. This area came to be known as [[Koch Hajo]]. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, [[Lakshmi Narayan]], came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself with the [[Mughal Empire]] and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of [[Assam]].\n\nAs the early capital of the Koch Kingdom, Cooch Behar's location was not static and became stable only when shifted to Cooch Behar town. Maharaja [[Rup Narayan]], on the advice of an unknown saint, transferred the capital from [[Attharokotha]] to [[Guriahati]] (now called Cooch Behar town) on the banks of the [[Torsa river]] between 1693 and 1714. After this, the capital was always in or near its present location.\n\nIn 1661 CE, Maharaja [[Pran Narayan]] planned to expand his kingdom. However, [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], the [[subedar]] of [[Bengal]] under the Mughal emperor [[Aurangazeb]], attacked Cooch Behar and conquered the territory, meeting almost no resistance.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first=Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | page = 68}}</ref>\nThe town of Cooch Behar was subsequently named Alamgirnagar.<ref name=\"bnpedia1\">{{cite book |last=Bhattacharyya |first=PK |year=2012 |chapter=Kamata-Koch Behar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kamata-Koch_Behar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Maharaja Pran Narayan regained his kingdom within a few days.\n\n===British Raj===\n[[Image:1907-bengal-sikkim3.jpg|left|thumb|1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim]]\n{{main|Koch Bihar}}\nIn 1772\u20131773, the king of [[Bhutan]] attacked and captured Cooch Behar.

Bengal]], India, as well as the district's namesake town. During the [[British Raj]], the town of [[Cooch Behar]] was the seat of a [[princely state]] of [[Koch Bihar]], ruled by the Koch dynasty.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main| Etymology of Cooch Behar}}\nThe name ''Cooch Behar'' is derived from the name of the Koch or ''[[Rajbongshi people|Rajbongshi]]'' tribes indigenous to this region for many centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first= Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | pages = 11\u201312}}</ref> The word ''behar'' is derived from {{lang-sa| \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930}} ''[[vihara]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Maharaja-Jagaddipendra-Narayan.jpg|right|thumb|Maharaja Nripendra Narayan]]\n\n===Early period===\n{{See also|Koch dynasty|Kamarupa Kingdom}}\n\nCooch Behar formed part of the [[Kamarupa Kingdom]] of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the [[Kamata Kingdom]], first ruled by the [[Khen dynasty]] from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 [[Common Era|CE]], when they fell to [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]], the independent Pathan Sultan of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gour]]. The new invaders fought with the local [[Bhuyan chieftains]] and the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] king [[Suhungmung]] and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself ''Kamateshwar'' (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty.\n\nThe first important Koch ruler was [[Biswa Singha]], who came to power in 1510 or 1530 CE.<ref name=\"web2\">[http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html Royal history of Cooch Behar].

He became governor of its eastern portion.\n\nAfter Chilarai's death, his son [[Raghudev]] became governor of this portion. Since Nara Narayan did not have a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the [[Sankosh river]]. This area came to be known as [[Koch Hajo]]. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, [[Lakshmi Narayan]], came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself with the [[Mughal Empire]] and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of [[Assam]].\n\nAs the early capital of the Koch Kingdom, Cooch Behar's location was not static and became stable only when shifted to Cooch Behar town. Maharaja [[Rup Narayan]], on the advice of an unknown saint, transferred the capital from [[Attharokotha]] to [[Guriahati]] (now called Cooch Behar town) on the banks of the [[Torsa river]] between 1693 and 1714. After this, the capital was always in or near its present location.\n\nIn 1661 CE, Maharaja [[Pran Narayan]] planned to expand his kingdom. However, [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], the [[subedar]] of [[Bengal]] under the Mughal emperor [[Aurangazeb]], attacked Cooch Behar and conquered the territory, meeting almost no resistance.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pal |first=Dr. Nripendra Nath |title= Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar) |year=2000 |publisher=Anima Prakashani |location=Kolkata | page = 68}}</ref>\nThe town of Cooch Behar was subsequently named Alamgirnagar.<ref name=\"bnpedia1\">{{cite book |last=Bhattacharyya |first=PK |year=2012 |chapter=Kamata-Koch Behar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kamata-Koch_Behar |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Maharaja Pran Narayan regained his kingdom within a few days.\n\n===British Raj===\n[[Image:1907-bengal-sikkim3.jpg|left|thumb|1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim]]\n{{main|Koch Bihar}}\nIn 1772\u20131773, the king of [[Bhutan]] attacked and captured Cooch Behar.
