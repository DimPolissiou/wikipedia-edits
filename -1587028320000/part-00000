''[[Resident Evil - Code: Veronica]]''. This game was designed from the ground up for the [[Dreamcast]]. Being a much more powerful console than the PlayStation, the Dreamcast allowed the team behind the game to add for the first time, 3D environments instead of the usual pre-rendered backgrounds. ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'' was released in 2000 and went on to sell 1,140,000 units.

This version of the game, titled ''Biohazard - Code: Veronica Complete Edition'' in Japan and ''[[Resident Evil - Code: Veronica#Re-releases|Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X]]'' abroad, added ten minutes of new cutscenes not in the original release. The PS2 version, which initially came packaged with a trial version of ''Devil May Cry'', went on to sell 1,400,000 units, according to Capcom's sales data for March 2006.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2001, in what was to be one of his most controversial business decisions, Mikami formed an exclusivity agreement with [[Nintendo]] in which the main ''Resident Evil'' games would be sold only for the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. The GameCube would receive, in addition to ports of previous PlayStation and Dreamcast installments, three new numbered entries in the series: a [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|remake of the original ''Resident Evil'']], ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. ''Resident Evil'' and ''Resident Evil Zero'' were both released in 2002.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe [[video game remake|remake]] of ''Resident Evil'' was released in Japan on the sixth anniversary of the release of the original, on March 22, 2002. The remake was billed as the definitive version of the game, selling 490,000 copies in the US and 360,000 copies in Europe. In total, ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' managed to sell 1,250,000 units during its first year of release. The remake's sales data was made public by Capcom during its Financial Review Report for 2002.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nOn November 12, 2002, ''Resident Evil Zero'' was released. Gaming site gamefront.de reported that 138,855 copies of the game were sold on its first day of release. Capcom expected ''Resident Evil Zero'' to sell 1.42 million copies, but sold only 1.12 million. The fact that ''Resident Evil Zero'' did not match or surpass the remake's sales figures, spread fear among Capcom executives and share holders. They worried that ''Resident Evil 4'' would not sell well enough on GameCube.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Capcom Five, ''Resident Evil 4'', and Capcom split (2002\u20132004)===\n{{further|Capcom Five|Resident Evil 4}}\nIn spite of ''Resident Evil Zero''{{'}}s underwhelming sales, Mikami remained confident in his support for Nintendo and announced four exclusive titles for the GameCube under development by Production Studio 4 in addition to ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''; ''[[P.N.03]]'', ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', ''[[killer7]]'' and ''[[Dead Phoenix]]''. This lineup became known as the [[Capcom Five]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe first of these games to be released was the Mikami-directed ''P.N. 03''. The game was both a commercial and critical failure,<ref name=\"uk.ign.com\"/> receiving lukewarm reviews from the press and selling below expectations. As a result, Mikami stepped down as manager of Production Studio 4, while remaining as one of the head producers within the team.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} After his failure with ''P.N.03'', Mikami decided to concentrate instead on the creative aspects of the Capcom 5. He eventually took over directorial duties for ''Resident Evil 4'' from previous director, Hiroshi Shibata. Under his direction, ''Resident Evil 4'' went through some substantial changes.

Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in ''Resident Evil'', and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it.<ref name=\"horrorfilm\">{{cite book | title = Horror Film | editor = Steffen Hantke | author = Richard J.

As producer, he oversaw the development of ''Resident Evil's'' [[sequel]], ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', which he intended to tap into the classic notion of horror as \"the ordinary made strange,\" thus rather than setting the game in a creepy mansion no one would visit, he wanted to use familiar urban settings transformed by the chaos of a viral outbreak. The game sold over five million copies, proving the popularity of survival horror. Following its release in 1998, he oversaw the development of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' and also directed another survival horror title ''[[Dino Crisis (video game)|Dino Crisis]]'', both of which released in 1999.<ref name=\"ignhistory5\">{{cite web | author = Travis Fahs | url = http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/104/1040759p5.html | title = IGN Presents the History of Survival Horror (Page 5) | website = IGN | accessdate=2011-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Capcom Production Studio 4 (1999\u20132002)===\nShortly after the release of ''Resident Evil 3'' in Japan, [[Capcom Production Studio|Capcom Production Studio 4]] was established in 1999. The studio's staff were mainly the key developers in the company's survival horror projects. Mikami was appointed as the general manager of the studio, and worked as [[executive producer]] for various games, including the original ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' (originally conceived as a ''Resident Evil'' game).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kevin Gifford, Mark MacDonald |date=April 2005 |title=Afterthoughts: Resident Evil 4 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis Media Inc.]] |issue=190 |pages=51\u201352}}</ref> In 2000, Mikami became involved as producer of a new ''Resident Evil'' game. ''[[Resident Evil - Code: Veronica]]''. This game was designed from the ground up for the [[Dreamcast]]. Being a much more powerful console than the PlayStation, the Dreamcast allowed the team behind the game to add for the first time, 3D environments instead of the usual pre-rendered backgrounds. ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'' was released in 2000 and went on to sell 1,140,000 units. That same year, Mikami's ''[[Dino Crisis 2]]'' was released, selling 1,190,000 copies worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CAPCOM Platinum Titles |url=http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/business/million.html |work=Capcom.co.jp |accessdate=2019-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505174010/http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/business/million.html |archivedate=May 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, an expanded version of ''Code: Veronica'' was released for the Dreamcast exclusively in Japan, alongside a [[PlayStation 2]] port that was released worldwide. This version of the game, titled ''Biohazard - Code: Veronica Complete Edition'' in Japan and ''[[Resident Evil - Code: Veronica#Re-releases|Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X]]'' abroad, added ten minutes of new cutscenes not in the original release. The PS2 version, which initially came packaged with a trial version of ''Devil May Cry'', went on to sell 1,400,000 units, according to Capcom's sales data for March 2006.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2001, in what was to be one of his most controversial business decisions, Mikami formed an exclusivity agreement with [[Nintendo]] in which the main ''Resident Evil'' games would be sold only for the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. The GameCube would receive, in addition to ports of previous PlayStation and Dreamcast installments, three new numbered entries in the series: a [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|remake of the original ''Resident Evil'']], ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. ''Resident Evil'' and ''Resident Evil Zero'' were both released in 2002.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe [[video game remake|remake]] of ''Resident Evil'' was released in Japan on the sixth anniversary of the release of the original, on March 22, 2002. The remake was billed as the definitive version of the game, selling 490,000 copies in the US and 360,000 copies in Europe. In total, ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' managed to sell 1,250,000 units during its first year of release. The remake's sales data was made public by Capcom during its Financial Review Report for 2002.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nOn November 12, 2002, ''Resident Evil Zero'' was released. Gaming site gamefront.de reported that 138,855 copies of the game were sold on its first day of release. Capcom expected ''Resident Evil Zero'' to sell 1.42 million copies, but sold only 1.12 million. The fact that ''Resident Evil Zero'' did not match or surpass the remake's sales figures, spread fear among Capcom executives and share holders. They worried that ''Resident Evil 4'' would not sell well enough on GameCube.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Capcom Five, ''Resident Evil 4'', and Capcom split (2002\u20132004)===\n{{further|Capcom Five|Resident Evil 4}}\nIn spite of ''Resident Evil Zero''{{'}}s underwhelming sales, Mikami remained confident in his support for Nintendo and announced four exclusive titles for the GameCube under development by Production Studio 4 in addition to ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''; ''[[P.N.03]]'', ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', ''[[killer7]]'' and ''[[Dead Phoenix]]''. This lineup became known as the [[Capcom Five]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe first of these games to be released was the Mikami-directed ''P.N. 03''. The game was both a commercial and critical failure,<ref name=\"uk.ign.com\"/> receiving lukewarm reviews from the press and selling below expectations. As a result, Mikami stepped down as manager of Production Studio 4, while remaining as one of the head producers within the team.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} After his failure with ''P.N.03'', Mikami decided to concentrate instead on the creative aspects of the Capcom 5. He eventually took over directorial duties for ''Resident Evil 4'' from previous director, Hiroshi Shibata. Under his direction, ''Resident Evil 4'' went through some substantial changes. ''Resident Evil 4'' was released in 2005<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/95450/Capcom_Adds_Resident_Evil_4_to_PlayStation_2_LineUp.php</ref> and was one of the GameCube's top-selling titles, selling 1,250,000 units worldwide within a year. The game was critically praised, winning many game of the year awards.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n''Resident Evil 4'' is regarded as one of the most influential games of the 2000s decade, due to its influence in redefining at least two [[video game genres]]: the [[survival horror]] and the [[third-person shooter]].<ref name=nationalpost>{{cite web|title=Decade in Review: The most influential video games since Y2K|date=December 30, 2009|author=Daniel Kaszor|work=[[The National Post]]|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/theampersand/archive/2009/12/30/370674.aspx|accessdate=2010-01-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100609234921/http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/theampersand/archive/2009/12/30/370674.aspx|archivedate=June 9, 2010}}</ref> ''Resident Evil 4'' attempted to redefine the survival horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/capcoms-re4-reinvigorates-the-franchise/67572/?biz=1 |title=Capcom's RE4 Reinvigorates the Franchise |author=James Brightman |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214160947/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/capcoms-re4-reinvigorates-the-franchise/67572/?biz=1 |archivedate=February 14, 2008 }}</ref> thus broadening the gameplay of the series with elements from the wider action game genre.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ugo.com/movies/gateway-to-horror/?cur=gateway-to-horror-games-resident-evil-4 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120605051156/http://www.ugo.com/movies/gateway-to-horror/?cur=gateway-to-horror-games-resident-evil-4 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-06-05 | title = Gateway to Horror | publisher = [[UGO Networks]] | date = 2008-10-17 | accessdate = 2009-04-16 }}</ref> It helped redefine the third-person shooter genre by introducing a \"reliance on offset camera angles that fail to obscure the action.\"<ref>Dobson, Jason, [http://www.gamasutra.com/news/gdc/?story=13106 Post-GDC: Cliff Bleszinski Says Iteration Won Gears of War], ''[[Gamasutra]]'', Mar 12, 2007, Accessed Apr 2, 2009</ref> The \"over the shoulder\" viewpoint introduced in ''Resident Evil 4'' has now become standard in third-person shooters, including titles ranging from ''[[Gears of War (series)|Gears of War]]'' to ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''.<ref name=nationalpost/> It has also become a standard \u201cprecision aim\u201d feature for [[action game]]s in general, with examples ranging from ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' to the ''[[Ratchet & Clank#Future Trilogy|Ratchet & Clank Future]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/gamings-most-important-evolutions/|title=Gaming's most important evolutions|first=GamesRadar_ US 2010-10-09T05:00:03 281Z|last=Feature|website=gamesradar|accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMikami touted the game as a GameCube exclusive.

At Clover, Mikami directed ''[[God Hand]]'', a [[beat 'em up]] comedy game that parodies American and Japanese pop culture.

The present-timeline version of the character has little interest in doing so, only pursuing it as a game. The alternate timeline version is activated after Goku's death, murdering the other characters and having a twenty-year reign of terror on Earth until being killed by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Future Trunks]]. They serve as the de facto antagonists of the second act of the third volume of the ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'' manga, as well as the third season of the anime adaptation ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', only to be supplanted by fellow android [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]], whose purpose was to physically absorb the twins into himself to fully evolve into his complete form. He later returns in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' as a protagonist, featured prominently in the Tournament of Power storyline.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== In ''Dragon Ball Z'' ===\nAndroid #17 is activated by Dr. Gero after Gero fails to terminate Goku. #18 is activated a short time after, and the group of androids are discovered by the heroes, Dr. Gero ordering #17 and #18 to terminate them while Android #17 remains passive until killing Gero. After surviving a full power attack from [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], the androids activate #16<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 156</ref> and begin a quest to find Goku out of pure entertainment, being confronted by [[Vegeta]] who begins a duel with #18. #17 is content with allowing the pair to combat each other but warns against the other heroes joining in as he would get involved,<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 158</ref> doing so after Trunks attacks #18 once she breaks Vegeta's arm, #17 easily defeating [[Piccolo]] and [[Tenshinhan]]. [[Krillin]] confronts Android #17 over his intent to kill Goku, trying to talk him out of it and failing.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 160</ref> Continuing their search, the androids arrive at Goku's home, finding no one there and then journeying to Kame House, where they find several of Goku's friends, Piccolo stepping up to combat them. #17 agrees to the battle and they fight an even match until Cell arrives, able to find the group thanks to the outpouring of power on Piccolo's part. #17 is confused to see the bio android, Piccolo revealing Cell's needing to absorb him and #18 to achieve his perfect form. #17 and Piccolo find themselves overwhelmed by Cell, #16 stepping in and proving to be a match against Cell, though insisting that #17 and #18 leave as the pair decline. Cell sneaks up behind #17, being seen by Tenshinhan from the sky who warns #17 moments before he is absorbed and triggers Cell's transforming into his second form.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Say Goodbye, 17|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|number=152|airdate=October 20, 2000}}</ref> #17 dies when Cell self-destructs in a failed attempt to destroy the Earth, being resurrected with the Dragon Balls after Cell's defeat along with all of his other victims and having his bomb removed by a wish from Krillin.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 223<br>\"One More Wish\".

For a time, Gohan and Trunks remain the only ones who can combat the pair in battle, though Gohan is killed by #17, and after this, #17 and #18 are able to defeat Trunks with ease.

The present-timeline version of the character has little interest in doing so, only pursuing it as a game. The alternate timeline version is activated after Goku's death, murdering the other characters and having a twenty-year reign of terror on Earth until being killed by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Future Trunks]]. They serve as the de facto antagonists of the second act of the third volume of the ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'' manga, as well as the third season of the anime adaptation ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', only to be supplanted by fellow android [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]], whose purpose was to physically absorb the twins into himself to fully evolve into his complete form. He later returns in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' as a protagonist, featured prominently in the Tournament of Power storyline.\n\n== Appearances ==\n=== In ''Dragon Ball Z'' ===\nAndroid #17 is activated by Dr. Gero after Gero fails to terminate Goku. #18 is activated a short time after, and the group of androids are discovered by the heroes, Dr. Gero ordering #17 and #18 to terminate them while Android #17 remains passive until killing Gero. After surviving a full power attack from [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], the androids activate #16<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 156</ref> and begin a quest to find Goku out of pure entertainment, being confronted by [[Vegeta]] who begins a duel with #18. #17 is content with allowing the pair to combat each other but warns against the other heroes joining in as he would get involved,<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 158</ref> doing so after Trunks attacks #18 once she breaks Vegeta's arm, #17 easily defeating [[Piccolo]] and [[Tenshinhan]].

Cell sneaks up behind #17, being seen by Tenshinhan from the sky who warns #17 moments before he is absorbed and triggers Cell's transforming into his second form.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Say Goodbye, 17|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|number=152|airdate=October 20, 2000}}</ref> #17 dies when Cell self-destructs in a failed attempt to destroy the Earth, being resurrected with the Dragon Balls after Cell's defeat along with all of his other victims and having his bomb removed by a wish from Krillin.<ref>''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 223<br>\"One More Wish\".

For a time, Gohan and Trunks remain the only ones who can combat the pair in battle, though Gohan is killed by #17, and after this, #17 and #18 are able to defeat Trunks with ease.

It was built in fields between [[Andreas, Isle of Man|Andreas]] and [[Bride, Isle of Man|Bride]]. As was common practice, the station was named after the parish in which it was situated.<ref name=\"CT\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]], in October 1940, began to attack British cities under the cover of darkness, the North West of England with its industrial centres and ports came within easy reach of German aircraft operating from [[occupied France]].  The first fighter squadron had arrived on the [[Isle of Man]] at nearby [[RAF Jurby]] in November 1940, and came under the control of the newly formed [[No. 9 Group RAF]], [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]].  Group Control was positioned at [[RAF Barton Hall]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and its sectors covered [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]].  Andreas was to be a separate sector with responsibility for the Irish Sea and its surrounds.  The new wing of [[Ramsey Grammar School]] was commissioned as Control Centre for the sector and was hastily prepared before the arrival of the new fighters at Jurby.  The Control Centre was linked to [[Chain Home|the three radar stations at Dalby, Scarlett and Bride]].<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p51\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=51.}}</ref>\n\nThe siting of a fighter airfield in the location of Andreas had been chosen because of its central location with regard to [[Liverpool]], [[Belfast]] and [[Glasgow]], as it was in an excellent position to provide protection to the vital shipping arriving at these ports. Finally, with the relevant compensation payments agreed, work on the construction of RAF Andreas began in earnest by the end of June 1940. A total of {{convert|500|acre}} of farmland was earmarked, {{convert|200|acre}} coming from both Ballaghaue Farm and Braust Farm, and a small portion of land was acquired which stretched into the adjacent parish of Bride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturevannin.im/video_story_411491.html |title=World War Two (02) Defending the Island |publisher=[[Culture Vannin]] |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>\n[[File:Andreas Church (reduced tower).jpeg|thumb|left|[[St Andrew's Church, Andreas, Isle of Man|St Andrew's Church, Andreas]]. The tower was reduced on the request of the [[Air Ministry]] as it was seen as a danger to operations from the base.]]\nBy the spring of 1941 the airfield, to be built to the full specification of an operational fighter station, was beginning to take shape.  The main NE/SW runway was {{convert|1100|yd}} long and {{convert|50|yd}} wide and was obviously meant to take larger aircraft than fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forgottenairfields.com/united-kingdom/man/andreas-s961.html |title=Abandoned, Forgotten & Little Known Airfields in Europe: Andreas |website=forgottenairfields.com |author=Ronald V. |date=7 November 2010 |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>  From the perimeter track there was access to the flight dispersals in which a total of 24 blast pens (or E pens) were built, half to provide protection for the fighters while larger ones were for twin-engined aircraft.  Considerable thought had also gone into the airfield's defences, with the whole area being surrounded by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} roller concertina barbed wire, with gaps located at the main entrance and crash gates<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p52\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=52.}}</ref> and by a [[tarmacadam]]ed perimeter track over three miles in distance.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ramsey Courier, Friday, September 14, 1945; Page: 3</ref>\n\nRAF Andreas was designed as a dispersed airfield with many components of the base encompassed into the village of Andreas. The consequence of this was such that the domestic side and living quarters were a considerable distance from the technical side. There was also a dance and entertainments hall in the village and a farm on the Station.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1941 the first RAF personnel arrived at Andreas.  This mainly consisted of a flight of [[Royal Air Force Police]], whose first duties were guarding the stores of supplies kept in the completed hangars.  Others arriving at that time included MT drivers and soldiers of the [[Wiltshire Regiment]], under the command of Major G.K. Wait [[Military Cross|MC]], who arrived to man the airfield's defences, along with the first of many [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]]s whose duties were to staff the administration offices and operations rooms. The station officially opened in August 1941, the first commanding officer of RAF Andreas being [[Group Captain]] J.

It had already been announced that the station would close and that the Gunnery School would transfer to nearby Jurby. The Commanding Officer Group Captain Mackay, and the rest of the station personnel made every effort to show what the work of the station involved.[[File:Blackburn Skua L2923.png|thumb|The Blackburn Skua was operated by No. 275 Air Sea Rescue Squadron, which had a detachment based at RAF Andreas from October 1941.]] On show were the link trainer, parachute packing by the WAAFs and parachute dinghies and equipment used by the Andreas Rescue Station, which had so often been called upon in emergencies.\n\nThe following week the transfer of stores to [[RAF Jurby]] was completed, and the gates of Royal Air Force Andreas were finally closed.\n[[File:Andreas Airfield - Isle of Man - geograph.org.uk - 32328.jpg|thumb|right|The Watch Office ''circa'' 2012.]]\n\n==Subsequent use==\n===Civil Aerodrome===\nPost-war the situation of a civilian aerodrome was a foremost consideration for the government of the Isle of Man with Andreas at the time being generally regarded as the best aerodrome on the Island.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Ramsey Courier.''

These were badly needed to re-house families living in condemned properties in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and to relieve the general housing shortage on the Island as a consequence of the war. Every effort was made to convert the brick-built huts into acceptable two-and three-bedroom homes with electrically heated living rooms and kitchens. Each had a toilet installed, but bathrooms had to be shared. During 1947, a total of 81 families were accommodated as a temporary measure pending the construction of new housing estates. It was to be several years before such new housing was ready, and upon their completion, this temporary housing by now badly affected by damp, was demolished. One structure to survive, was the old gymnasium which still stands, and continues to provide the [[Andreas, Isle of Man|village of Andreas]] with a very useful Parish Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justabouttravel.net/2013/02/01/andreas-parish-hall-isle-of-man-england-isle-of-man-canine-society-dog-show/ |title=Andreas Parish Hall , Isle of Man, England \u2013 Isle of Man Canine Society Dog Show |access-date=16 May 2017 |website=justabouttravel.net }}</ref><ref>''Mona's Herald'', 17 December 1946.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations between the Manx Government and the [[Air Ministry]] were proceeding as to the future of the airfield.

As was common practice, the station was named after the parish in which it was situated.<ref name=\"CT\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Construction===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]], in October 1940, began to attack British cities under the cover of darkness, the North West of England with its industrial centres and ports came within easy reach of German aircraft operating from [[occupied France]].  The first fighter squadron had arrived on the [[Isle of Man]] at nearby [[RAF Jurby]] in November 1940, and came under the control of the newly formed [[No. 9 Group RAF]], [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]].  Group Control was positioned at [[RAF Barton Hall]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and its sectors covered [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]].  Andreas was to be a separate sector with responsibility for the Irish Sea and its surrounds.  The new wing of [[Ramsey Grammar School]] was commissioned as Control Centre for the sector and was hastily prepared before the arrival of the new fighters at Jurby.  The Control Centre was linked to [[Chain Home|the three radar stations at Dalby, Scarlett and Bride]].<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p51\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=51.}}</ref>\n\nThe siting of a fighter airfield in the location of Andreas had been chosen because of its central location with regard to [[Liverpool]], [[Belfast]] and [[Glasgow]], as it was in an excellent position to provide protection to the vital shipping arriving at these ports.

Aged 33, and an experienced bomber pilot, he was considered a great \"''character''\" and reputedly knew how to make a party go with a swing, his prowess at the piano being put to good use.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe morning after, Wing Commander Knowles was back in the mess for what was described as a \"''convivial luncheon''\" with friends including Major Wait. Relaxing after [[luncheon]], news was received that an [[Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley]] had landed on the airfield, an unusual event which immediately aroused the interest of the C.O., who took his friends out onto the airfield to inspect the Whitley, which had called in to refuel before continuing on to a [[Coastal Command]] station in Scotland.<ref name=\"2ndww.blogspot.co.uk\"/> The [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley|Whitley]] MkV, BD417 belonged to [[No. 296 Squadron RAF|296 Squadron]].<ref name=\"2ndww.blogspot.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://coptercrazy.brinkster.net/CVT-wings/waryears/AW38-Page2600.html |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407231639/http://coptercrazy.brinkster.net/CVT-wings/waryears/AW38-Page2600.html |archive-date=7 April 2016 |title=AW-38 Production List |website=coptercrazy.brinkster.net |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/296squadron.cfm |title=296 Squadron |publisher=Royal Air Force |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThere was little else to do that summer's afternoon, and the Wing Commander decided to take the bomber up for a short flight.<ref name=\"2ndww.blogspot.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n[[File:Armstrong Whitworth Whitley in flight c1940.jpg|thumb|Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley.]]\n\nObjections from the Whitley pilot were overruled and the duty pilot of the day, [[Flying Officer]] A. B. Paton, was prevailed upon to join the C.O., his two friends, and Thelma Knowles, Wing Commander Knowles' wife. Four  corporals from the nearby crash section found themselves joining the party and acting as ballast in the back of the aircraft.\nWith engines started, the C.O. followed the perimeter track to the south end of the northeasterly facing runway.\n\nThe Whitley slowly gathered speed but the end of the runway was reached before it became airborne. It was then seen to be in trouble as it tried to gain height in order to clear the Bride Hills looming ahead. This it failed to do, and it crashed heavily into a field of West Kimmeragh, bursting into flames, and sending up a pall of smoke which could be seen for miles around.<ref name=\"2ndww.blogspot.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe rescue services went into immediate action but nothing could be done to save the four in the nose section of the aircraft; they all had been killed instantly.<ref name=\"2ndww.blogspot.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe rear section of the [[fuselage]] broke open and the four corporals were seen staggering around dazed with shock. They were taken by ambulance to the station hospital, but one was transferred to the [[Military Hospital]] which had been established at the Majestic Hotel in [[Onchan]]. Sadly though, Corporal Henderson never recovered from his severe head wounds.<ref name=\"2ndww.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nAn [[Air Ministry]] inquiry was ordered.\nThe five who perished in the disaster on that Sunday afternoon lie buried together in Andreas Churchyard.<ref name=\"Kniveton1985p60\">{{Harvnb|Kniveton|1985|p=60.}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|title= RAF Andreas\n|width=225 | height=170 | lines=3\n|align=centre\n|image:Plaque commemorating the donation of the organ to St Andrew's Church, Andreas.jpg|Plaque commemorating the donation of the organ blower to St Andrew's Church, Andreas.\n|image:St Andrew's Church, Andreas (15).jpg|The grave of Wing Commander Edward Vincent Knowles DFC.\n|image:St Andrew's Church, Andreas (16).jpg|The grave of Major Geoffrey Wait MC.\n|image:RAF Ensign in St Andrew's Church, Andreas.jpeg|RAF Ensign in St Andrew's Church, Andreas.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of former Royal Air Force stations]]\n* [[RAF Jurby]]\n* [[RAF Jurby Head]], an offshore bombing range\n* [[54 Air-Sea Rescue Marine Craft Unit RAF]]\n* [[HMS Valkyrie (shore establishment)|HMS ''Valkyrie'']]\n* [[HMS St George (shore establishment)|HMS ''St George'']]\n* [[HMS Urley]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Kniveton|1985}}|reference=Kniveton, G.
