However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site. This has, however, been met with complaints that bots remain and legitimate use is excessively interrupted.\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, Omegle began throwing jabs at the [[Communist Party of China]], and expressing support for the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|Liberation of Hong Kong]] during the 2019/20 protests, with an image on the front page saying \"[[Xi Jinping]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]) sure looks like [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z6mag.com/2019/10/10/omegle-throws-jabs-at-china-xi-pooh/|title=Omegle throws jabs at China: 'Xi = Pooh!'|last=Restar|first=Al|date=2019-10-10|website=Z6 Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funnyjunk.com/Omegle+is+supporting+hong+kong/giadMtv/|title=Omegle Is Supporting Hong Kong|website=funnyjunk.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nPrior to early 2013, the site did not [[Censorship|censor]] contributions through a [[profanity filter]], and users have reported encountering [[nudity]] or [[sexual content]] on camera.<ref name=\"bbctech\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> After January 2013, Omegle implemented a \"monitored\" video chat, to monitor misbehavior and protect people under the age of 18 from potentially harmful content, including nudity or sexual content.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd generation (2). They entered service in 1962. A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive until its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still retain \"operational status\" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. \n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. Therefore required building a large number of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html#class|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives - General Information - I|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n=== Production History ===\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|288x288px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with locomotive number 18040<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3571?list_type=preserved|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster National Railway Museum, Delhi (NRM) WDM-2 18040 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Images|first=Historical Railway|title=India Railways - Indian Government Railways Class WDM2 (DL560C) diesel locomotive Nr. 18041 (Alco 84199 / 1962)|date=2019-12-31|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/124446949@N06/49306888842/|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount.

Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C).A few WDM-2 locos had been rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) in Patiala, Punjab<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dmw.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/File/CompanyProfile_Eng%201.pdf|title=dmw works|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as Erode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as Ratlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 has a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locomotives can haul both vacuum and air brake wagons. Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locomotives from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locomotives proved to be not that useful as the locomotive pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbo locomotives were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locomotives can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/gallery/imagebank/Members/Shanx/ShanxMisc/018210_G_001.jpg.html|title=018210_G_001.jpg|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd generation (2). They entered service in 1962. A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive until its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still retain \"operational status\" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. \n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. Therefore required building a large number of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html#class|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives - General Information - I|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|288x288px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with locomotive number 18040<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3571?list_type=preserved|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster National Railway Museum, Delhi (NRM) WDM-2 18040 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Images|first=Historical Railway|title=India Railways - Indian Government Railways Class WDM2 (DL560C) diesel locomotive Nr. 18041 (Alco 84199 / 1962)|date=2019-12-31|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/124446949@N06/49306888842/|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> being the first WDM-2 of India.

The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as Erode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as Ratlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 has a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locomotives can haul both vacuum and air brake wagons. Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes.

But these locomotives proved to be not that useful as the locomotive pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbo locomotives were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows.

Except for some 150 units, the rest are actually rebuilt WDM-2.  Rebuilt WDM3As can be identified by a \u201cR\u201d at the end of their Road Number.\n\n=== WDG-2/3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDG-2/3A}}\n[[File:WDG-3A 13296.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|246x246px|The WDG-2/3A is the freight variant of WDM-2]]\nIt is the dedicated freight version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] and shares the same engine and horsepower rating with [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]].The first units of this class was delivered on July 18, 1995 under the name of WDG-2. The class was manufactured till end of 2015. All the older locomotives built by DLW had regular WDM-2 type square short hood profile and control stand position. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by High adhesion Fabricated bogies for better traction and Stability.\n\nThey are hugely successful with about 1163 units of this class have been produced.They can be found all over [[Indian Railways|India]] doing all kinds of duties like hauling freight and passenger service to [[Switcher|shunting]] and departmental works.\n\n=== WDM-7 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-7}}\n[[File:WDM7 BioDiesel.JPG|left|thumb|238x238px|A [[Indian locomotive class WDM-7|WDM-7]] can be recognized by lack of grilles on the short hood]]\nThey are lower powered('''2000 hp instead of 2600 hp)''' version of the WDM-2. These locos were built from 1987 to 1989. A few were at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] earlier but later all were transferred to [[Tondiarpet railway station|Tondiarpet]] seen shunting at Chennai Central or for light passenger haulage. Some are at the thermal power station, Chennai.\n\nThese Co-Co diesel-electrics were designed for branch-line duties (top speed 105 km/h). They have two 3-axle bogies and are similar to the WDM-2 in appearance. The power-pack is a 12-cylinder ALCO 251B unit. They were formerly housed at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]] and [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] also. They are reliable and rugged locomotives even though low powered. They can be easily recognized by the lack of grilles on the short hood. Two locos are running on a mixture of bio-diesel and diesel. All 15 are still in service.\n\n=== WDP-1 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDP-1}}\n[[File:Kakinada bound Seshadri Express at Samalkot Junction with WDP1 twin locomotives.jpg|left|thumb|248x248px|The WDP-1 has baldie grille-less short hood.]]\nIt is a lower powered passenger ('''2300 hp)''' version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]]. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by Bo-Bo fabricated bogies with a max. speed of 140 km/h. They were not hugely successful. About 69 units have been produced with 60 locos still being in service. They are easily identified by baldie grille-less short hood.\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n== Export versions ==\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\n[[File:SLR M8 Loco.jpg|thumb|292x292px|WDM-2 - Class M8 In Sri Lanka]]\n{{Main|Sri Lanka Railways M8}}\n\nEight WDM-2 locomotives were purchased by [[Sri Lanka Railways]], the state run railroad operator in [[Sri Lanka]] in 1996.

Whilst the school mainly admits boys, a small number girls have been educated at the school within the Sixth Form. The School holds specialist status in Sports.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sittingbourne Adult Education College - geograph.org.uk - 364022.jpg|thumb|left|The old Borden Grammar School now Sittingbourne Adult Education College]]\n\nPlans for a boys' school in [[Borden, Kent|Borden]] began in 1875, as a new way of using some of the accumulated funds from the Barrow Trust, established from the estate of William Barrow (d. 1707), a local farmer, for the benefit of the poorer inhabitants of the village. The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed \u00a39,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of [[Churcher's College]], and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish [[New College, Herne Bay]] in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to \"Borden Grammar School\", the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|George, Lord Harris]] in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an [[Adult Education]] Centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Bryan|title=Borden Grammar School \u2013 the early years part 1|url=http://old-bordenians.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/memory-lane/16-founding-a-school-in-the-1870s-part-i|website=The Old Bordenian Association|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the [[World War I|First World War]], most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.<ref>K.

Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the [[Alfred Rose (bishop)|Bishop of Dover]] as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe word \"Grammar\" was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word \"Grammar\" was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton|Robin, Lord Kingsdown]], the great-grandson of the School's first chair of governors, Sir [[Edward Leigh Pemberton]].<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref> One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir [[Stanley Hooker]], an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.\n\n== Modern School ==\nOn 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/about-us|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, three updated war memorials were installed in the School vestibule, commemorating all those Old Bordenians known to have given their lives in the conflicts of the Twentieth Century (forty casualties in the First World War, sixty casualties in the Second World War, and single casualties in the Boer War, Korean War and Northern Ireland).\n\nBorden became an [[academy]] in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Borden Grammar School, Sittingbourne|url=https://www.kent-teach.com/School/Directory/Details.aspx?SchoolId=2213|website=Kent-Teach|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, [[Fulston Manor School]] and [[Highsted Grammar School]] for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and [[Psychology]].\n\n== Old Bordenian Association ==\nThe Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, ''The Maroon'', was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.\n\n== School badge, motto and song ==\nThe School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as \"azure, a chevron between three crescents or\",  is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out.\n\nThe School has a Latin motto, ''nitere porro'', which translates as \"to strive forward\". Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by [[Julius Caesar]] quoted in [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]. \n\n'[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'\n\n== Houses ==\nIn common with many [[secondary school]]s in England, Borden has long had a [[house system]]. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]], the [[etymology]] of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, [[The Swale]], which runs between [[Sittingbourne]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and also lends its name to the local [[Borough]] Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are [[Lords cricket ground|Lord's]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon]], [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], named after the homes of [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Information|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015|quote=Lords, Twickenham, Wembley and Wimbledon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131553/http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nThere is no uniform, students attend in the nude.\n\n== Cadet Corps ==\nThe School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, [[The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th [[The Buffs (East Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7y__ACbNigC&pg=PA122&dq=borden+school+cadet+corps#v=onepage&q=borden%20school%20cadet%20corps&f=false | title=Tracing the Rifle Volunteers: A Guide for Military and Family Historians| isbn=9781848842113| last1=Westlake| first1=Ray| date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n* 1878\u20131893: Rev.

The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed \u00a39,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of [[Churcher's College]], and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish [[New College, Herne Bay]] in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to \"Borden Grammar School\", the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|George, Lord Harris]] in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an [[Adult Education]] Centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Bryan|title=Borden Grammar School \u2013 the early years part 1|url=http://old-bordenians.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/memory-lane/16-founding-a-school-in-the-1870s-part-i|website=The Old Bordenian Association|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the [[World War I|First World War]], most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p.5</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, the Government announced that a number of towns on the Southeast Coast were to have their children [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]]: [[Sheerness]] was one such town, and some sixty-five pupils from Borden, accompanied by three masters, were evacuated to [[Pengam]], South Wales, where the boys were to attend the [[Lewis School, Pengam|Lewis School]]. Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the [[Alfred Rose (bishop)|Bishop of Dover]] as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe word \"Grammar\" was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word \"Grammar\" was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton|Robin, Lord Kingsdown]], the great-grandson of the School's first chair of governors, Sir [[Edward Leigh Pemberton]].<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref> One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir [[Stanley Hooker]], an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.\n\n== Modern School ==\nOn 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/about-us|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, three updated war memorials were installed in the School vestibule, commemorating all those Old Bordenians known to have given their lives in the conflicts of the Twentieth Century (forty casualties in the First World War, sixty casualties in the Second World War, and single casualties in the Boer War, Korean War and Northern Ireland).\n\nBorden became an [[academy]] in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Borden Grammar School, Sittingbourne|url=https://www.kent-teach.com/School/Directory/Details.aspx?SchoolId=2213|website=Kent-Teach|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, [[Fulston Manor School]] and [[Highsted Grammar School]] for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and [[Psychology]].\n\n== Old Bordenian Association ==\nThe Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, ''The Maroon'', was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.\n\n== School badge, motto and song ==\nThe School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as \"azure, a chevron between three crescents or\",  is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out.\n\nThe School has a Latin motto, ''nitere porro'', which translates as \"to strive forward\". Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by [[Julius Caesar]] quoted in [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]. \n\n'[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'\n\n== Houses ==\nIn common with many [[secondary school]]s in England, Borden has long had a [[house system]]. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]], the [[etymology]] of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, [[The Swale]], which runs between [[Sittingbourne]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and also lends its name to the local [[Borough]] Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are [[Lords cricket ground|Lord's]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon]], [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], named after the homes of [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Information|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015|quote=Lords, Twickenham, Wembley and Wimbledon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131553/http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nThere is no uniform, students attend in the nude.\n\n== Cadet Corps ==\nThe School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, [[The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th [[The Buffs (East Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7y__ACbNigC&pg=PA122&dq=borden+school+cadet+corps#v=onepage&q=borden%20school%20cadet%20corps&f=false | title=Tracing the Rifle Volunteers: A Guide for Military and Family Historians| isbn=9781848842113| last1=Westlake| first1=Ray| date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n* 1878\u20131893: Rev.
