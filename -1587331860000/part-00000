[[Situationist International]] proposes that leisure does not evolve from free time, and free-time is an illusory concept that is rarely fully \"free\"; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as \"leisure\".<ref>''Situationist International #9'' (1964) \"Questionnaire, section 12\"</ref> Certainly most people's leisure activities are not a completely free choice and may be constrained by social pressures, e.g. people may be coerced into spending time gardening by the need to keep up with the standard of neighbouring gardens or go to a party because of social pressures.\n\n'''Leisure as experience''' usually emphasizes dimensions of perceived freedom and choice. It is done for \"its own sake\", for the quality of experience and involvement.<ref name=\"Kelly 1996 17\u201327\"/> Other classic definitions include [[Thorsten Veblen|Thorsten Veblen's]] (1899) of \"nonproductive consumption of time.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Theory of the Leisure Class|last = Veblen|first = Thorsten|publisher = New American Library|year = 1953|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 46}}</ref> Different disciplines have definitions reflecting their common issues: for example, sociology on social forces and contexts and psychology as mental and emotional states and conditions.

Economists consider that leisure times are valuable to a person like wages that they could earn for the same time spend towards the activity.

Another related concept is that of family leisure. Relationships with others is usually a major factor in both satisfaction and choice.\n\nThe concept of [[Right to leisure|leisure as a human right]] was realised in article 24 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].\n\nLeisure a time that it takes anyone names Ryan to do anything.\n\n== History of leisure ==\nLeisure has historically been the privilege of the [[Upper class]].<ref>Peter N. Stearns, ed., ''Encyclopedia of European social history from 1350 to 2000'' (2001) 5:3-261.</ref> Opportunities for leisure came with more money, or organization, and less working time, rising dramatically in the mid-to-late 19th century, starting in Great Britain and spreading to other rich nations in Europe. It spread as well to the United States, although that country had a reputation in Europe for providing much less leisure despite its wealth.  Immigrants to the United States discovered they had to work harder than they did in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Wyman|title=Round-trip to America: The Immigrants Return to Europe, 1880-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJOh-Yt4PdkC&pg=PA53|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=53|isbn=978-0801481123}}</ref> Economists continue to investigate why Americans work longer hours.<ref>Edward C.

In a cold country with winter's long nights, and summer's extended daylight, favorite leisure activities include horse racing, team sports such as hockey, singalongs, roller skating and board games.<ref>Suzanne Morton, \"Leisure,\" ''Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2006) pp 355-56.</ref><ref>George Karlis, ''Leisure and recreation in Canadian society: An introduction'' (2011).</ref><ref>Gerald Redmond, \"Some Aspects of Organized Sport and Leisure in Nineteenth-Century Canada.\" ''Loisir et soci\u00e9t\u00e9/Society and Leisure'' 2#1 (1979): 71-100.</ref>  The churches tried to steer leisure activities, by preaching against drinking and scheduling annual revivals and weekly club activities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynne Sorrel Marks|title=Revivals and Roller Rinks: Religion, Leisure, and Identity in Late-nineteenth-century Small-town Ontario|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2T4miKwsIIcC&pg=PR1|year=1996|isbn=9780802078001}}</ref>  By 1930 radio played a major role in uniting Canadians behind their local or regional hockey teams.

It was increasingly organized. In the French industrial city of [[Lille]], with a population of 80,000 in 1858, the cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1300, or one for every three houses. Lille counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations.  Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets, festivals and competitions.<ref>Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848-1945, vol. 2, Intellect, Taste and Anxiety'' (1977) pp 2:270-71.</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n[[File:DV257 no.10 The start.png|thumb|A caricature of upper class Victorian tourists, 1852]]\nAs literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the mid-19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.<ref name=\"Peter J. Beck 2008\">Peter J. Beck, \"Leisure and Sport in Britain.\" in Chris Wrigley, ed., ''A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain'' (2008): 453-69.</ref>\n\nOpportunities for leisure activities increased because real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban Britain, the nine-hour day was increasingly the norm; 1874 factory act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours. The movement toward an eight-hour day. Furthermore, system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class.<ref>[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: Peace and War, 1886-1918'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), 529-70.</ref><ref>Hugh Cunningham, ''Time, work and leisure: Life changes in England since 1700'' (2014)</ref> Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays.<ref>John K. Walton, ''The English seaside resort. A social history 1750-1914'' (1983).</ref>\n\nBy the late [[Victorian era]], the leisure industry had emerged in all British cities, and the pattern was copied across Western Europe and North America. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length and convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These include sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. By 1880 football was no longer the preserve of the social elite, as it attracted large working-class audiences. Average gate was 5,000 in 1905, rising to 23,000 in 1913. That amounted to 6 million paying customers with a weekly turnover of \u00a3400,000. Sports by 1900 generated some three percent of the total gross national product in Britain. Professionalization of sports was the norm, although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience, such as lawn tennis and golf. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics.<ref>Searle, ''A New England?'' pp 547-53</ref>\n\nLeisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs.<ref>Peter Haydon, ''The English pub: a history'' (1994).</ref> Heavy drinking declined; there was more betting on outcomes. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for average English people, and their interest in spectator sports increased dramatically.<ref>John K. Walton, ''Leisure in Britain, 1780-1939'' (1983).</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages, and genders in very large numbers. Giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars 1918-1940'' (1955) pp 246-50</ref>\n\nThe British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, that any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play.<ref name=\"Peter J. Beck 2008\"/>  Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Soccer proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing.  New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones.  The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.<ref>Derek Birley, ''Land of sport and glory: Sport and British society, 1887-1910'' (1995)</ref>\n\n[[Cricket]] had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, And was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = David | year = 1999 | title = Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860-1960 | url = | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 51\u201381 }}</ref>  Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the most famous is that between Australia and Britain for \"[[The Ashes]].\"<ref>Derek Birley, ''A Social History of English Cricket'' (1999) [https://www.amazon.com/Social-History-English-Cricket-Classics/dp/1781311765/  excerpt]</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nThe range of leisure activities extends from the very informal and casual to highly organised and long-lasting activities.  A significant subset of leisure activities are [[Hobby|hobbies]] which are undertaken for personal satisfaction, usually on a regular basis, and often result in satisfaction through skill development or recognised achievement, sometimes in the form of a product. The [[list of hobbies]] is ever changing as society changes.\n\n=== Serious leisure ===\n\nSubstantial and fulfilling hobbies and pursuits are described by Stebbins<ref name=\":0\" /> as ''serious leisure''. The ''Serious Leisure Perspective'' is a way of viewing the wide range of leisure pursuits in three main categories: casual leisure, serious leisure, and project-based Leisure.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|url = http://www.seriousleisure.net/concepts.html|website = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|access-date = 18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n\"''Serious leisure'' is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer ... that is highly substantial, interesting, and fulfilling and where ... participants find a [leisure] career...\".<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, collecting stamps or maintaining a public wetland area.\n\nPeople undertaking serious leisure can be categorised as [[amateur]]s, [[Volunteering|volunteers]] or [[hobby]]ists.

The Internet is providing increased support for amateurs and hobbyists to communicate, display and share products.\n\n==== Reading ====\n\nAs literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year  by 1935. Libraries tripled their stocks, and saw heavy demand for new fiction.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Basil Cottle | last1 = Cottle | first1 = Basil | year = 1978 | title = Popular Reading And Our Public Libraries: The Abjured Prescription | url = | journal = Library Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 222\u2013227 | doi=10.1108/eb012677}}</ref> A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by [[Allen Lane]] (1902\u201370) at [[Penguin Books]] in 1935.  The first titles included novels  by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's.   Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downscale image of American paperbacks. The line signaled cultural self-improvement and political education. The more polemical Penguin Specials, typically with a leftist orientation for Labour readers, were widely distributed during World War II.<ref>Nicholas Joicey, \"A Paperback Guide to Progress: Penguin Books 1935\u2013c. 1951.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 4#1 (1993): 25-56.

[[Situationist International]] proposes that leisure does not evolve from free time, and free-time is an illusory concept that is rarely fully \"free\"; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as \"leisure\".<ref>''Situationist International #9'' (1964) \"Questionnaire, section 12\"</ref> Certainly most people's leisure activities are not a completely free choice and may be constrained by social pressures, e.g. people may be coerced into spending time gardening by the need to keep up with the standard of neighbouring gardens or go to a party because of social pressures.\n\n'''Leisure as experience''' usually emphasizes dimensions of perceived freedom and choice.

Another related concept is that of family leisure. Relationships with others is usually a major factor in both satisfaction and choice.\n\nThe concept of [[Right to leisure|leisure as a human right]] was realised in article 24 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].\n\n== History of leisure ==\nLeisure has historically been the privilege of the [[Upper class]].<ref>Peter N. Stearns, ed., ''Encyclopedia of European social history from 1350 to 2000'' (2001) 5:3-261.</ref> Opportunities for leisure came with more money, or organization, and less working time, rising dramatically in the mid-to-late 19th century, starting in Great Britain and spreading to other rich nations in Europe. It spread as well to the United States, although that country had a reputation in Europe for providing much less leisure despite its wealth.  Immigrants to the United States discovered they had to work harder than they did in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Wyman|title=Round-trip to America: The Immigrants Return to Europe, 1880-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJOh-Yt4PdkC&pg=PA53|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=53|isbn=978-0801481123}}</ref> Economists continue to investigate why Americans work longer hours.<ref>Edward C.

Paris, Gallimard, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, leisure in the country is related to the decline in work hours and is shaped by moral values, and the ethnic-religious and gender communities. In a cold country with winter's long nights, and summer's extended daylight, favorite leisure activities include horse racing, team sports such as hockey, singalongs, roller skating and board games.<ref>Suzanne Morton, \"Leisure,\" ''Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2006) pp 355-56.</ref><ref>George Karlis, ''Leisure and recreation in Canadian society: An introduction'' (2011).</ref><ref>Gerald Redmond, \"Some Aspects of Organized Sport and Leisure in Nineteenth-Century Canada.\" ''Loisir et soci\u00e9t\u00e9/Society and Leisure'' 2#1 (1979): 71-100.</ref>  The churches tried to steer leisure activities, by preaching against drinking and scheduling annual revivals and weekly club activities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynne Sorrel Marks|title=Revivals and Roller Rinks: Religion, Leisure, and Identity in Late-nineteenth-century Small-town Ontario|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2T4miKwsIIcC&pg=PR1|year=1996|isbn=9780802078001}}</ref>  By 1930 radio played a major role in uniting Canadians behind their local or regional hockey teams.

It was increasingly organized. In the French industrial city of [[Lille]], with a population of 80,000 in 1858, the cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1300, or one for every three houses. Lille counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations.  Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets, festivals and competitions.<ref>Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848-1945, vol. 2, Intellect, Taste and Anxiety'' (1977) pp 2:270-71.</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n[[File:DV257 no.10 The start.png|thumb|A caricature of upper class Victorian tourists, 1852]]\nAs literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the mid-19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.<ref name=\"Peter J. Beck 2008\">Peter J. Beck, \"Leisure and Sport in Britain.\" in Chris Wrigley, ed., ''A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain'' (2008): 453-69.</ref>\n\nOpportunities for leisure activities increased because real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban Britain, the nine-hour day was increasingly the norm; 1874 factory act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours. The movement toward an eight-hour day. Furthermore, system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class.<ref>[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: Peace and War, 1886-1918'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), 529-70.</ref><ref>Hugh Cunningham, ''Time, work and leisure: Life changes in England since 1700'' (2014)</ref> Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays.<ref>John K. Walton, ''The English seaside resort. A social history 1750-1914'' (1983).</ref>\n\nBy the late [[Victorian era]], the leisure industry had emerged in all British cities, and the pattern was copied across Western Europe and North America. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length and convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These include sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. By 1880 football was no longer the preserve of the social elite, as it attracted large working-class audiences. Average gate was 5,000 in 1905, rising to 23,000 in 1913. That amounted to 6 million paying customers with a weekly turnover of \u00a3400,000. Sports by 1900 generated some three percent of the total gross national product in Britain. Professionalization of sports was the norm, although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience, such as lawn tennis and golf. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics.<ref>Searle, ''A New England?'' pp 547-53</ref>\n\nLeisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs.<ref>Peter Haydon, ''The English pub: a history'' (1994).</ref> Heavy drinking declined; there was more betting on outcomes. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for average English people, and their interest in spectator sports increased dramatically.<ref>John K. Walton, ''Leisure in Britain, 1780-1939'' (1983).</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages, and genders in very large numbers. Giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars 1918-1940'' (1955) pp 246-50</ref>\n\nThe British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, that any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play.<ref name=\"Peter J. Beck 2008\"/>  Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Soccer proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing.  New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones.  The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.<ref>Derek Birley, ''Land of sport and glory: Sport and British society, 1887-1910'' (1995)</ref>\n\n[[Cricket]] had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, And was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = David | year = 1999 | title = Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860-1960 | url = | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 51\u201381 }}</ref>  Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the most famous is that between Australia and Britain for \"[[The Ashes]].\"<ref>Derek Birley, ''A Social History of English Cricket'' (1999) [https://www.amazon.com/Social-History-English-Cricket-Classics/dp/1781311765/  excerpt]</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nThe range of leisure activities extends from the very informal and casual to highly organised and long-lasting activities.  A significant subset of leisure activities are [[Hobby|hobbies]] which are undertaken for personal satisfaction, usually on a regular basis, and often result in satisfaction through skill development or recognised achievement, sometimes in the form of a product. The [[list of hobbies]] is ever changing as society changes.\n\n=== Serious leisure ===\n\nSubstantial and fulfilling hobbies and pursuits are described by Stebbins<ref name=\":0\" /> as ''serious leisure''. The ''Serious Leisure Perspective'' is a way of viewing the wide range of leisure pursuits in three main categories: casual leisure, serious leisure, and project-based Leisure.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|url = http://www.seriousleisure.net/concepts.html|website = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|access-date = 18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n\"''Serious leisure'' is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer ... that is highly substantial, interesting, and fulfilling and where ... participants find a [leisure] career...\".<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, collecting stamps or maintaining a public wetland area.\n\nPeople undertaking serious leisure can be categorised as [[amateur]]s, [[Volunteering|volunteers]] or [[hobby]]ists.

The Internet is providing increased support for amateurs and hobbyists to communicate, display and share products.\n\n==== Reading ====\n\nAs literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year  by 1935. Libraries tripled their stocks, and saw heavy demand for new fiction.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Basil Cottle | last1 = Cottle | first1 = Basil | year = 1978 | title = Popular Reading And Our Public Libraries: The Abjured Prescription | url = | journal = Library Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 222\u2013227 | doi=10.1108/eb012677}}</ref> A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by [[Allen Lane]] (1902\u201370) at [[Penguin Books]] in 1935.  The first titles included novels  by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's.   Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downscale image of American paperbacks. The line signaled cultural self-improvement and political education. The more polemical Penguin Specials, typically with a leftist orientation for Labour readers, were widely distributed during World War II.<ref>Nicholas Joicey, \"A Paperback Guide to Progress: Penguin Books 1935\u2013c. 1951.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 4#1 (1993): 25-56.

The story line in magazines and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were perceived as exciting and just.<ref>Ernest Sackville Turner, ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.''

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]],'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]], and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kyiv Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

By age fifteen, Stravinsky had mastered [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] and finished a piano reduction of a string quartet by [[Alexander Glazunov]], who reportedly considered Stravinsky unmusical and thought little of his skills.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=564}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov and first compositions, 1901\u20131909===\n[[File:Stravinsky Igor Postcard-1910.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Stravinsky in 1903]]\nDespite Stravinsky's enthusiasm and ability in music, his parents expected him to study law and, at first, he took to the subject. In 1901, he enrolled at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] studying criminal law and legal philosophy, but attendance at lectures was optional and he estimated that he turned up to fewer than fifty in his four years of study.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=565}} In the summer of 1902, Stravinsky stayed with composer and orchestrator [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and his family in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, after he had met Vladimir, the youngest son of Rimsky-Korsakov and a fellow pupil at the University of Saint Petersburg, and wished to meet his father about his musical aspirations. Rimsky-Korsakov, arguably the leading Russian composer at this time, suggested to Stravinsky that he should not enter the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] but continue private lessons in theory.{{sfn|White|1979|p=8}}\n\nBy the time of his father's death from cancer in 1902, Stravinsky was spending more time studying music than law.{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} His decision to pursue music full time was helped when the university was closed for two months in 1905 in the aftermath of [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], which prevented him from taking his final law exams.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France. In September, they moved to [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]], Switzerland where their second son, [[Soulima Stravinsky|Sviatoslav]] (Soulima), was born.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=145}} The family would spend their summers in Russia and winters in Switzerland until 1914.{{sfn|White|1979|p=33}} Diaghilev commissioned Stravinsky to score a second ballet for the 1911 Paris season. The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=100, 102}} For the rest of the summer he focused on his first opera, ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (''Le Rossignol''), based on the [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|same-titled story]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], which he had started in 1908.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=111\u201314}} On 15 January 1914, Stravinsky and Nosenko had their fourth child, Marie Mil\u00e8ne (or Maria Milena). After her delivery, Nosenko was discovered to have [[tuberculosis]] and was confined to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Leysin]] in the Alps. Stravinsky took up residence nearby, where he completed ''The Nightingale''.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=224}}{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|p=119}} The work premiered in Paris in May 1914, after the Moscow Free Theatre had commissioned the piece for 10,000 rubles but soon became bankrupt.

Koussevitzky asked for Stravinsky to compose a new piece for one of his upcoming concerts; Stravinsky agreed to a piano concerto, to which Koussevitzky convinced him that he be the soloist at its premiere. Stravinsky agreed, and the ''[[Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments (Stravinsky)|Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments]]'' was first performed in May 1924.{{sfn|White|1979|pp=65\u201366}} The piece was a success, and Stravinsky secured himself the rights to exclusively perform the work for the next five years.{{sfn|White|1979|p=67}} Following a European tour through the latter half of 1924, Stravinsky completed his first US tour in early 1925 which spanned two months.{{sfn|White|1979|p=67}}\n\nIn May 1927, Stravinsky's opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' premiered in Paris.

For a while, he maintained a circle of contacts and [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] friends from Russia, but he eventually found that this did not sustain his intellectual and professional life. He was drawn to the growing cultural life of Los Angeles, especially during World War II, when so many writers, musicians, composers and conductors settled in the area: these included [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[George Balanchine]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. [[Bernard Holland]] claimed Stravinsky was especially fond of British writers, who visited him in Beverly Hills, \"like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Dylan Thomas]]. They shared the composer's taste for hard spirits \u2013 especially [[Aldous Huxley]], with whom Stravinsky spoke in French.\"{{sfn|Holland|2001}} Stravinsky and Huxley had a tradition of Saturday lunches for west coast avant-garde and luminaries.{{sfn|Anonymous|2010}}\n\nStravinsky's unconventional [[dominant seventh chord]] in his arrangement of the \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner|Star-Spangled Banner]]\" led to an incident with the Boston police on 15 January 1944, and he was warned that the authorities could impose a $100 fine upon any \"re-arrangement of the national anthem in whole or in part\".<ref>According to Michael Steinberg's liner notes to ''Stravinsky in America'', RCA 09026-68865-2, p.&nbsp;7, the police \"removed the parts from Symphony Hall\", quoted in Thom 2007, p.&nbsp;50.</ref> The police, as it turned out, were wrong.

It marked his first piece that was premiered in the US.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=188}} In 1947, Stravinsky was inspired to write his English-language opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' from visiting an exhibition of the [[A Rake's Progress|same-titled series of paintings]] by cartoonist [[William Hogarth]] in Chicago. Hogarth's drawings, which told the story of a London man who lost his money and became a drunk, was an idea Stravinsky found attractive as an opera. American poet [[W. H.

It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

Earlier writers, such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Elliott Carter]], and [[Boris de Schl\u00f6zer|Boris de Schloezer]] held somewhat unfavorable views of Stravinsky's works, and [[Virgil Thomson]], writing in ''Modern Music'' (a quarterly review published between 1925 and 1946), could find only a common \"'seriousness' of 'tone' or of 'purpose', 'the exact correlation between the goal and the means', or a dry 'ant-like neatness'\".{{sfn|Pasler|1983|p=608}}\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1910, [[Florent Schmitt]] dedicated the revised version of his ballet ''La trag\u00e9die de Salom\u00e9'', Op. 50, to Stravinsky.{{sfn|Pasler and Rife|2001}}\n\nIn 1915, [[Claude Debussy]] dedicated the third movement of his ''[[En blanc et noir]]'' for two pianos to Stravinsky.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Laki\n| first = Peter\n| url = https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/composition/5401\n| title = En Blanc et Noir / About the Work\n| website = [[Kennedy Center]]\n| date =\n| accessdate = 7 November 2019\n}}</ref> \n\nIn 1982, Stravinsky was featured on a 2\u00a2 postage stamp by the [[United States Postal Service]] as part of its [[Great Americans series|Great Americans stamp series]].\n\n===Awards===\n\n* 1954: [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] Gold Medal\n* 1959: [[L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize]]\n* 1963: [[Wihuri Sibelius Prize]]\n* [[Grammy Award]]s\n** 1962: [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition|Best Classical Composition by Contemporary Composer]] (''[[The Flood (Stravinsky)|The Flood]]'')<ref name=\"1962 Grammy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0150544.html |title=1962 Grammy Awards|date=5 March 2012|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref>\n** 1962: [[Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance|Best Classical Performance \u2013 Orchestra]] (''[[The Firebird]]'', Igor Stravinsky conducting [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra]])<ref name=\"1962 Grammy\" />\n** 1962: [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra)|Best Classical Performance \u2013 Instrumental Soloist (with orchestra)]] ([[Violin Concerto (Stravinsky)|Violin Concerto in D]], [[Isaac Stern]]; Igor Stravinsky conducting Columbia Symphony Orchestra)<ref name=\"1962 Grammy\" />\n** 1987: [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement]] (posthumous)\n\n=== Orders ===\n\n*[[File:PRT_Order_of_Saint_James_of_the_Sword_-_Commander_BAR.png|80px]] Commander of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]], Portugal (25 July 1966)<ref name=\"OrdHonPor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ordens.presidencia.pt/?idc=154|title=Cidad\u00e3os Estrangeiros Agraciados com Ordens Portuguesas|website=P\u00e1gina Oficial das Ordens Honor\u00edficas Portuguesas|accessdate=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings and publications==\n{{Further |Igor Stravinsky discography}}\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Igor Stravinsky - 3 Pieces for Clarinet Alone.ogg|title=3 Pieces for Clarinet Alone|description=}}\nIgor Stravinsky found recordings a practical and useful tool in preserving his thoughts on the interpretation of his music.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]],'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]], and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V.

The ''[[Concerto in D (Stravinsky)|Concerto in D]]'' premiered in 1947.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=185, 190}} In January 1946, Stravinsky conducted the premiere of his ''[[Symphony in Three Movements]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City. It marked his first piece that was premiered in the US.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=188}} In 1947, Stravinsky was inspired to write his English-language opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' from visiting an exhibition of the [[A Rake's Progress|same-titled series of paintings]] by cartoonist [[William Hogarth]] in Chicago. Hogarth's drawings, which told the story of a London man who lost his money and became a drunk, was an idea Stravinsky found attractive as an opera. American poet [[W. H. Auden]] and writer [[Chester Kallman]] worked on the libretto. The opera premiered in 1951 and marks the final work during Stravinsky's neoclassical period.{{sfn|Whiting|2005|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nStravinsky befriended American conductor [[Robert Craft]] while composing ''The Rake's Progress''.

His case of [[polycythemia]] had worsened and his friends had noticed that his movements and speech had slowed.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=488}} In 1965, Stravinsky agreed to have [[David Oppenheim (clarinetist)|David Oppenheim]] produce a documentary film about himself for the [[CBS]] network. It involved a film crew following the composer at home and on tour that year, paying him $10,000 for the production.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=501}} The documentary includes Stravinsky's visit to Les Tilleuls, the house in Clarens, Switzerland, where he wrote the majority of ''The Rite of Spring''. The crew asked Soviet authorities to film Stravinsky returning to his hometown of Ustilug, but the request was denied.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|pp=503\u2013504}} In 1966, Stravinsky completed his last major work, the ''[[Requiem Canticles]]''.{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=41}}\n\nIn February 1967, Stravinsky and Craft directed their own concert in Miami, Florida, which marked the composer's first in the state. By this time, Stravinsky's typical performance fee had amounted to $10,000. Then, upon doctor's orders, his subsequent bookings that required him to fly were cancelled.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=528}} An exception to this was a concert at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, Canada in May 1967, where he conducted the less physically demanding ''Pulcinella'' suite with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]]. He had become increasingly frail and for the only time in his career, Stravinsky conducted while sitting down. It was his final performance as conductor in his lifetime.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=529}} While backstage at the venue, Stravinsky informed to Craft that he believed to have suffered from a stroke.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=528}} In August 1967, Stravinsky was hospitalised in Hollywood for bleeding stomach ulcers and thrombosis which required a blood transfusion. In his diary, Craft wrote that he spoon fed the ailing composer and held his hand: \"He says the warmth diminishes the pain.\"{{sfn|White|1979|p=154}}\n\nBy 1968, Stravinsky had recovered enough to resume touring across the US with him in the audience while Craft took to the conductor's post for the majority of the concerts.{{sfn|White|1979|p=155}} In May 1968, Stravinsky completed the piano arrangement of two songs by Austrian composer [[Hugo Wolf]] for a small orchestra.{{sfn|White|1979|p=155}} In October Stravinsky, Vera, and Craft travelled to Zurich, Switzerland to sort business matters with Stravinsky's family. While there, Stravinsky's son Theodore handed the manuscript of ''The Rite of Spring'' where Stravinsky signed it and gave it to Vera.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|pp=542\u2013543}} The three considered relocating to Switzerland as they had become increasingly less fond of Hollywood, but they decided against it and returned to the US.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=544}}\n\n====Final years and death====\n[[File:Stravinskygrave.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky's grave on [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele Island]]]]\nIn October 1969, after close to three decades in California and being denied to travel overseas by his doctors due to ill health, Stravinsky and Vera secured a two-year lease for a luxury three bedroom apartment in [[Jumeirah Essex House|Essex House]] in New York City.

His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world's major cities, including Paris, Venice, Berlin, London, [[Amsterdam]] and New York and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as [[Coco Chanel]]. He never referred to it himself, but Chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer [[Paul Morand]] in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later.{{sfn|Morand|1976|pp=121\u201324}} The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky's widow, Vera, and by Craft.{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=439}} Chanel's fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/Fact_or_fiction-Chanel_Stravinsky-affair-curtains-Cannes--_52910.html Fact-or-fiction Chanel-Stravinsky affair curtains Cannes].

Baptized at birth, he later rebelled against the Church and abandoned it by the time he was fourteen or fifteen years old.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1969|p=198}} Throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from Christianity and it was not until he reached his early forties that he experienced a spiritual crisis. After befriending a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Nicholas, after his move to [[Nice]] in 1924, he reconnected with his faith. He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|p=51}} Robert Craft noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1966|pp=172\u201375}} Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services. In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:<blockquote>I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief. I was not reasoned into my disposition. Though I admire the structured thought of theology ([[St Anselm|Anselm]]'s proof in the ''[[Fides quaerens intellectum|Fides Quaerens Intellectum]]'', for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music. I do not believe in bridges of reason or, indeed, in any form of extrapolation in religious matters. ...

In 1923, [[Erik Satie]] wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.{{sfn|Satie|1923}} Satie had met Stravinsky for the first time in 1910. In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers. That was exactly what [[Jean Cocteau]] did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, {{lang|fr|Le Coq et l'Arlequin}}.{{sfn|Volta|1989|loc=first pages of chapter on contemporaries}}{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1923:\n<blockquote>All the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentricity that was one of the legacies of the war....

Bach]], conceding that, \"there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky. It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

The tour took place between January 12 and 22, 2018, with shows taking place in [[Nagoya]], [[Kyoto]], [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], [[Osaka]], [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]] and [[Tokyo]], Japan. The 2018 tour was the eight time that NJPW and CMLL co-promoted shows in Japan under the ''[[Fantastica Mania]]'' name. With eight shows, the 2018 tour was the longest in ''Fantastica Mania'' history. The shows geneally featured seven matches each night, with several shows being shown at least in part on SamuraiTV, and the last three shows were shown in full as part of the [[NJPW World]] streaming content.\n\nThe eight shows featured a total of 66 matches, four of which for CMLL championships including [[Soberano Jr.]], [[Niebla Roja]] and [[Volador Jr.]] successfully defending their championships, and [[El Cuatrero]] defeating [[\u00c1ngel de Oro]] to win the [[CMLL World Middleweight Championship]]. The focal point of the last two show was the \"CMLL Brothers tag team tournament, won by [[Gran Guerrero]] and [[\u00daltimo Guerrero]], that also included El Cuatrero/[[Sans\u00f3n (wrestler)|Sans\u00f3n]], \u00c1ngel de Oro/Niebla Roja, and [[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]]/[[M\u00edstico II|M\u00edstico]].\n\n==Background==\nThe 2018 ''[[Fantastica Mania]]'' tour was the eight year in a row where Japanese wrestling promotion [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) promoted a series of shows with their Mexican partner promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL). Due to the co-promotional nature of the shows, they rarely feature any development in ongoing NJPW or CMLL storylines, instead of focusing on inter-promotional matches.

Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] and the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion. The tour took place between January 12 and 22, 2018, with shows taking place in [[Nagoya]], [[Kyoto]], [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], [[Osaka]], [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]] and [[Tokyo]], Japan. The 2018 tour was the eight time that NJPW and CMLL co-promoted shows in Japan under the ''[[Fantastica Mania]]'' name. With eight shows, the 2018 tour was the longest in ''Fantastica Mania'' history. The shows geneally featured seven matches each night, with several shows being shown at least in part on SamuraiTV, and the last three shows were shown in full as part of the [[NJPW World]] streaming content.\n\nThe eight shows featured a total of 66 matches, four of which for CMLL championships including [[Soberano Jr.]], [[Niebla Roja]] and [[Volador Jr.]] successfully defending their championships, and [[El Cuatrero]] defeating [[\u00c1ngel de Oro]] to win the [[CMLL World Middleweight Championship]]. The focal point of the last two show was the \"CMLL Brothers tag team tournament, won by [[Gran Guerrero]] and [[\u00daltimo Guerrero]], that also included El Cuatrero/[[Sans\u00f3n (wrestler)|Sans\u00f3n]], \u00c1ngel de Oro/Niebla Roja, and [[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]]/[[M\u00edstico II|M\u00edstico]].\n\n==Background==\nThe 2018 ''[[Fantastica Mania]]'' tour was the eight year in a row where Japanese wrestling promotion [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) promoted a series of shows with their Mexican partner promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL). Due to the co-promotional nature of the shows, they rarely feature any development in ongoing NJPW or CMLL storylines, instead of focusing on inter-promotional matches. [[Negro Casas]] had originally been announced as a participant, but he was injured during a match against [[Sam Adonis]] as CMLLs [[Sin Piedad (2018)|Sin Piedad]] event on January 1.<ref

This has displaced thousands of poor families who owned their Bajaaj for basic livelihood, education for their children, and support extended to families. These families worked twenty-four hours a day...families with three to four adults, including women, who take shifts to meet their basic needs. Now, similar to what the New York City taxi service offered prior to Uber and Lyft, where drivers had to drive eight hours to pay the daily fee for renting a taxi, Hormuud charges these families about 1/3 of their daily income to drive their Bajaajs.

''Doctor Zhivago'' was rejected for publication in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], but the manuscript was smuggled to Italy for publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-declassifies-agency-role-in-publishing-doctor-zhivago.html|title=CIA Declassifies Agency Role in Publishing Doctor Zhivago \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958, an event that enraged the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were able to accept it in his name in 1988.

His mother was [[Rosa Kaufman]], a concert pianist and the daughter of [[Odessa]] industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife. Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters [[Lydia Pasternak Slater|Lydia]] and Josephine. The family claimed to be descended on the paternal line from [[Isaac Abarbanel]], the famous 15th-century [[Sephardic Jewish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Rabbinic commentaries|Bible commentator]], and treasurer of [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher Barnes|author2=Christopher J.

Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, L'wow) to study history and philosophy. The good dimension of the character Strelnikov in Dr. Zhivago is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia.\n\nIn a 1959 letter to Jacqueline de Proyart, Pasternak recalled,\n\n{{quote|I was baptized as a child by my [[nanny]], but because of the restrictions imposed on Jews, particularly in the case of a family which was exempt from them and enjoyed a certain reputation in view of my father's standing as an artist, there was something a little complicated about this, and it was always felt to be half-secret and intimate, a source of rare and exceptional inspiration rather than being calmly taken for granted. I believe that this is at the root of my distinctiveness. Most intensely of all my mind was occupied by Christianity in the years 1910\u201312, when the main foundations of this distinctiveness \u2013 my way of seeing things, the world, life \u2013 were taking shape...<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 137.</ref>}}\n\nShortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the [[Tolstoyan]] Movement. Novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, \"my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit.\"<ref>Pasternak (1959) p 25</ref>\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak in youth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak c. 1908]]\nIn a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''.<ref name=\"Past28\"/> The novel was serialized in the journal ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]'' by the publisher [[Adolf Marks|Fyodor Marx]], based in St Petersburg. The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism. To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations. Pasternak wrote,\n\n{{quote|My childish imagination was struck by the sight of a train conductor in his formal railway uniform, standing waiting at the door of the kitchen as if he were standing on a railway platform at the door of a compartment that was just about to leave the station. Joiner's glue was boiling on the stove. The illustrations were hurriedly wiped dry, fixed, glued on pieces of cardboard, rolled up, tied up. The parcels, once ready, were sealed with sealing wax and handed to the conductor.<ref name=\"Past28\">Pasternak (1959) pp 27\u201328.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Max Hayward]], \"In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at [[Astapovo]], Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p ''xvi''.</ref>\n\nRegular visitors to the Pasternaks' home also included [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician.<ref>Pasternak (1967)</ref> Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]. In 1910 he abruptly left for the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Paul Natorp]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Olga Freidenberg ===\nIn 1910 Pasternak was reunited with his cousin, [[Olga Freidenberg]] (1890\u20131955). They had shared the same nursery but had been separated when the Freidenberg family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. They fell in love immediately but were never lovers. The romance however is made clear from their letters, Pasternak writing:<blockquote>\u2018You do not know how my tormenting feeling grew and grew until it became obvious to me and to others. As you walked beside me with complete detachment, I could not express it to you. It was a rare sort of closeness, as if we two, you and I, were in love with something that was utterly indifferent to both of us, something that remained aloof from us by virtue of its extraordinary inability to adapt to the other side of life.'</blockquote>The cousins' initial passion developed into a lifelong close friendship. From 1910 Pasternak and Freidenberg exchanged frequent letters, and their correspondence lasted over 40 years until 1954. The cousins last met in 1936.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ivka.rsuh.ru/binary/85345_30.1476388407.9268.pdf|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|author=Nina V.

Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school. He helped her prepare for finals. They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, [[Leonid Pasternak]], painted her portrait.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 395.</ref>\n\nAlthough Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it. He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I. His first book of poems was published later that year. In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida. However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him. She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem \"Marburg\" (1917):<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>I quivered. I flared up, and then was extinguished.\nI shook. I had made a proposal\u2014but late,\nToo late. I was scared, and she had refused me.\nI pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint.</poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, ''My Sister, Life''. His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]], [[Pushkin]] and German-language Romantic poets.\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak in the 1920s]]\nDuring World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in Vsevolodovo-Vilve near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr. Zhivago'' many years later. Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. According to [[Max Hayward]],\n\n{{quote|Pasternak remained in Moscow throughout the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918\u20131920), making no attempt to escape abroad or to the [[White Movement|White-occupied]] south, as a number of other Russian writers did at the time. No doubt, like Yuri Zhivago, he was momentarily impressed by the \"splendid surgery\" of the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, but \u2013 again to judge by the evidence of the novel, and despite a personal admiration for [[Vladimir Lenin]], whom he saw at the 9th Congress of Soviets in 1921 \u2013 he soon began to harbor profound doubts about the claims and credentials of the regime, not to mention its style of rule. The terrible shortages of food and fuel, and the depredations of the [[Red Terror]], made life very precarious in those years, particularly for the \"[[bourgeois]]\" [[intelligentsia]]. In a letter written to Pasternak from abroad in the twenties, [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] reminded him of how she had run into him in the street in 1919 as he was on the way to sell some valuable books from his library in order to buy bread. He continued to write original work and to translate, but after about the middle of 1918 it became almost impossible to publish. The only way to make one's work known was to declaim it in the several \"literary\" cafes which then sprang up, or \u2013 anticipating [[samizdat]] \u2013 to circulate it in manuscript. It was in this way that ''My Sister, Life'' first became available to a wider audience.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p xxiii.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Mayakovsky Pasternak.jpg|thumb|Pasternak (second from left) in 1924, with friends including [[Lilya Brik]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]] (third from left) and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (centre)]]\nWhen it finally was published in 1922, Pasternak's ''My Sister, Life'' revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others.\n\nFollowing ''My Sister, Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their [[White emigre]] equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration.\n\nIn the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=John Bayley|title=Big Three|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5268|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 32|date= 5 December 1985|accessdate=28 September 2007|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> As the 1920s wore on, however, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with a less educated readership. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably \"The Childhood of Luvers\" and \"Safe Conduct\".\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak with family 1920s.jpg|thumb|Pasternak with Evgeniya Lurye and son]]\nIn 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye (\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435), a student at the Art Institute. The following year their son Evgenii was born.\n\nEvidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his poem \"In Memory of Reissner\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/reissner/works/hamburg/app3.htm |title=In Memory of Reissner |last1=Pasternak |first1=Boris |last2= |first2= |date=1926|website=marxists.org |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> presumably written upon the shockingly premature death from typhus of legendary Bolshevik leader [[Larisa Reisner]] aged 30 in February of that year.\n\nBy 1927, Pasternak's close friends [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Nikolai Aseyev]] were advocating the complete subordination of the arts to the needs of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921\u20131960,'' p 78.</ref> In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, \"break off relations,\" with both of them. Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented. He explained,\n\n{{quote|They don't in any way measure up to their exalted calling. In fact, they've fallen short of it but \u2013 difficult as it is for me to understand \u2013 a modern [[sophist]] might say that these last years have actually demanded a reduction in conscience and feeling in the name of greater intelligibility. Yet now the very spirit of the times demands great, courageous purity. And these men are ruled by trivial routine. Subjectively, they're sincere and conscientious. But I find it increasingly difficult to take into account the personal aspect of their convictions. I'm not out on my own \u2013 people treat me well. But all that only holds good up to a point. It seems to me that I've reached that point.<ref>Nicholas Pasternak Slater, ''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1921\u20131960'', p 80.</ref>}}\n\nBy 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled ''The Second Birth''. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres.\n\nIn 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neuhaus, the wife of the Russian pianist [[Heinrich Neuhaus]]. They both got divorces and married two years later.\n\nHe continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, ''Early Trains'' (1943).\n\n===Stalin Epigram===\nIn April 1934 [[Osip Mandelstam]] recited his \"[[Stalin Epigram]]\" to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: \"I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 61\u201363</ref>\n\nOn the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by [[NKVD]] boss [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of ''[[Izvestia]]'' and begged [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf.\n\nSoon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] said, \"Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wishes to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/> According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. \"He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard ''his'' voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar ''thou'' form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'\" Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an \"eager fumbling manner\" Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: \"I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade,\" and put down the receiver.<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/>\n\n===Great Purge===\n{{Main|Great Purge}}\nAccording to Pasternak, during the 1937 [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|show trial]] of General [[Iona Yakir]] and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants. When Pasternak refused to sign, even after leadership of the Union visited and threatened him.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 132\u2013133</ref>\nSoon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin, describing his family's strong [[Tolstoyan]] convictions and putting his own life at Stalin's disposal; he said that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death. Pasternak was certain that he would be arrested,<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\"/> but instead Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list, reportedly declaring, \"Do not touch this cloud dweller\" (or, in another version, \"Leave that [[Foolishness for Christ|holy fool]] alone!\")<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>\n\nPasternak's close friend [[Titsian Tabidze]] did fall victim to the Great Purge. In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the suicides of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Paolo Iashvili]] as the greatest heartbreaks of his life.\n\nIvinskaya wrote, \"I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent [[duel]].\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 135.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]] began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street. According to Ivinskaya, he repeatedly helped to dispose of German bombs which fell on it.<ref name=\"Ivin72\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front. He bore it well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.<ref name=\"Ivin72\"/>\n\nWith the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of [[Nazism]], and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. Some were [[Nazi collaborator]]s who had fought under General [[Andrey Vlasov]], but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet [[concentration camp]]s. [[White emigre]]s who had returned due to pledges of [[amnesty]] were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]] and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the [[Leningrad Affair]] and the so-called [[Doctor's Plot]], while whole ethnic groups were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]].<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 75.</ref>\n\nPasternak later said, \"If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Then, an end to the war in favour of our [[Allies of World War II|allies]], civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 80.</ref>\n\n===Olga Ivinskaya===\nIn October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met [[Olga Ivinskaya]], a 34 year old single mother employed by ''[[Novy Mir]]''. Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya,<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) pp 12, 395, footnote 3.</ref> Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, \"He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was \"busy today.\" But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask.\"\n\nShe gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below. In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 12.</ref>\n\nWhen they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]. Pasternak gave his lover a book of Pet\u0151fi with the inscription, \"Pet\u0151fi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you. In memory of it all, B.P., 13 May 1948.\"\n\nPasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, \"Pet\u0151fi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 27.</ref> Ivinskaya would later describe the Pet\u0151fi translations as, \"a first declaration of love.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 28.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova told him that he must do it himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.\n\nIvinskaya later recalled,\n\n{{quote|But I became so ill through loss of blood that she and Luisa had to get me to the hospital, and I no longer remember exactly what passed between me and this heavily built, strong-minded woman, who kept repeating how she didn't give a damn for our love and that, although she no longer loved [Boris Leonidovich] herself, she would not allow her family to be broken up. After my return from the hospital, Boris came to visit me, as though nothing had happened, and touchingly made his peace with my mother, telling her how much he loved me. By now she was pretty well used to these funny ways of his.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at ''Novy Mir'', which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship. In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry. In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, \"Our Shop.\"\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the [[KGB]]. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the [[Korean poetry|Korean poet]] Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya was taken to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the [[GULAG]].\n\nUpon learning of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to [[Gogol Boulevard]]. She found him sitting on a bench near the [[Kropotkinskaya|Palace of Soviets Metro Station]]. Weeping, Pasternak told her, \"Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, \"After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer.' Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]]\u2014who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her. He worked intensively on the second part of ''Doctor Zhivago''.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\"/>\n\nIn a 1958 letter to a friend in [[West Germany]], Pasternak wrote, \"She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the [[KGB|secret police]] to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial. I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 109.</ref>\n\n===Translating Goethe===\nPasternak's translation of the [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|first part]] of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of ''[[Novy Mir]]''. The critic accused Pasternak of distorting [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s \"progressive\" meanings to support \"the reactionary theory of 'pure art'\", as well as introducing aesthetic and [[individualist]] values. In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which ''Novy Mir'' considered, \"irrational,\" had been translated as Goethe had written them. Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part]] had not been revoked.<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\n===Khrushchev thaw===\nWhen Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the [[Gulag]], and Pasternak was in Moscow. Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief. Pasternak wrote, \"Men who are not free... always idealize their bondage.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 144.</ref>\n\nAfter her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off. Soon after he confided in her, \"For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities.\"<ref name=\"Ivin142\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 142.</ref> During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in English. In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], in the novel, \"vividly reminded\" him of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref name=\"Ivin142\"/>\n\n===''Doctor Zhivago''===\n\nAlthough it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to [[Novy Mir]], which refused publication due to its rejection of [[socialist realism]].<ref>\"Doctor Zhivago\": Letter to Boris Pasternak from the Editors of ''Novyi Mir''. Daedalus, Vol. 89, No. 3, The Russian Intelligentsia (Summer, 1960), pp.&nbsp;648\u2013668</ref> The author, like his [[protagonist]] [[Yuri Zhivago]], showed more concern for the welfare of individual characters than for the \"progress\" of society. Censors also regarded some passages as [[anti-Soviet]], especially the novel's criticisms<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/world/doctor-zhivago-to-see-print-in-soviet-in-88.html|title='Doctor Zhivago' to See Print in Soviet in '88|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=13 February 1987|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 February 2019|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> of [[Stalinism]], [[Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]], and the [[Gulag]].\n\nPasternak's fortunes were soon to change, however. In March 1956, the [[Italian Communist Party]] sent a journalist, [[Sergio D'Angelo]], to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of ''Doctor Zhivago'''s existence, D'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told D'Angelo with a laugh, \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"<ref>Lazar Fleishman, ''Boris Pasternak: The Poet and His Politics'', p 275.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk. No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on [[Boris Pilnyak]] and [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.<ref>Fleishman, pp 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of ''Doctor Zhivago'' to a Western publishing house. Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see ''Doctor Zhivago'' published.<ref>Fleishman, p 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company. Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication. According to Ivinskaya, \"He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world \u2013 this would be an even greater crime.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 203.</ref> The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nHelped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world \u2013 see \"Nobel Prize\" section below), ''Doctor Zhivago'' became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957. In the [[State of Israel]], however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] views towards the [[Jewish people]]. When informed of this, Pasternak responded, \"No matter. I am above race...\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 136.</ref> According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence. At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]]. Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into [[atheism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Fleishman, pp 264\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThe first English translation of ''Doctor Zhivago'' was hastily produced by [[Max Hayward]] and [[Manya Harari]] in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand. It was released in August 1958, and remained the only edition available for more than fifty years. Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list.\n\nIvinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in [[Samizdat]]. Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, ''Doctor Zhivago'' was pilloried in the State-owned press. Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, \"I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDuring the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on [[Gospel]] themes. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, \"giant of the pre-Christian era.\" Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, \"a form of protest.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 134.</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1958, the ''Literary Gazette'' critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, \"the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] suitcase of 1908\u201310 manufacture.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 231.</ref> Furthermore, the author received much [[hate mail]] from Communists both at home and abroad. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 230.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading ''Doctor Zhivago''. She had said, \"Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work. It was the [[Russian people]] and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen.\"<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1912\u20131960,'' p 403.</ref>\n\n===Nobel Prize===\n[[File:Miniature Volume of Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|Copy of the original Russian-language edition of ''Doctor Zhivago'', covertly published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

According to the former Nobel Committee head [[Lars Gyllensten]], his nomination was discussed every year from 1946 to 1950, then again in 1957 (it was finally awarded in 1958). Pasternak guessed at this from the growing waves of criticism in USSR. Sometimes he had to justify his European fame: 'According to the Union of Soviet Writers, some literature circles of the West see unusual importance in my work, not matching its modesty and low productivity\u2026'\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/18-12-2003/4383-pasternak-0/ |title=Boris Pasternak: Nobel Prize, Son's Memoirs |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist Ivan Tolstoi, the British [[MI6]] and the American [[CIA]] lent a hand to ensure that ''Doctor Zhivago'' was submitted to the [[Nobel Committee]] in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the [[Soviet Union]].

Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger.\n\nOn 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize. The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in \"continuing the great Russian epic tradition.\" On 25 October, Pasternak sent a [[telegram]] to the [[Swedish Academy]]: \"Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 221.</ref> That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel.

Slutsky, who in his brutal prose-like poems had created an image for himself as a courageous soldier and truth-lover, was so tormented by his anti-Pasternak speech that he later went insane. On October 29, 1958, at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, dedicated to the [[Komsomol]]'s fortieth anniversary, its head, [[Vladimir Semichastny]], attacked Pasternak before an audience of 14,000 people, including Khrushchev and other Party leaders. Semishastny first called Pasternak, \"a mangy sheep,\" who pleased the enemies of the Soviet Union with, \"his slanderous so-called work.\" Then Semichastny (who became head of the KGB in 1961) added that, \"this man went and spat in the face of the people.\" And he concluded with, \"If you compare Pasternak to a pig, a pig would not do what he did,\" because a pig, \"never shits where it eats.\" Khrushchev applauded demonstratively. News of that speech drove Pasternak to the brink of suicide. It has recently come to light that the real author of Semichastny's insults was Khrushchev, who had called the Komsomol leader the night before and dictated his lines about the mangy sheep and the pig, which Semichastny described as a, \"typically Khrushchevian, deliberately crude, unceremoniously scolding.\"<ref>Solomon Volkov, ''The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn'', Alfred A.

Furthermore, he was threatened at the very least with formal exile to the West. In response, Pasternak wrote directly to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]],\n\n{{quote|I am addressing you personally, the C.C. of the C.P.S.S., and the Soviet Government. From Comrade Semichastny's speech I learn that the government, 'would not put any obstacles in the way of my departure from the U.S.S.R.' For me this is impossible. I am tied to Russia by birth, by my life and work. I cannot conceive of my destiny separate from Russia, or outside it. Whatever my mistakes or failings, I could not imagine that I should find myself at the center of such a political campaign as has been worked up round my name in the West. Once I was aware of this, I informed the Swedish Academy of my voluntary renunciation of the Nobel Prize. Departure beyond the borders of my country would for me be tantamount to death and I therefore request you not to take this extreme measure with me. With my hand on my heart, I can say that I have done something for Soviet literature, and may still be of use to it.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 240\u2013241.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''The Oak and the Calf'', [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] sharply criticized Pasternak, both for declining the Nobel Prize and for sending such a letter to Khrushchev. In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions.\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, \"She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize. After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can... understand her: the memory of Stalin's camps was too fresh, [and] she tried to protect him.\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1958, the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] held a trial behind closed doors. According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal [[White emigre]] and a Fascist [[fifth columnist]]. Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union. They further signed a petition to the [[Politburo]], demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, \"his Capitalist paradise.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 251\u2013261.</ref> According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] refused to attend the meeting. [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] did attend, but walked out in disgust.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to organize a Committee for Pasternak's protection.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nIt is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Bill Mauldin]] produced [[:File:I won the Nobel Prize for Literature.jpg|a cartoon about Pasternak]] that won the 1959 [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].

If 'eternal' themes were to be dealt with yet again, then only by a poet in the true sense of the word \u2013 otherwise he should not have the strength of character to touch them at all. Poetry so tightly packed (till it crunched like ice) or distilled into a solution where 'grains of true prose germinated,' a poetry in which realistic detail cast a genuine spell \u2013 only such poetry was acceptable to Pasternak; but not poetry for which indulgence was required, or for which allowances had to be made \u2013 that is, the kind of ephemeral poetry which is particularly common in an age of literary conformism. [Boris Leonidovich] could weep over the 'purple-gray circle' which glowed above [[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s tormented muse and he never failed to be moved by the terseness of [[Pushkin]]'s sprightly lines, but rhymed slogans about the production of tin cans in the so-called 'poetry' of [[Surkov]] and his like, as well as the outpourings about love in the work of those young poets who only echo each other and the classics \u2013 all this left him cold at best and for the most part made him indignant.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 145.</ref>}}\n\nFor this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse. According to Ivinskaya, \"It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry.'\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\"/>\n\nAlso according to Ivinskaya, \"'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed \u2013 by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the ''Literary Gazette'': 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there \u2013 it would be better to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 146.</ref>\n\n====Translation====\nReluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family. He soon produced acclaimed translations of [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]]. [[Osip Mandelstam]], however, privately warned him, \"Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, \"I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation. The work of Lozinski, Radlova, [[Samuil Marshak|Marshak]], and [[Kornei Chukovsky|Chukovski]] is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth. I share the nineteenth-century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text. He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.<ref name=\"Ivin28\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nPasternak's translations of [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''King Henry IV'' (Parts I and II), ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'')<ref>Boris Pasternak (1959) ''I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography'', Pantheon Books. p 127.</ref> remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of \"pasternakizing\" Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, \"Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort. Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author. Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience.\"<ref>Pasternak, (1959) p 142.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating [[Paul Verlaine]] in a burst of enthusiasm like this \u2013 ''[[:s:fr:Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)|Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)]]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 34.</ref>}}\n\nWhile they were both collaborating on translating [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, \"1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular [[Meter (poetry)|meters]], mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use [[assonance]]s.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>\n\nLater, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], Pasternak told Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Use the literal translation only for the ''meaning'', but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original \u2013 an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak. She later recalled:\n\n{{quote|One day someone brought him a copy of a British newspaper in which there was a double feature under the title, \"Pasternak Keeps a Courageous Silence.\" It said that if Shakespeare had written in Russian he would have written in the same way he was translated by Pasternak... What a pity, the article continued, that Pasternak published nothing but translations, writing his own work for himself and a small circle of intimate friends. \"What do they mean by saying that my silence is courageous?\" [Boris Leonidovich] commented sadly after reading all this. \"I am silent because I am not printed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 35.</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nBoris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it. He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Theodor Leschetizky]], and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home. The family had a [[dacha]] (country house) close to one occupied by [[Alexander Scriabin]]. [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's [[Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)|Symphony No. 3]] (''The Divine Poem''), in 1903.\n\nPasternak began to compose at the age of 13. The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but \u2013 inspired by Scriabin \u2013 he entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in [[Marburg University]]. Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by [[Aleksandr Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], the same year.\n\nPasternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin. His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Rayki, some 40&nbsp;km north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students. (N.B. This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at [[Peredelkino]], which is about 20&nbsp;km south-west of the capital.)\n\n==Selected books by Pasternak==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Twin in the Clouds'' (1914)\n*''Over the Barriers'' (1916)\n*''Themes and Variations'' (1917)\n*''My Sister, Life'' (1922)\n*''On Early Trains'' (1944)\n*''Selected Poems'' (1946)\n*''Poems'' (1954)\n*''When the Weather Clears'' (1959)\n*''In The Interlude: Poems 1945\u20131960'' (1962)\n\n===Books of prose===\n*''Safe Conduct'' (1931)\n*''Second Birth'' (1932)\n*''[[The Last Summer (Pasternak novella)|The Last Summer]]'' (1934)\n*''Childhood'' (1941)\n*''Selected Writings'' (1949)\n*''Collected Works'' (1945)\n*''Goethe's Faust'' (1952)\n*''Essay in Autobiography'' (1956)\n*''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[List of Jewish Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember; Sketches for an Autobiography'', [[Pantheon Books]], 1959.\n* Boris Pasternak. \"Sister, My Life\" Translated by C.

''Doctor Zhivago'' was rejected for publication in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], but the manuscript was smuggled to Italy for publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-declassifies-agency-role-in-publishing-doctor-zhivago.html|title=CIA Declassifies Agency Role in Publishing Doctor Zhivago \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958, an event that enraged the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were able to accept it in his name in 1988.

His mother was [[Rosa Kaufman]], a concert pianist and the daughter of [[Odessa]] industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife. Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters [[Lydia Pasternak Slater|Lydia]] and Josephine. The family claimed to be descended on the paternal line from [[Isaac Abarbanel]], the famous 15th-century [[Sephardic Jewish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Rabbinic commentaries|Bible commentator]], and treasurer of [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher Barnes|author2=Christopher J.

Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, L'wow) to study history and philosophy. The good dimension of the character Strelnikov in Dr. Zhivago is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia.\n\nIn a 1959 letter to Jacqueline de Proyart, Pasternak recalled,\n\n{{quote|I was baptized as a child by my [[nanny]], but because of the restrictions imposed on Jews, particularly in the case of a family which was exempt from them and enjoyed a certain reputation in view of my father's standing as an artist, there was something a little complicated about this, and it was always felt to be half-secret and intimate, a source of rare and exceptional inspiration rather than being calmly taken for granted. I believe that this is at the root of my distinctiveness. Most intensely of all my mind was occupied by Christianity in the years 1910\u201312, when the main foundations of this distinctiveness \u2013 my way of seeing things, the world, life \u2013 were taking shape...<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 137.</ref>}}\n\nShortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the [[Tolstoyan]] Movement. Novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, \"my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit.\"<ref>Pasternak (1959) p 25</ref>\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak in youth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak c. 1908]]\nIn a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''.<ref name=\"Past28\"/> The novel was serialized in the journal ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]'' by the publisher [[Adolf Marks|Fyodor Marx]], based in St Petersburg. The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism. To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations. Pasternak wrote,\n\n{{quote|My childish imagination was struck by the sight of a train conductor in his formal railway uniform, standing waiting at the door of the kitchen as if he were standing on a railway platform at the door of a compartment that was just about to leave the station. Joiner's glue was boiling on the stove. The illustrations were hurriedly wiped dry, fixed, glued on pieces of cardboard, rolled up, tied up. The parcels, once ready, were sealed with sealing wax and handed to the conductor.<ref name=\"Past28\">Pasternak (1959) pp 27\u201328.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Max Hayward]], \"In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at [[Astapovo]], Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p ''xvi''.</ref>\n\nRegular visitors to the Pasternaks' home also included [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician.<ref>Pasternak (1967)</ref> Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]. In 1910 he abruptly left for the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Paul Natorp]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Olga Freidenberg ===\nIn 1910 Pasternak was reunited with his cousin, [[Olga Freidenberg]] (1890\u20131955). They had shared the same nursery but had been separated when the Freidenberg family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. They fell in love immediately but were never lovers. The romance however is made clear from their letters, Pasternak writing:<blockquote>\u2018You do not know how my tormenting feeling grew and grew until it became obvious to me and to others. As you walked beside me with complete detachment, I could not express it to you. It was a rare sort of closeness, as if we two, you and I, were in love with something that was utterly indifferent to both of us, something that remained aloof from us by virtue of its extraordinary inability to adapt to the other side of life.'</blockquote>The cousins' initial passion developed into a lifelong close friendship. From 1910 Pasternak and Freidenberg exchanged frequent letters, and their correspondence lasted over 40 years until 1954. The cousins last met in 1936.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ivka.rsuh.ru/binary/85345_30.1476388407.9268.pdf|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|author=Nina V.

Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school. He helped her prepare for finals. They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, [[Leonid Pasternak]], painted her portrait.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 395.</ref>\n\nAlthough Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it. He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I. His first book of poems was published later that year. In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida. However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him. She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem \"Marburg\" (1917):<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 p 395\"/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>I quivered. I flared up, and then was extinguished.\nI shook. I had made a proposal\u2014but late,\nToo late. I was scared, and she had refused me.\nI pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint.</poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, ''My Sister, Life''. His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]], [[Pushkin]] and German-language Romantic poets.\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pasternak in the 1920s]]\nDuring World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in Vsevolodovo-Vilve near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr. Zhivago'' many years later. Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. According to [[Max Hayward]],\n\n{{quote|Pasternak remained in Moscow throughout the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918\u20131920), making no attempt to escape abroad or to the [[White Movement|White-occupied]] south, as a number of other Russian writers did at the time. No doubt, like Yuri Zhivago, he was momentarily impressed by the \"splendid surgery\" of the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, but \u2013 again to judge by the evidence of the novel, and despite a personal admiration for [[Vladimir Lenin]], whom he saw at the 9th Congress of Soviets in 1921 \u2013 he soon began to harbor profound doubts about the claims and credentials of the regime, not to mention its style of rule. The terrible shortages of food and fuel, and the depredations of the [[Red Terror]], made life very precarious in those years, particularly for the \"[[bourgeois]]\" [[intelligentsia]]. In a letter written to Pasternak from abroad in the twenties, [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] reminded him of how she had run into him in the street in 1919 as he was on the way to sell some valuable books from his library in order to buy bread. He continued to write original work and to translate, but after about the middle of 1918 it became almost impossible to publish. The only way to make one's work known was to declaim it in the several \"literary\" cafes which then sprang up, or \u2013 anticipating [[samizdat]] \u2013 to circulate it in manuscript. It was in this way that ''My Sister, Life'' first became available to a wider audience.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p xxiii.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Mayakovsky Pasternak.jpg|thumb|Pasternak (second from left) in 1924, with friends including [[Lilya Brik]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]] (third from left) and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (centre)]]\nWhen it finally was published in 1922, Pasternak's ''My Sister, Life'' revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others.\n\nFollowing ''My Sister, Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their [[White emigre]] equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration.\n\nIn the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=John Bayley|title=Big Three|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5268|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 32|date= 5 December 1985|accessdate=28 September 2007|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> As the 1920s wore on, however, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with a less educated readership. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably \"The Childhood of Luvers\" and \"Safe Conduct\".\n\n[[File:Boris Pasternak with family 1920s.jpg|thumb|Pasternak with Evgeniya Lurye and son]]\nIn 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye (\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0435), a student at the Art Institute. The following year their son Evgenii was born.\n\nEvidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his poem \"In Memory of Reissner\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/reissner/works/hamburg/app3.htm |title=In Memory of Reissner |last1=Pasternak |first1=Boris |last2= |first2= |date=1926|website=marxists.org |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> presumably written upon the shockingly premature death from typhus of legendary Bolshevik leader [[Larisa Reisner]] aged 30 in February of that year.\n\nBy 1927, Pasternak's close friends [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Nikolai Aseyev]] were advocating the complete subordination of the arts to the needs of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921\u20131960,'' p 78.</ref> In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, \"break off relations,\" with both of them. Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented. He explained,\n\n{{quote|They don't in any way measure up to their exalted calling. In fact, they've fallen short of it but \u2013 difficult as it is for me to understand \u2013 a modern [[sophist]] might say that these last years have actually demanded a reduction in conscience and feeling in the name of greater intelligibility. Yet now the very spirit of the times demands great, courageous purity. And these men are ruled by trivial routine. Subjectively, they're sincere and conscientious. But I find it increasingly difficult to take into account the personal aspect of their convictions. I'm not out on my own \u2013 people treat me well. But all that only holds good up to a point. It seems to me that I've reached that point.<ref>Nicholas Pasternak Slater, ''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1921\u20131960'', p 80.</ref>}}\n\nBy 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled ''The Second Birth''. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres.\n\nIn 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neuhaus, the wife of the Russian pianist [[Heinrich Neuhaus]]. They both got divorces and married two years later.\n\nHe continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, ''Early Trains'' (1943).\n\n===Stalin Epigram===\nIn April 1934 [[Osip Mandelstam]] recited his \"[[Stalin Epigram]]\" to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: \"I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 61\u201363</ref>\n\nOn the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by [[NKVD]] boss [[Genrikh Yagoda]]. Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of ''[[Izvestia]]'' and begged [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf.\n\nSoon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] said, \"Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wishes to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/> According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. \"He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard ''his'' voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar ''thou'' form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'\" Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an \"eager fumbling manner\" Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: \"I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade,\" and put down the receiver.<ref name=\"Ivin61\"/>\n\n===Great Purge===\n{{Main|Great Purge}}\nAccording to Pasternak, during the 1937 [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|show trial]] of General [[Iona Yakir]] and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants. When Pasternak refused to sign, even after leadership of the Union visited and threatened him.<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 132\u2013133</ref>\nSoon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin, describing his family's strong [[Tolstoyan]] convictions and putting his own life at Stalin's disposal; he said that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death. Pasternak was certain that he would be arrested,<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133\"/> but instead Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list, reportedly declaring, \"Do not touch this cloud dweller\" (or, in another version, \"Leave that [[Foolishness for Christ|holy fool]] alone!\")<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>\n\nPasternak's close friend [[Titsian Tabidze]] did fall victim to the Great Purge. In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the suicides of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Paolo Iashvili]] as the greatest heartbreaks of his life.\n\nIvinskaya wrote, \"I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent [[duel]].\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 135.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWhen the [[Luftwaffe]] began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street. According to Ivinskaya, he repeatedly helped to dispose of German bombs which fell on it.<ref name=\"Ivin72\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front. He bore it well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.<ref name=\"Ivin72\"/>\n\nWith the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of [[Nazism]], and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. Some were [[Nazi collaborator]]s who had fought under General [[Andrey Vlasov]], but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet [[concentration camp]]s. [[White emigre]]s who had returned due to pledges of [[amnesty]] were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]] and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the [[Leningrad Affair]] and the so-called [[Doctor's Plot]], while whole ethnic groups were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]].<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 75.</ref>\n\nPasternak later said, \"If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Then, an end to the war in favour of our [[Allies of World War II|allies]], civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 80.</ref>\n\n===Olga Ivinskaya===\nIn October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met [[Olga Ivinskaya]], a 34 year old single mother employed by ''[[Novy Mir]]''. Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya,<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) pp 12, 395, footnote 3.</ref> Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, \"He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was \"busy today.\" But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask.\"\n\nShe gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below. In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 12.</ref>\n\nWhen they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]. Pasternak gave his lover a book of Pet\u0151fi with the inscription, \"Pet\u0151fi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you. In memory of it all, B.P., 13 May 1948.\"\n\nPasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, \"Pet\u0151fi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 27.</ref> Ivinskaya would later describe the Pet\u0151fi translations as, \"a first declaration of love.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 28.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova told him that he must do it himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.\n\nIvinskaya later recalled,\n\n{{quote|But I became so ill through loss of blood that she and Luisa had to get me to the hospital, and I no longer remember exactly what passed between me and this heavily built, strong-minded woman, who kept repeating how she didn't give a damn for our love and that, although she no longer loved [Boris Leonidovich] herself, she would not allow her family to be broken up. After my return from the hospital, Boris came to visit me, as though nothing had happened, and touchingly made his peace with my mother, telling her how much he loved me. By now she was pretty well used to these funny ways of his.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 23.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at ''Novy Mir'', which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship. In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry. In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, \"Our Shop.\"\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the [[KGB]]. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the [[Korean poetry|Korean poet]] Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya was taken to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the [[GULAG]].\n\nUpon learning of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to [[Gogol Boulevard]]. She found him sitting on a bench near the [[Kropotkinskaya|Palace of Soviets Metro Station]]. Weeping, Pasternak told her, \"Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 86.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, \"After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer.' Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]]\u2014who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her. He worked intensively on the second part of ''Doctor Zhivago''.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 86\"/>\n\nIn a 1958 letter to a friend in [[West Germany]], Pasternak wrote, \"She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the [[KGB|secret police]] to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial. I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 109.</ref>\n\n===Translating Goethe===\nPasternak's translation of the [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|first part]] of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of ''[[Novy Mir]]''. The critic accused Pasternak of distorting [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s \"progressive\" meanings to support \"the reactionary theory of 'pure art'\", as well as introducing aesthetic and [[individualist]] values. In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which ''Novy Mir'' considered, \"irrational,\" had been translated as Goethe had written them. Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part]] had not been revoked.<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\n===Khrushchev thaw===\nWhen Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the [[Gulag]], and Pasternak was in Moscow. Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief. Pasternak wrote, \"Men who are not free... always idealize their bondage.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 144.</ref>\n\nAfter her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off. Soon after he confided in her, \"For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities.\"<ref name=\"Ivin142\">Ivinskaya (1978) p 142.</ref> During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in English. In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], in the novel, \"vividly reminded\" him of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].<ref name=\"Ivin142\"/>\n\n===''Doctor Zhivago''===\n\nAlthough it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to [[Novy Mir]], which refused publication due to its rejection of [[socialist realism]].<ref>\"Doctor Zhivago\": Letter to Boris Pasternak from the Editors of ''Novyi Mir''. Daedalus, Vol. 89, No. 3, The Russian Intelligentsia (Summer, 1960), pp.&nbsp;648\u2013668</ref> The author, like his [[protagonist]] [[Yuri Zhivago]], showed more concern for the welfare of individual characters than for the \"progress\" of society. Censors also regarded some passages as [[anti-Soviet]], especially the novel's criticisms<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/world/doctor-zhivago-to-see-print-in-soviet-in-88.html|title='Doctor Zhivago' to See Print in Soviet in '88|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=13 February 1987|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 February 2019|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> of [[Stalinism]], [[Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]], and the [[Gulag]].\n\nPasternak's fortunes were soon to change, however. In March 1956, the [[Italian Communist Party]] sent a journalist, [[Sergio D'Angelo]], to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of ''Doctor Zhivago'''s existence, D'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told D'Angelo with a laugh, \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"<ref>Lazar Fleishman, ''Boris Pasternak: The Poet and His Politics'', p 275.</ref>\n\nAccording to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk. No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on [[Boris Pilnyak]] and [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.<ref>Fleishman, pp 275\u2013276.</ref>\n\nIn a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of ''Doctor Zhivago'' to a Western publishing house. Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see ''Doctor Zhivago'' published.<ref>Fleishman, p 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company. Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication. According to Ivinskaya, \"He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world \u2013 this would be an even greater crime.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 203.</ref> The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nHelped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world \u2013 see \"Nobel Prize\" section below), ''Doctor Zhivago'' became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957. In the [[State of Israel]], however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] views towards the [[Jewish people]]. When informed of this, Pasternak responded, \"No matter. I am above race...\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 136.</ref> According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence. At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]]. Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into [[atheism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Fleishman, pp 264\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThe first English translation of ''Doctor Zhivago'' was hastily produced by [[Max Hayward]] and [[Manya Harari]] in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand. It was released in August 1958, and remained the only edition available for more than fifty years. Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list.\n\nIvinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in [[Samizdat]]. Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, ''Doctor Zhivago'' was pilloried in the State-owned press. Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, \"I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDuring the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on [[Gospel]] themes. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, \"giant of the pre-Christian era.\" Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, \"a form of protest.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 134.</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1958, the ''Literary Gazette'' critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, \"the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] suitcase of 1908\u201310 manufacture.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 231.</ref> Furthermore, the author received much [[hate mail]] from Communists both at home and abroad. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 230.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading ''Doctor Zhivago''. She had said, \"Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work. It was the [[Russian people]] and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen.\"<ref>''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1912\u20131960,'' p 403.</ref>\n\n===Nobel Prize===\n[[File:Miniature Volume of Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|Copy of the original Russian-language edition of ''Doctor Zhivago'', covertly published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

According to the former Nobel Committee head [[Lars Gyllensten]], his nomination was discussed every year from 1946 to 1950, then again in 1957 (it was finally awarded in 1958). Pasternak guessed at this from the growing waves of criticism in USSR. Sometimes he had to justify his European fame: 'According to the Union of Soviet Writers, some literature circles of the West see unusual importance in my work, not matching its modesty and low productivity\u2026'\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/showbiz/18-12-2003/4383-pasternak-0/ |title=Boris Pasternak: Nobel Prize, Son's Memoirs |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist Ivan Tolstoi, the British [[MI6]] and the American [[CIA]] lent a hand to ensure that ''Doctor Zhivago'' was submitted to the [[Nobel Committee]] in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the [[Soviet Union]].

Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger.\n\nOn 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize. The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in \"continuing the great Russian epic tradition.\" On 25 October, Pasternak sent a [[telegram]] to the [[Swedish Academy]]: \"Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 221.</ref> That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel.

Slutsky, who in his brutal prose-like poems had created an image for himself as a courageous soldier and truth-lover, was so tormented by his anti-Pasternak speech that he later went insane. On October 29, 1958, at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, dedicated to the [[Komsomol]]'s fortieth anniversary, its head, [[Vladimir Semichastny]], attacked Pasternak before an audience of 14,000 people, including Khrushchev and other Party leaders. Semishastny first called Pasternak, \"a mangy sheep,\" who pleased the enemies of the Soviet Union with, \"his slanderous so-called work.\" Then Semichastny (who became head of the KGB in 1961) added that, \"this man went and spat in the face of the people.\" And he concluded with, \"If you compare Pasternak to a pig, a pig would not do what he did,\" because a pig, \"never shits where it eats.\" Khrushchev applauded demonstratively. News of that speech drove Pasternak to the brink of suicide. It has recently come to light that the real author of Semichastny's insults was Khrushchev, who had called the Komsomol leader the night before and dictated his lines about the mangy sheep and the pig, which Semichastny described as a, \"typically Khrushchevian, deliberately crude, unceremoniously scolding.\"<ref>Solomon Volkov, ''The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn'', Alfred A.

Furthermore, he was threatened at the very least with formal exile to the West. In response, Pasternak wrote directly to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]],\n\n{{quote|I am addressing you personally, the C.C. of the C.P.S.S., and the Soviet Government. From Comrade Semichastny's speech I learn that the government, 'would not put any obstacles in the way of my departure from the U.S.S.R.' For me this is impossible. I am tied to Russia by birth, by my life and work. I cannot conceive of my destiny separate from Russia, or outside it. Whatever my mistakes or failings, I could not imagine that I should find myself at the center of such a political campaign as has been worked up round my name in the West. Once I was aware of this, I informed the Swedish Academy of my voluntary renunciation of the Nobel Prize. Departure beyond the borders of my country would for me be tantamount to death and I therefore request you not to take this extreme measure with me.

In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions.\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, \"She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize. After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can... understand her: the memory of Stalin's camps was too fresh, [and] she tried to protect him.\"<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nOn 31 October 1958, the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] held a trial behind closed doors. According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal [[White emigre]] and a Fascist [[fifth columnist]]. Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union. They further signed a petition to the [[Politburo]], demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, \"his Capitalist paradise.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), pp 251\u2013261.</ref> According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] refused to attend the meeting. [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] did attend, but walked out in disgust.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nAccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to organize a Committee for Pasternak's protection.<ref name=\"english.pravda.ru\"/>\n\nIt is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.{{r|washingtonpost}}\n\nMeanwhile, [[Bill Mauldin]] produced [[:File:I won the Nobel Prize for Literature.jpg|a cartoon about Pasternak]] that won the 1959 [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].

The film, which toured in the [[roadshow]] tradition, starred [[Omar Sharif]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], and [[Julie Christie]]. Concentrating on the [[love triangle]] aspects of the novel, the film became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until [[Perestroika]].\n\nIn 2002, the novel was adapted as a [[Doctor Zhivago (TV serial)|television miniseries]]. Directed by Giacomo Campiotti, the serial starred [[Hans Matheson]], [[Alexandra Maria Lara]], [[Keira Knightley]], and [[Sam Neill]].\n\nThe Russian TV version of 2006, directed by [[Aleksandr Proshkin]] and starring [[Oleg Menshikov]] as Zhivago, is considered more faithful to Pasternak's novel than David Lean's 1965 film.\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetry===\n\n====Thoughts on poetry====\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|In Pasternak the 'all-powerful god of detail' always, it seems, revolted against the idea of turning out verse for its own sake or to convey vague personal moods. If 'eternal' themes were to be dealt with yet again, then only by a poet in the true sense of the word \u2013 otherwise he should not have the strength of character to touch them at all. Poetry so tightly packed (till it crunched like ice) or distilled into a solution where 'grains of true prose germinated,' a poetry in which realistic detail cast a genuine spell \u2013 only such poetry was acceptable to Pasternak; but not poetry for which indulgence was required, or for which allowances had to be made \u2013 that is, the kind of ephemeral poetry which is particularly common in an age of literary conformism. [Boris Leonidovich] could weep over the 'purple-gray circle' which glowed above [[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s tormented muse and he never failed to be moved by the terseness of [[Pushkin]]'s sprightly lines, but rhymed slogans about the production of tin cans in the so-called 'poetry' of [[Surkov]] and his like, as well as the outpourings about love in the work of those young poets who only echo each other and the classics \u2013 all this left him cold at best and for the most part made him indignant.\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\">Ivinskaya (1978), p 145.</ref>}}\n\nFor this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse. According to Ivinskaya, \"It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry.'\"<ref name=\"Ivinskaya 1978, p 145\"/>\n\nAlso according to Ivinskaya, \"'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed \u2013 by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the ''Literary Gazette'': 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there \u2013 it would be better to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 146.</ref>\n\n====Translation====\nReluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family. He soon produced acclaimed translations of [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]]. [[Osip Mandelstam]], however, privately warned him, \"Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, \"I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation. The work of Lozinski, Radlova, [[Samuil Marshak|Marshak]], and [[Kornei Chukovsky|Chukovski]] is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth. I share the nineteenth-century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach.\"<ref name=\"Ivin78\"/>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text. He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.<ref name=\"Ivin28\">Ivinskaya (1978) pp 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nPasternak's translations of [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''King Henry IV'' (Parts I and II), ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'')<ref>Boris Pasternak (1959) ''I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography'', Pantheon Books. p 127.</ref> remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of \"pasternakizing\" Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, \"Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort. Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author. Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience.\"<ref>Pasternak, (1959) p 142.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating [[Paul Verlaine]] in a burst of enthusiasm like this \u2013 ''[[:s:fr:Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)|Art po\u00e9tique (Verlaine)]]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry.<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 34.</ref>}}\n\nWhile they were both collaborating on translating [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, \"1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular [[Meter (poetry)|meters]], mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use [[assonance]]s.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>\n\nLater, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], Pasternak told Ivinskaya:\n\n{{quote|Use the literal translation only for the ''meaning'', but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original \u2013 an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work.\"<ref name=\"Ivin28\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak. She later recalled:\n\n{{quote|One day someone brought him a copy of a British newspaper in which there was a double feature under the title, \"Pasternak Keeps a Courageous Silence.\" It said that if Shakespeare had written in Russian he would have written in the same way he was translated by Pasternak... What a pity, the article continued, that Pasternak published nothing but translations, writing his own work for himself and a small circle of intimate friends. \"What do they mean by saying that my silence is courageous?\" [Boris Leonidovich] commented sadly after reading all this. \"I am silent because I am not printed.\"<ref>Ivinskaya (1978), p 35.</ref>}}\n\n===Music===\nBoris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it. He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Theodor Leschetizky]], and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home. The family had a [[dacha]] (country house) close to one occupied by [[Alexander Scriabin]]. [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's [[Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)|Symphony No. 3]] (''The Divine Poem''), in 1903.\n\nPasternak began to compose at the age of 13. The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but \u2013 inspired by Scriabin \u2013 he entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in [[Marburg University]]. Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by [[Aleksandr Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], the same year.\n\nPasternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin. His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Rayki, some 40&nbsp;km north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students. (N.B. This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at [[Peredelkino]], which is about 20&nbsp;km south-west of the capital.)\n\n==Selected books by Pasternak==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Twin in the Clouds'' (1914)\n*''Over the Barriers'' (1916)\n*''Themes and Variations'' (1917)\n*''My Sister, Life'' (1922)\n*''On Early Trains'' (1944)\n*''Selected Poems'' (1946)\n*''Poems'' (1954)\n*''When the Weather Clears'' (1959)\n*''In The Interlude: Poems 1945\u20131960'' (1962)\n\n===Books of prose===\n*''Safe Conduct'' (1931)\n*''Second Birth'' (1932)\n*''[[The Last Summer (Pasternak novella)|The Last Summer]]'' (1934)\n*''Childhood'' (1941)\n*''Selected Writings'' (1949)\n*''Collected Works'' (1945)\n*''Goethe's Faust'' (1952)\n*''Essay in Autobiography'' (1956)\n*''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[List of Jewish Nobel laureates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember; Sketches for an Autobiography'', [[Pantheon Books]], 1959.\n* Boris Pasternak. \"Sister, My Life\" Translated by C.

Dunnigan was the first black female member of the Senate and House of Representatives press galleries (1947), and the first black female White House correspondent in 1948.<ref name=\"MARBL\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\nDunnigan reported on Congressional hearings where blacks were referred to as \"niggers,\" was barred from covering a speech by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in a whites-only theater, and was not allowed to sit with the press to cover Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]'s funeral \u2014 she covered the event from a seat in the servant's section. Dunnigan was known for her straight-shooting reporting style. Politicians routinely avoided answering her difficult questions, which often involved race issues.\n\nDunnigan's career in journalism began at the age of 13, when she started writing one-sentence news items for the local Owensboro Enterprise newspaper. She completed the ten years available to blacks in the segregated Russellville school system, but her parents saw no benefit in allowing their daughter to continue her education. A Sunday school teacher intervened, and Dunnigan was allowed to attend college. By the time she had reached college, Dunnigan had set her sights on becoming a teacher, and completed the teaching course at what is now Kentucky State University. Dunnigan was a teacher in Kentucky public schools from 1924 to 1942. A four-year marriage to Walter Dickenson of Mount Pisgeh ended in divorce in 1930. She married Charles Dunnigan, a childhood friend, on January 8, 1932. The couple had one child, Robert William, and separated in 1953.\n\nAs a young teacher in the segregated Todd County School system, Dunnigan taught courses in Kentucky history. She quickly learned that her students were almost completely ignorant of the historic contributions of African Americans to the state of Kentucky. She started preparing \"Kentucky Fact Sheets\" and handing them out to her students as supplements to the required text. These papers were collected for publication in 1939, but no publisher was willing to take them to press. Associated Publishers Inc. finally published the articles in 1982 as ''The Fascinating Story of Black Kentuckians: Their Heritage and Tradition''. The meager pay she earned teaching forced her to work numerous menial jobs during the summer months, when school was not in session. She washed the tombstones in the white cemetery while working four hours a day in a dairy, cleaning house for a family, and doing washing at night for another family, earning a total of about seven dollars a week.\n\nA call for government workers went out in 1942, and Dunnigan moved to Washington, D.C., during World War II seeking better pay and a government job. She worked as a federal government employee from 1942 to 1946, and took a year of night courses at [[Howard University]]. In 1946 she was offered a job writing for ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' as a Washington correspondent. ''The Defender'' was a black-owned weekly that did not use the words \"Negro\" or \"black\" in its pages. Instead, African Americans were referred to as \"the Race\" and black men and women as \"Race men and Race women.\" Unsure of Dunnigan's abilities, the editor of ''The Defender'' paid her much less than her male counterparts until she could prove her worth. She supplemented her income with other writing jobs.\n\nAs a writer for the Associated Negro Press news service, Dunnigan sought press credentials to cover Congress and the Senate. The Standing Committee of Correspondents (newspaper reporters who ran the congressional press galleries) denied her request on the grounds that she was writing for a weekly newspaper, and reporters covering the U.S. Capitol were required to write for daily publications. Six months later, however, she was granted press clearance, becoming the first African-American woman to gain accreditation. In 1947 she was named bureau chief of the Associate Negro Press, a position she held for 14 years.\n[[File:Alice Alice Dunnigan statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of first African American woman to be admitted to White House press corps]]\nIn 1948 Dunnigan was one of three African Americans and one of two women in the press corps that followed President Harry S. Truman's Western campaign, paying her own way to do it. Also that year, she became the first African-American female White House correspondent, and was the first black woman elected to the Women's National Press Club. Her association with this and other organizations allowed her to travel extensively in the United States and to Canada, Israel, South America, Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean. She was honored by Haitian President Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier for her articles on Haiti.\n\nDuring her years covering the White House, Dunnigan suffered many of the racial indignities of the time, but also earned a reputation as a hard-hitting reporter. She was barred from entering certain establishments to cover President Eisenhower, and had to sit with the servants to cover Senator Taft's funeral. When she attended formal White House functions, she was mistaken for the wife of a visiting dignitary; no one could imagine a black woman attending such an event on her own. During Eisenhower's two administrations, the president resorted first to not calling on her and later to asking for her questions beforehand because she was known to ask such difficult questions, often about race. No other member of the press corps was required to submit their questions before a press conference, and Dunnigan refused. When Kennedy took office, he welcomed Dunnigan's tough questions and answered them frankly.\n\nIn 1960 Dunnigan left her seat in the press galleries to take a position on [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s campaign for the Democratic nomination. [[John F. Kennedy]] won the nomination, but chose Johnson as his running mate and named Dunnigan education consultant of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. She remained with the committee until 1965. Between 1966 and 1967 she worked as an information specialist for the Department of Labor and then as an editorial assistant for the President's Council of Youth Opportunity. When [[Richard M. Nixon]] took over the presidency in 1968, Dunnigan, as well as the rest of the Democratic administration, found themselves on their way out of the White House to make way for Nixon's Republican team.\n\nAfter her White House days, Dunnigan returned to writing, this time about herself. Her autobiography, ''A Black Woman's Experience: From Schoolhouse to White House'', was published in 1974. As its title indicates, the book is an exploration of Dunnigan's life from her childhood in rural Kentucky to her pioneering work both covering the White House and inside it. A new annotated edition of her 1974 autobiography was released in February 2015.

Dunnigan was the first black female member of the Senate and House of Representatives press galleries (1947), and the first black female White House correspondent in 1948.<ref name=\"MARBL\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\nDunnigan reported on Congressional hearings where blacks were referred to as \"niggers,\" was barred from covering a speech by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in a whites-only theater, and was not allowed to sit with the press to cover Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]'s funeral \u2014 she covered the event from a seat in the servant's section. Dunnigan was known for her straight-shooting reporting style. Politicians routinely avoided answering her difficult questions, which often involved race issues.\n\nDunnigan's career in journalism began at the age of 13, when she started writing one-sentence news items for the local Owensboro Enterprise newspaper. She completed the ten years available to blacks in the segregated Russellville school system, but her parents saw no benefit in allowing their daughter to continue her education. A Sunday school teacher intervened, and Dunnigan was allowed to attend college. By the time she had reached college, Dunnigan had set her sights on becoming a teacher, and completed the teaching course at what is now Kentucky State University. Dunnigan was a teacher in Kentucky public schools from 1924 to 1942. A four-year marriage to Walter Dickenson of Mount Pisgeh ended in divorce in 1930. She married Charles Dunnigan, a childhood friend, on January 8, 1932. The couple had one child, Robert William, and separated in 1953.\n\nAs a young teacher in the segregated Todd County School system, Dunnigan taught courses in Kentucky history. She quickly learned that her students were almost completely ignorant of the historic contributions of African Americans to the state of Kentucky. She started preparing \"Kentucky Fact Sheets\" and handing them out to her students as supplements to the required text. These papers were collected for publication in 1939, but no publisher was willing to take them to press. Associated Publishers Inc. finally published the articles in 1982 as ''The Fascinating Story of Black Kentuckians: Their Heritage and Tradition''. The meager pay she earned teaching forced her to work numerous menial jobs during the summer months, when school was not in session. She washed the tombstones in the white cemetery while working four hours a day in a dairy, cleaning house for a family, and doing washing at night for another family, earning a total of about seven dollars a week.\n\nA call for government workers went out in 1942, and Dunnigan moved to Washington, D.C., during World War II seeking better pay and a government job. She worked as a federal government employee from 1942 to 1946, and took a year of night courses at [[Howard University]]. In 1946 she was offered a job writing for ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' as a Washington correspondent. ''The Defender'' was a black-owned weekly that did not use the words \"Negro\" or \"black\" in its pages. Instead, African Americans were referred to as \"the Race\" and black men and women as \"Race men and Race women.\" Unsure of Dunnigan's abilities, the editor of ''The Defender'' paid her much less than her male counterparts until she could prove her worth. She supplemented her income with other writing jobs.\n\nAs a writer for the Associated Negro Press news service, Dunnigan sought press credentials to cover Congress and the Senate. The Standing Committee of Correspondents (newspaper reporters who ran the congressional press galleries) denied her request on the grounds that she was writing for a weekly newspaper, and reporters covering the U.S. Capitol were required to write for daily publications. Six months later, however, she was granted press clearance, becoming the first African-American woman to gain accreditation. In 1947 she was named bureau chief of the Associate Negro Press, a position she held for 14 years.\n[[File:Alice Alice Dunnigan statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of first African American woman to be admitted to White House press corps]]\nIn 1948 Dunnigan was one of three African Americans and one of two women in the press corps that followed President Harry S. Truman's Western campaign, paying her own way to do it. Also that year, she became the first African-American female White House correspondent, and was the first black woman elected to the Women's National Press Club. Her association with this and other organizations allowed her to travel extensively in the United States and to Canada, Israel, South America, Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean. She was honored by Haitian President Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier for her articles on Haiti.\n\nDuring her years covering the White House, Dunnigan suffered many of the racial indignities of the time, but also earned a reputation as a hard-hitting reporter. She was barred from entering certain establishments to cover President Eisenhower, and had to sit with the servants to cover Senator Taft's funeral. When she attended formal White House functions, she was mistaken for the wife of a visiting dignitary; no one could imagine a black woman attending such an event on her own. During Eisenhower's two administrations, the president resorted first to not calling on her and later to asking for her questions beforehand because she was known to ask such difficult questions, often about race. No other member of the press corps was required to submit their questions before a press conference, and Dunnigan refused. When Kennedy took office, he welcomed Dunnigan's tough questions and answered them frankly.\n\nIn 1960 Dunnigan left her seat in the press galleries to take a position on [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s campaign for the Democratic nomination. [[John F. Kennedy]] won the nomination, but chose Johnson as his running mate and named Dunnigan education consultant of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. She remained with the committee until 1965. Between 1966 and 1967 she worked as an information specialist for the Department of Labor and then as an editorial assistant for the President's Council of Youth Opportunity. When [[Richard M. Nixon]] took over the presidency in 1968, Dunnigan, as well as the rest of the Democratic administration, found themselves on their way out of the White House to make way for Nixon's Republican team.\n\nAfter her White House days, Dunnigan returned to writing, this time about herself. Her autobiography, ''A Black Woman's Experience: From Schoolhouse to White House'', was published in 1974. As its title indicates, the book is an exploration of Dunnigan's life from her childhood in rural Kentucky to her pioneering work both covering the White House and inside it. A new annotated edition of her 1974 autobiography was released in February 2015. This version is entitled Alone atop of the Hill: The Autobiography of Alice Dunnigan, Pioneer of the National Black Press.<ref name=\"Columbia Journalism Review\">{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cjr.org/critical_eye/alice_dunnigan_ethel_payne.php|title=Meet the first two African American women in the White House press corps|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=March 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite her extensive work in government and politics, Dunnigan was most proud of her work in journalism, and received more than 50 journalism awards.
