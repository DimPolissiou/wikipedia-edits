He also plays many character roles in the story segments, some of which are in contrast to his more mature persona, which [[Phil Vischer]] called \"my inner [[Fred Rogers|Mr. Rogers]]\".<ref>[http://blog.beliefnet.com/idolchatter/2009/03/from-veggie-to-jelly-a-interview.html ''From Veggie to Jelly: A Interview with Phil Vischer - Idol Chatter''], Interview, March 30, 2009</ref> He first appeared in 1992 in a VeggieTales promo \"Take 38\" and later in 1993 in [[Big Idea Productions|Big Idea]]'s first video, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]]''. In it, he and Larry set the opening format which has largely become a ''VeggieTales'' standard, where a letter is read from a viewer by the duo on a kitchen counter (which serves as a sort of stage). In this show, Bob played himself in the first of the two 15-minute segments titled \"Tales from the Crisper\", comforting a frightened [[Junior Asparagus]] with the cheerful song, \"God is Bigger.\" The end of this episode started a running gag in which Bob is annoyed by the \"What We Have Learned\" end-of-episode song, impatiently waiting until it is over so that he can ask [[List of VeggieTales characters#Qwerty|Qwerty]] what they've learned. Bob also has his own Silly Song called Lance the Turtle, written by Jean Claude and Phillipe. It premiered in ''Gideon Tuba Warrior'' while Larry was in his pirate persona hosting the show with Pa Grape and Mr. Lunt.\n\nBob the Tomato is voiced by [[Phil Vischer]].\n\n===Larry the Cucumber===\n\nLarry the Cucumber (introduced 1993) partners with his best friend Bob as the wacky companion hosting the videos. In the pre-2015 theme song, he plays a [[sousaphone]] while Bob and other characters sing it. Larry is often cast as the central character in videos with one of his central roles as the host of the short, recurring musical segment entitled ''[[Silly Songs with Larry]]'', in which Larry performs humorous musical numbers of various styles and content. The Silly Song segment, typically placed in the middle of the video, immediately became a very popular staple of ''VeggieTales'' entertainment. Larry also has several other recurring roles including: \"Minnesota Cuke\" (a parody of ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]''), \"Elliot\"/\"Buccaneer Larry\", one of [[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]], and the comical \"superhero\" [[LarryBoy]] in both computer-animated and flash animated adventures. In 2002, Larry was also the star of his own short-lived animated series, ''[[Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures]]''.\n\nLarry was first created by Vischer as a chocolate bar, but then a cucumber, due to Vischer's wife suggesting that parents would not think videos of a chocolate bar would be too good for children\u2013 due to reasons of healthy eating habits.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOl5-Bo0oJwC&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Me, Myself, and Bob: A True Story about Dreams, God, and Talking Vegetables|last=Vischer|first=Phil|date=February 2008|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|year=|isbn=978-1-59555-122-1|location=|pages=63|language=en}}</ref> The now-cucumber Larry was then used to make a 20-second animation test called \"Mr. Cuke's Screen Test\" in 1991, which inspired Vischer and [[Mike Nawrocki]] to create VeggieTales. Larry's on-screen debut was in Big Idea's first video, ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' In this first episode, he was the source of most of the jokes, including physical gags and silly dialogue. The video also featured the first Silly Song in which Larry wore an oversized cowboy hat and sang \"The Water Buffalo Song.\" Larry is the only character to have made an appearance in every single VeggieTales episode (to date).\n\nOne of the most notable differences between the Larry of ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' and later videos is the range of his voice. While Nawrocki has always performed Larry's voice, early shows were voiced with a broad vocal range, from Nawrocki's natural tenor to well above. Starting with ''[[Are You My Neighbor?]]'', that range was limited in scope to the upper range and included a slight lisp, giving Larry a more youthful and sillier sound. Gradually, Larry's speech became more normal, at about the time of the making of the video ''[[King George and the Ducky]]''.\n\nLarry is one of the only Veggies to have spoken about, and to have been seen with his family. He talks about his Aunt Ruth in ''[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]'s'' Silly Song, \"I Love My Lips\" and about a cousin in ''[[Josh and the Big Wall]]'s'' Silly Song, \"The Song of the [[Zebu|Cebu]]\". In ''[[Duke and the Great Pie War]]'', he introduces his three brothers, named Bob, Mark, and Steve, who perform the \"What We Have Learned\" song.\n\nLarry the Cucumber is voiced by [[Mike Nawrocki]].\n\n===Junior Asparagus===\n\nJunior Asparagus (introduced 1993) is one of the co-stars of the [[VeggieTales]] series and is a 5-year-old typical child. Junior has taken a lead role in several videos, including ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'', ''[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]'', ''[[Lyle the Kindly Viking]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Beans]]''. He is also a member of the [[boy band]] \"[[Boyz in the Sink]]\", along with Larry, Mr. Lunt, and Jimmy Gourd, which have appeared in several Silly Songs. Junior is also seen at various times with his parents, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad and Mom Asparagus|Dad and Mom Asparagus]].\n\nIn the initial episodes, Junior was as much a main character as Bob or Larry, having a starring role in at least one segment in every episode - even appearing alongside Bob on the sink counter (in place of Larry) in ''[[Josh and the Big Wall]]'' and ''[[Abe and the Amazing Promise]]''. As the series has evolved, his role has become less pronounced such that ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]'' would become the first episode in which Junior did not make an appearance. However, Junior continues to be featured prominently with leading roles in such movies as ''[[Pistachio \u2013 The Little Boy That Woodn't]]'' and ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#The Little Drummer Boy (2011)|The Little Drummer Boy]]''.\n\nJunior Asparagus is voiced by Lisa Vischer (the wife of Phil Vischer) in the video releases and the 2019 series \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\", and by [[Tress MacNeille]] in the [[VeggieTales in the House|''VeggieTales in the House'' series]].\n\n===Archibald Asparagus===\nArchibald Asparagus (introduced 1993) appears in a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] role of a stuffy classically-educated \"adult\" contrasting with the rest of his co-stars. Archibald has a monocle, a red bowtie, and an [[Received Pronunciation|Oxford English]] accent.\n\nArchibald first appeared in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'', where he played King Darius in the ''Daniel and the Lion's Den'' segment. This episode also coined his on-going dialogue with Larry the Cucumber about his Silly Songs being \"too silly\". He has also appeared in other ''Silly Songs'' including singing ''[[Huckleberry Larry|The Biscuit of Zazzamarandabo]]''. Archibald has a recurring role as LarryBoy's butler (named \"Alfred\" in the video series and kept as \"Archibald\" in the cartoon series) and was featured as the title character in ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''. He also has his own Silly Song called \"Astonishing Wigs\", in ''Princess and the Popstar''. He also makes an appearance in Jean Claude and Phillipe's Silly Song \"Hopperena\" in ''Twas the Night Before Easter''. Archibald is also the narrator for The Good Egg of Gooseville segment of ''The Little House that Stood'', and Larry's High Silk Hat from ''Lyle the Kindly Viking''.\n\nArchibald Asparagus is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Laura Carrot===\nLaura Carrot (introduced 1995) is a 6-year-old carrot and is Junior's best friend. She first appeared in ''[[Are You My Neighbor?]]'' as a background character and got her first major role in ''[[Rack, Shack and Benny]]''. She is usually used when there is a child female lead playing the title characters. For example, in ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#Princess and the Popstar (2011)|Princess and the Popstar]]'', she is the star, and Miriam in the ''Babysitter in De-Nile'' segment of ''Duke and the Great Pie War''.\n\nLaura Carrot has been voiced by Kristin Blegen, Megan Murphy, and Keri Pisapia in the videos, [[Tress MacNeille]] in the ''VeggieTales in the House'' series, and [[Kira Buckland]] in the 2019 series, \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\n===Mr. Lunt===\nMr. Lunt (introduced 1995) is a decorative gourd<ref>http://www.philvischer.com/ask-phil/</ref> with a Spanish accent who grew up in [[New Jersey]]. He often appears as Mr. Nezzer's assistant and the two were introduced in ''[[Rack, Shack & Benny]]''. The pair are also typically used as the video's \"bad guys\" in early ''VeggieTales'' episodes, and has appeared as an individual bad guy as Haman in ''Esther... the Girl Who Became Queen'' and Otis the Elevated in ''Duke and the Great Pie War''. As Otis the Elevated, Mr. Lunt and Mr. Nezzer's roles are reversed with Mr. Nezzer playing the sidekick to Mr. Lunt. Mr. Lunt appears as Pirate Lunt/Sedgewick, one of \"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\", and as a member of the boy band, the \"Boyz in the Sink\". In addition to his \"Boyz\" songs, Mr. Lunt has gotten two of his own ''Silly Songs'' (\"His Cheeseburger\" & \"Donuts for Benny\"). A notable character feature is Mr. Lunt's lack of eyes forcing the use of a hat brim or his eyebrows for expression. He also has a gold tooth, and is constantly seen with a fedora.\n\nMr. Lunt is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Jimmy and Jerry Gourd===\nJimmy Gourd and Jerry Gourd (introduced 1995) are gourd brothers who appear as a secondary comic duo. While Bob and Larry can be considered animated versions of Abbott and Costello, Jimmy the orange gourd and Jerry the yellow gourd might more closely resemble [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]. The pair debuted together in ''[[Are You My Neighbor?]]'' which established that they love to eat. Jimmy is a reoccurring member of the boy band \"Boyz in the Sink\". Jerry appeared with Mr. Lunt in the Love Song \"His Cheeseburger\" furthering his reputation as loving to eat. Alongside Mr. Lunt, Jimmy did musical commentary in ''[[Sweetpea Beauty: A Girl After God's Own Heart]]''.\n\nJimmy and Jerry Gourd are voiced respectively by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki.\n\n===Madame Blueberry===\nMadame Blueberry (introduced 1998) is a blueberry with a French accent who first appeared as the title character in ''Madame Blueberry''. Her name and the theme of this video are both obvious allusions to the tale of [[Madame Bovary]] and as such Madame Blueberry was early on cast as a vain character. Although a blueberry, she is similar in size to Bob the Tomato and slightly larger than the similarly-sized-in-real-life French Peas. Madame Blueberry has a reoccurring role as the Mayor of Bumblyburg in the ''Larry-Boy'' videos.\n\nMadame Blueberry was voiced in the direct-to-video series by Megan Moore Burns in 1998, by Gail Bock from 1999-2002, by Jackie Ritz from 2002-2009, and Megan Murphy from 2005 to the present. She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] in the ''VeggieTales in the House'' series, and is voiced by Stephanie Southerland in the 2019 series, \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\n===Petunia Rhubarb===\nPetunia Rhubarb (introduced 2005) is a red-headed rhubarb who is often seen with Larry as his love interest or female co-star. Her first appearance was in ''Duke and the Great Pie War'' playing the part of Princess Petunia, the scorned \"[[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]]\" figure waiting to be redeemed by Larry's \"[[Boaz]]\". Petunia has a reoccurring role in the ''LarryBoy'' videos and has also sung alongside Larry in the Silly Song, \"Where Have All The Staplers Gone?\" on the video ''[[Pistachio - The Little Boy That Woodn't]]''. Petunia was created after the animators decided to never use Queen Esther again because her hair was too difficult to animate.\n\nPetunia Rhubarb is voiced by Cydney Trent for the direct-to-video series, by [[Tress MacNeille]] in ''VeggieTales in the House series'', and by [[Kira Buckland]] in the 2019 series, \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\n===Pa Grape===\nPa Grape (introduced 1994) is an elderly grape with glasses and a [[Yiddish]] accent. Pa made his first appearance in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' as the father of the \"Grapes of Wrath.\" Pa Grape has a reoccurring role as the captain of the \"Pirates Who Don't Do Anything,\" appearing alongside Larry and Mr. Lunt. Pa Grape is typically cast as a wise, fatherly figure such as Jesse in ''Dave and the Giant Pickle'', Jacob in ''The Ballad of Little Joe'', Mordecai in ''Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen'' and the angel sent to guide Gideon in ''Gideon: Tuba Warrior''.\n\nAccording to his interview with the \"What's the Big Idea?\" magazine, Pa Grape was held back in the 2nd grade for 13 years and got worried about certain things that required sight because he didn't have eyes.<ref name=\"Interview with Pa Grape\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bigidea.com/kids/WTBI_Online/pagrape_interview.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128104835/http://www.bigidea.com/kids/WTBI_Online/pagrape_interview.asp |archive-date=1999-01-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPa Grape is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Mr. Nezzer===\nMr. Nezzer (introduced 1995) is a [[zucchini]] who made his debut in ''Rack, Shack & Benny'' as \"Nebby K. Nezzer\" an allusion to [[Nebuchadnezzar]], the King of [[Babylon]] and the owner of a chocolate factory who creates an idol that he wants everyone to worship. In ''[[The Toy That Saved Christmas]]'', Mr. Nezzer plays Nebby's brother \"Wally P. Nezzer\", again with sidekick and chief trouble-maker Mr. Lunt. However in ''Duke and the Great Pie War'', Mr. Nezzer plays the role of the sidekick, with Mr. Lunt taking the lead. In ''[[The Star of Christmas]]'' and ''[[An Easter Carol]]'', he is \"Ebenezer Nezzer\" (an allusion to [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]) who owns a theater and an Easter Egg factory respectively. In addition to his roles, Mr. Nezzer usually appears as the leader in ''VeggieTales'' videos such as his role as the [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes of Persia]] character in ''Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen'', Olaf the lead Viking in ''Lyle the Kindly Viking'', and the Mayor of Dodgeball City in ''The Ballad of Little Joe'' and ''[[Moe and the Big Exit]]''.\n\nHe didn't appear in ''[[VeggieTales in the House]]'' or ''[[VeggieTales in the City]]'', because  [[Dreamworks Animation|DreamWorks]] felt Mr. Nezzer was African-American and, due to their policy restricting African-American characters being portrayed by white voice actors, had replaced the character with a similar-looking character Ichabeezer. Mr. Nezzar returned in \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\" as the owner of a theater.<ref>{{Citation|last=VeggieTales Official|title=VeggieTales is Back: Brand New VeggieTales Show Trailer|date=2019-04-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6RF9XIGyhg&t=18s|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMr. Nezzer is voiced by [[Phil Vischer]] in the direct-to-video series and by [[David Mann (actor)|David Mann]] in the 2019 series, ''[[The VeggieTales Show]]''.\n\n===The French Peas===\nHeaded by Jean-Claude and Phillipe, the French Peas (introduced 1996) are a group of [[Monty Python|Monty Python-esque]] green peas with broken French accents who debuted playing the [[Philistine]]s in ''Dave and the Giant Pickle''. The Peas were then shrunk to a regular pea size, albeit agitating ones as opposed to menacing. Like the French soldiers in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', the French Peas often torment passersby with strange, nonsensical threats, as seen in ''Josh and the Big Wall!'', which fits their overall yapping little dog personas. The pair narrate the episode ''Madame Blueberry'', calling it a French folk tale. The French Peas should not be confused with the more ordinary peas ([[List of VeggieTales characters#The Peas|see below]]) who frequently appear as background characters. Phillipe and Jean-Claude also have another brother, Christophe, who appears infrequently. They also have their own Silly Song \"Hopperena\" in ''Twas the Night Before Easter''.\n\nJean-Claude and Philippe are voiced respectively by Mike Nawrocki and Phil Vischer. Christophe is voiced by Chris Olsen, a Big Idea animator until 1998. Numerous other voice actors have played other French Peas including animator Brian K. Roberts.\n\n===Qwerty===\nQwerty (introduced 1993) is the desktop computer seen on the kitchen counter which Bob and Larry use to read the Bible verse at the end of each show. Qwerty's name is derived from the first six letters that appear on a standard [[QWERTY|English keyboard]]. Though Qwerty is not alive [[List of Latin phrases (P)|per se]], it does have certain [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characteristics, including responsory noises and voice activation. In (almost) every episode, Bob says \"We're over here by Qwerty to talk about what we learned today...\" to which voices start to sing the \"What We Learned Today\" song. Qwerty is not always perfect as in the first episode \"Where's God When I'm S-Scared?\" when it accidentally posts a meatloaf recipe rather than a Bible verse.\n\nAccording to Phil Vischer, the original design for Qwerty was an [[Intel 80386]] model computer. Qwerty was slightly updated in ''Abe and the Amazing Promise'', giving two verses instead of one, and got a more \"life-changing\" update in the episode ''Pistachio - The Little Boy That Woodn't'' when it got a voice. The design of the new update, including a black screen instead of the original blue, is reminiscent of an Apple iMac.\n\nQwerty is voiced by [[Mike Nawrocki]].\n\n==Secondary characters==\n===The Scallions===\nThe Scallions (introduced 1993) are a trio of often devious green onions who are led by their tallest member simply called Scallion #1. They are among the most consistent antagonists in ''VeggieTales''. They debuted as the Wisemen opposite Larry's \"Daniel\" in the second act of the video ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' (Daniel and the Lions' Den) and later appeared in ''Are You My Neighbor?'' as a trio of bandits that rob Larry in \"The Story of Flibber-O-Loo\" and as the band of bandits who kidnap Little Joe and take him to Dodge Ball City in ''The Ballad of Little Joe''. In the Silly Songs \"The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps\", \"Listen\", and \"A Helping Hand\", they along with Frankencelery perform as a barbershop quartet that narrates the songs. Occasionally, one of the Scallions will make a solo appearance. For example, Scallion #1 appeared as a salesman selling the \"Forgive-O-Matic\" device in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' and as the Englishman/Cedric in ''King George and the Ducky'', and Scallion #3 appeared as the Milk Money Bandit in ''LarryBoy and the Rumor Weed''. None of the Scallions have actual names, which Scallion #1 laments at the end of the Silly Song \"Larry's High Silk Hat\" from ''[[Lyle the Kindly Viking]]'' (\"I've been around since show one and I still don't have a name\").\n\nScallion #1 is voiced by Phil Vischer, Scallion #2 is voiced by Mike Nawrocki, and Scallion #3 has been voiced by Mike Sage, Brian K. Roberts, and Mike Nawrocki.\n\n===Dad and Mom Asparagus===\nJunior's father, Dad Asparagus, (introduced 1993) first appeared in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?''. He often appears opposite Junior whenever a video requires a father figure. Dad Asparagus is also an astronaut. Seen less often, Junior's Mother, Mom Asparagus (introduced 1993), appears in the traditional mother role supporting Junior and also debuted in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' Dad and Mom Asparagus are also seen together as Reverend Gilbert and his wife alongside Junior in ''An Easter Carol''. They also make individual appearances, Mom as Shack's Mom in ''Rack Shack and Benny'', and Dad Asparagus as himself and the Professor in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' among others.\n\nDad Asparagus is voiced by Dan Anderson and by Rob Paulsen in ''VeggieTales in the House'' and ''VeggieTales in the City''.\n\nMom Asparagus has been voiced at various times by G. Bock, Pamela Thomas and Lisa Vischer in the videos and by Tress MacNeille from the ''VeggieTales in the House'' series.\n\n===Scooter===\nScooter (introduced 1995), a [[carrot]] with a Scottish accent, first appeared as the engineer of the \"USS Applepies\" (a spoof of [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] from the original [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]] television series) in \"The Gourds Must Be Crazy\" section of ''Are You My Neighbor?'' Scooter is seen as an Israelite in ''Josh and the Big Wall!'' and as Horatio the baker in the Omelet segment of ''Lyle the Kindly Viking'' and has a recurring role as a police officer in the ''LarryBoy'' episodes. He returned as the USS Applepies' engineer in the video ''Veggies In Space: The Fennel Frontier''. \n\nScooter is voiced by Jim Poole.\n\n===Mabel and Penelope===\nMabel and Penelope (introduced 1993) are a [[pear]] and an [[asparagus]] respectively. The pair's first appearance was in ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]]'' as [[Book of Daniel#Identity of \"Darius the Mede\"|King Darius]]'s maidservants. The pair is frequently seen together as secondary female characters such as wives to Mr. Nezzer and Jimmy Gourd in ''Lyle, The Kindly Viking''.\n \nMabel and Penelope are voiced respectively by Pamela Thomas and Gail Bock.\n\n===Phil Winkelstein===\nPhil Winkelstein (introduced 1993) first appears in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' as Frankencelery, a character in a veggie [[horror film]] of the same name. Hailing from [[Toledo, Ohio]], Winkelstein is a mild-mannered [[celery]] stalk with a high-pitched voice who resembles the classic [[Frankenstein's monster]], purple eyelids, cervical [[electrode]]s, black hair, and a [[unibrow]], outside of his acting career. Winkelstein also sings the bass part of the [[barbershop quartet]] with the Scallions in ''[[The End of Silliness?|The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps]]'', \"Listen\" from \"Larry Learns to Listen\", and \"A Helping Hand\" from \"Bob Lends a Helping Hand\". He also appeared as a background citizen of Bumblyburg in ''Larry-Boy and the Fib from Outer Space!''.\n\nPhil Winkelstein is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===The Green Onions===\nThe Green Onions (introduced between 1996) consist of daughter Annie, her two parents, and Grandpa George. Grandpa George was the first Green [[Onion]] to be seen and made his debut in ''Rack, Shack, and Benny'' as the chocolate factory's security guard as well as the episode narrator and has similar reoccurring roles as a narrator of ''VeggieTales'' episodes. Annie first appeared in ''The Toy That Saved Christmas'', alongside Grandpa George who appears as a postman, and it is revealed that they are related. Annie's parents first appeared, alongside Annie, in ''Madame Blueberry'' playing poor French green onions. Annie also appeared alongside Larry on the sink counter along with Petunia, and in place of Bob, in ''Sweetpea Beauty''. \n \nAnnie Onion has been voiced by Shelby Vischer, Phil Vischer's daughter, Allie Nawrocki, Mike Nawrocki's daughter, and is currently voiced by Maggie Roberts, Brian Roberts's daughter. Annie's parents are voiced by Phil and Lisa Vischer . Grandpa George is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Miss Achmetha===\nMiss Achmetha (introduced 2000) is a green onion who made her first appearance singing the song ''Lost Puppies'' in ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]''. Miss Achmetha is known for her constantly twitching eye, her somewhat confused or annoyed demeanor, and her accordion, which she sometimes plays during her singing roles. She also appears in speaking and non-speaking parts in Silly Songs including \"SUV\", \"Larry's High Silk Hat\" and \"Bellybutton\".\n\nMiss Achmetha is voiced by Charlotte Jackson and Marin Miller.\n\n===Khalil===\nKhalil (introduced 2002) is a [[caterpillar]] with an [[India|Indian accent]] who first appeared in ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' as a rug salesman and foil/conscience to Jonah. He was then heard to voice Lutfi in the fanciful \"flannel-graph\" of [[Saint Patrick]], the opening element of the episode ''[[Sumo of the Opera]]''. He was also the secondary character in the video ''Pistachio''. He also has a reoccurring role in the \"Boyz in the Sink\" Silly Songs. Khalil returns in the series ''[[The VeggieTales Show]]'' and plays music in the orchestra pit.\n\nKhalil is voiced by Tim Hodge.\n\n===Ichabeezer===\nIchabeezer (introduced 2014) is the grumpy [[zucchini]] neighbor to Bob and Larry in the ''[[VeggieTales in the House]]'' and ''[[VeggieTales in the City]]'' series on [[Netflix]]. Ichabeezer is used on the Netflix series in essentially the same manner as Mr. Nezzer is in the video series - as either the gruff, semi-villain or as the vaguely simple-minded authority figure in the stories.\n\nIchabeezer is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n\n==Minor characters==\n===Archibald's Wife===\n'''Archibald's Wife''' (introduced 1994) is an [[asparagus]] like her husband and first appeared in ''[[God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!|Larry's Lagoon]]'' as \"'''Lovey'''\" (with Archibald and his wife as a clear allusion to Mr. and Mrs. Howell from [[Gilligan's Island]]). She returned soon after as the Flibbian doctor in ''[[Are You My Neighbor?|The Story of Flibber-O-Loo]]''. She is usually cast alongside Archibald in a supporting role and is differentiated from Mom Asparagus by a longer nose and a British accent similar to Archibald's.\n\nArchibald's Wife is voiced by G. Bock.\n\n===The Peas===\nNot to be confused with the French Peas, '''the Peas''' (introduced 1995) consist of '''Percy Pea''', '''Li'l Pea''', and other [[pea]]s that are only seen in a group of other Veggies as background characters. The Peas first appear as background characters in ''Rack, Shack, and Benny''. They also star as the monks alongside Pa Grape in ''Lyle the Kindly Viking''. In ''Dave and the Giant Pickle'' and ''Josh and the Big Wall'', Percy and other peas appear as the Israelites. The entire family is seen in ''The Toy That Saved Christmas'' where Percy and Li'l Pea receive their first speaking parts. Percy and Li'l Pea see their largest roles in ''Larry-Boy! And the Fib from Outer Space!'', ''Larry-Boy and the Rumor Weed'' and \"Bully Trouble\" (from ''Minnesota Cuke and the Search of Sampson's Hairbrush'').\n\nPhil Vischer voices Percy Pea. Leslie Benodin (1996\u20131999) and Mike Nawrocki voice Li'l Pea (1999\u2013present).\n\n===Grandma Gourd===\n'''Grandma Gourd''' (introduced 2004) is a yellow [[gourd]] who has appeared in several episodes as a minor/background character. Grandma Gourd first appeared in ''Sumo of the Opera'' as a woman beating the Italian Scallion (Larry the Cucumber) over the head with her cane and had several other non-speaking roles in subsequent episodes. Her roles became slightly larger starting in 2010 with a minor speaking part in ''Pistachio - The Little Boy That Woodn't'' as a bookseller, as Mrs. Josephson in ''It's a Meaningful Life'', as Miss Lewis in ''[[Robin Good and The Not-So-Merry Men]]'' and as Old Mother Hubbard ([[Goldilocks]] (Laura Carrot)'s mother) in \"The Good Egg of Gooseville\" portion of the ''Little House That Stood''.\n\nGrandma Gourd is voiced by Keri Pisapia.\n\n===Ma Grape===\n'''Ma Grape''' (introduced 1994) is a [[grape]] with a Southern accent and Pa Grape's wife. Ma Grape made his first appearance in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' along with the rest of her family. She has since appeared in some episodes from the late 2000s to the early 2010s, including as Jetro's Wife in ''Moe and the Big Exit'', and as Sarah in ''Abe and the Amazing Promise''. \n\nMa Grape was voiced by Heidi Landis in her debut episode, and another different actress in some of the later episodes of the original series.\n\n===Tom Grape===\n'''Tom Grape''' (introduced 1994) is a [[grape]] with a Southern accent and Pa Grape's son. Tom made his first appearance in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' along with the rest of his family. His only other appearances have been in ''Dave and the Giant Pickle'' and ''Josh and the Big Wall'', both times alongside his father, Pa Grape.\n\nTom Grape is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Charlie Pincher===\n'''Charlie Pincher''' (introduced 2002) is an old [[scallion]] who first appeared in ''The Star of Christmas'' and is frequently cast as a hermit or oddball character, along with having a [[cockney accent]]. He has appeared in such videos as ''The Ballad of Little Joe'', ''Lord of the Beans'', ''Moe and the Big Exit'' and ''Abe and the Amazing Promise''.\n\nCharlie Pincher is voiced by Tim Hodge.\n\n===The Peach===\n'''The Peach''' (introduced 1995) first appears in the Silly Song ''[[Are You My Neighbor?|The Hairbrush Song]]'' and appears to have no actual name as he is only ever referred to by the rest of the cast as \"the peach\". He later appeared in the ''Oh, Santa!'' Silly Song in which he played an [[IRS]] agent. The running joke about the Peach is that he, unlike most of the other characters, has hair. He was thus the obvious choice to play Samson in ''Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush'', however, he is seen only in still pictures throughout the episode.

He also plays many character roles in the story segments, some of which are in contrast to his more mature persona, which [[Phil Vischer]] called \"my inner [[Fred Rogers|Mr. Rogers]]\".<ref>[http://blog.beliefnet.com/idolchatter/2009/03/from-veggie-to-jelly-a-interview.html ''From Veggie to Jelly: A Interview with Phil Vischer - Idol Chatter''], Interview, March 30, 2009</ref> He first appeared in 1992 in a VeggieTales promo \"Take 38\" and later in 1993 in [[Big Idea Productions|Big Idea]]'s first video, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]]''. In it, he and Larry set the opening format which has largely become a ''VeggieTales'' standard, where a letter is read from a viewer by the duo on a kitchen counter (which serves as a sort of stage). In this show, Bob played himself in the first of the two 15-minute segments titled \"Tales from the Crisper\", comforting a frightened [[Junior Asparagus]] with the cheerful song, \"God is Bigger.\" The end of this episode started a running gag in which Bob is annoyed by the \"What We Have Learned\" end-of-episode song, impatiently waiting until it is over so that he can ask [[List of VeggieTales characters#Qwerty|Qwerty]] what they've learned. Bob also has his own Silly Song called Lance the Turtle, written by Jean Claude and Phillipe. It premiered in ''Gideon Tuba Warrior'' while Larry was in his pirate persona hosting the show with Pa Grape and Mr. Lunt.\n\nBob the Tomato is voiced by [[Phil Vischer]].\n\n===Larry the Cucumber===\n\nLarry the Cucumber (introduced 1993) partners with his best friend Bob as the wacky companion hosting the videos. In the pre-2015 theme song, he plays a [[sousaphone]] while Bob and other characters sing it. Larry is often cast as the central character in videos with one of his central roles as the host of the short, recurring musical segment entitled ''[[Silly Songs with Larry]]'', in which Larry performs humorous musical numbers of various styles and content. The Silly Song segment, typically placed in the middle of the video, immediately became a very popular staple of ''VeggieTales'' entertainment. Larry also has several other recurring roles including: \"Minnesota Cuke\" (a parody of ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]''), \"Elliot\"/\"Buccaneer Larry\", one of [[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]], and the comical \"superhero\" [[LarryBoy]] in both computer-animated and flash animated adventures. In 2002, Larry was also the star of his own short-lived animated series, ''[[Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures]]''.\n\nLarry was first created by Vischer as a chocolate bar, but then a cucumber, due to Vischer's wife suggesting that parents would not think videos of a chocolate bar would be too good for children\u2013 due to reasons of healthy eating habits.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOl5-Bo0oJwC&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Me, Myself, and Bob: A True Story about Dreams, God, and Talking Vegetables|last=Vischer|first=Phil|date=February 2008|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|year=|isbn=978-1-59555-122-1|location=|pages=63|language=en}}</ref> The now-cucumber Larry was then used to make a 20-second animation test called \"Mr. Cuke's Screen Test\" in 1991, which inspired Vischer and [[Mike Nawrocki]] to create VeggieTales. Larry's on-screen debut was in Big Idea's first video, ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' In this first episode, he was the source of most of the jokes, including physical gags and silly dialogue. The video also featured the first Silly Song in which Larry wore an oversized cowboy hat and sang \"The Water Buffalo Song.\" Larry is the only character to have made an appearance in every single VeggieTales episode (to date).\n\nOne of the most notable differences between the Larry of ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' and later videos is the range of his voice. While Nawrocki has always performed Larry's voice, early shows were voiced with a broad vocal range, from Nawrocki's natural tenor to well above. Starting with ''[[Are You My Neighbor?]]'', that range was limited in scope to the upper range and included a slight lisp, giving Larry a more youthful and sillier sound. Gradually, Larry's speech became more normal, at about the time of the making of the video ''[[King George and the Ducky]]''.\n\nLarry is one of the only Veggies to have spoken about, and to have been seen with his family. He talks about his Aunt Ruth in ''[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]'s'' Silly Song, \"I Love My Lips\" and about a cousin in ''[[Josh and the Big Wall]]'s'' Silly Song, \"The Song of the [[Zebu|Cebu]]\". In ''[[Duke and the Great Pie War]]'', he introduces his three brothers, named Bob, Mark, and Steve, who perform the \"What We Have Learned\" song.\n\nLarry the Cucumber is voiced by [[Mike Nawrocki]].\n\n===Junior Asparagus===\n\nJunior Asparagus (introduced 1993) is one of the co-stars of the [[VeggieTales]] series and is a 5-year-old typical child. Junior has taken a lead role in several videos, including ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'', ''[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]'', ''[[Lyle the Kindly Viking]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Beans]]''. He is also a member of the [[boy band]] \"[[Boyz in the Sink]]\", along with Larry, Mr. Lunt, and Jimmy Gourd, which have appeared in several Silly Songs. Junior is also seen at various times with his parents, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad and Mom Asparagus|Dad and Mom Asparagus]].\n\nIn the initial episodes, Junior was as much a main character as Bob or Larry, having a starring role in at least one segment in every episode - even appearing alongside Bob on the sink counter (in place of Larry) in ''[[Josh and the Big Wall]]'' and ''[[Abe and the Amazing Promise]]''. As the series has evolved, his role has become less pronounced such that ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]'' would become the first episode in which Junior did not make an appearance. However, Junior continues to be featured prominently with leading roles in such movies as ''[[Pistachio \u2013 The Little Boy That Woodn't]]'' and ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#The Little Drummer Boy (2011)|The Little Drummer Boy]]''.\n\nJunior Asparagus is voiced by Lisa Vischer (the wife of Phil Vischer) in the video releases and the 2019 series \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\", and by [[Tress MacNeille]] in the [[VeggieTales in the House|''VeggieTales in the House'' series]].\n\n===Archibald Asparagus===\nArchibald Asparagus (introduced 1993) appears in a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] role of a stuffy classically-educated \"adult\" contrasting with the rest of his co-stars. Archibald has a monocle, a red bowtie, and an [[Received Pronunciation|Oxford English]] accent.\n\nArchibald first appeared in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'', where he played King Darius in the ''Daniel and the Lion's Den'' segment. This episode also coined his on-going dialogue with Larry the Cucumber about his Silly Songs being \"too silly\". He has also appeared in other ''Silly Songs'' including singing ''[[Huckleberry Larry|The Biscuit of Zazzamarandabo]]''. Archibald has a recurring role as LarryBoy's butler (named \"Alfred\" in the video series and kept as \"Archibald\" in the cartoon series) and was featured as the title character in ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''. He also has his own Silly Song called \"Astonishing Wigs\", in ''Princess and the Popstar''. He also makes an appearance in Jean Claude and Phillipe's Silly Song \"Hopperena\" in ''Twas the Night Before Easter''. Archibald is also the narrator for The Good Egg of Gooseville segment of ''The Little House that Stood'', and Larry's High Silk Hat from ''Lyle the Kindly Viking''.\n\nArchibald Asparagus is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Laura Carrot===\nLaura Carrot (introduced 1995) is a 6-year-old carrot and is Junior's best friend. She first appeared in ''[[Are You My Neighbor?]]'' as a background character and got her first major role in ''[[Rack, Shack and Benny]]''. She is usually used when there is a child female lead playing the title characters. For example, in ''[[List of VeggieTales videos#Princess and the Popstar (2011)|Princess and the Popstar]]'', she is the star, and Miriam in the ''Babysitter in De-Nile'' segment of ''Duke and the Great Pie War''.\n\nLaura Carrot has been voiced by Kristin Blegen, Megan Murphy, and Keri Pisapia in the videos, [[Tress MacNeille]] in the ''VeggieTales in the House'' series, and [[Kira Buckland]] in the 2019 series, \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\n===Mr. Lunt===\nMr. Lunt (introduced 1995) is a decorative gourd<ref>http://www.philvischer.com/ask-phil/</ref> with a Spanish accent who grew up in [[New Jersey]]. He often appears as Mr. Nezzer's assistant and the two were introduced in ''[[Rack, Shack & Benny]]''. The pair are also typically used as the video's \"bad guys\" in early ''VeggieTales'' episodes, and has appeared as an individual bad guy as Haman in ''Esther... the Girl Who Became Queen'' and Otis the Elevated in ''Duke and the Great Pie War''. As Otis the Elevated, Mr. Lunt and Mr. Nezzer's roles are reversed with Mr. Nezzer playing the sidekick to Mr. Lunt. Mr. Lunt appears as Pirate Lunt/Sedgewick, one of \"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\", and as a member of the boy band, the \"Boyz in the Sink\". In addition to his \"Boyz\" songs, Mr. Lunt has gotten two of his own ''Silly Songs'' (\"His Cheeseburger\" & \"Donuts for Benny\"). A notable character feature is Mr. Lunt's lack of eyes forcing the use of a hat brim or his eyebrows for expression. He also has a gold tooth, and is constantly seen with a fedora.\n\nMr. Lunt is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Jimmy and Jerry Gourd===\nJimmy Gourd and Jerry Gourd (introduced 1995) are gourd brothers who appear as a secondary comic duo. While Bob and Larry can be considered animated versions of Abbott and Costello, Jimmy the orange gourd and Jerry the yellow gourd might more closely resemble [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]. The pair debuted together in ''[[Are You My Neighbor?]]'' which established that they love to eat. Jimmy is a reoccurring member of the boy band \"Boyz in the Sink\". Jerry appeared with Mr. Lunt in the Love Song \"His Cheeseburger\" furthering his reputation as loving to eat. Alongside Mr. Lunt, Jimmy did musical commentary in ''[[Sweetpea Beauty: A Girl After God's Own Heart]]''.\n\nJimmy and Jerry Gourd are voiced respectively by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki.\n\n===Madame Blueberry===\nMadame Blueberry (introduced 1998) is a blueberry with a French accent who first appeared as the title character in ''Madame Blueberry''. Her name and the theme of this video are both obvious allusions to the tale of [[Madame Bovary]] and as such Madame Blueberry was early on cast as a vain character. Although a blueberry, she is similar in size to Bob the Tomato and slightly larger than the similarly-sized-in-real-life French Peas. Madame Blueberry has a reoccurring role as the Mayor of Bumblyburg in the ''Larry-Boy'' videos.\n\nMadame Blueberry was voiced in the direct-to-video series by Megan Moore Burns in 1998, by Gail Bock from 1999-2002, by Jackie Ritz from 2002-2009, and Megan Murphy from 2005 to the present. She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] in the ''VeggieTales in the House'' series, and is voiced by Stephanie Southerland in the 2019 series, \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\n===Petunia Rhubarb===\nPetunia Rhubarb (introduced 2005) is a red-headed rhubarb who is often seen with Larry as his love interest or female co-star. Her first appearance was in ''Duke and the Great Pie War'' playing the part of Princess Petunia, the scorned \"[[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]]\" figure waiting to be redeemed by Larry's \"[[Boaz]]\". Petunia has a reoccurring role in the ''LarryBoy'' videos and has also sung alongside Larry in the Silly Song, \"Where Have All The Staplers Gone?\" on the video ''[[Pistachio - The Little Boy That Woodn't]]''. Petunia was created after the animators decided to never use Queen Esther again because her hair was too difficult to animate.\n\nPetunia Rhubarb is voiced by Cydney Trent for the direct-to-video series, by [[Tress MacNeille]] in ''VeggieTales in the House series'', and by [[Kira Buckland]] in the 2019 series, \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\n===Pa Grape===\nPa Grape (introduced 1994) is an elderly grape with glasses and a [[Yiddish]] accent. Pa made his first appearance in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' as the father of the \"Grapes of Wrath.\" Pa Grape has a reoccurring role as the captain of the \"Pirates Who Don't Do Anything,\" appearing alongside Larry and Mr. Lunt. Pa Grape is typically cast as a wise, fatherly figure such as Jesse in ''Dave and the Giant Pickle'', Jacob in ''The Ballad of Little Joe'', Mordecai in ''Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen'' and the angel sent to guide Gideon in ''Gideon: Tuba Warrior''.\n\nAccording to his interview with the \"What's the Big Idea?\" magazine, Pa Grape was held back in the 2nd grade for 13 years and got worried about certain things that required sight because he didn't have eyes.<ref name=\"Interview with Pa Grape\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bigidea.com/kids/WTBI_Online/pagrape_interview.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128104835/http://www.bigidea.com/kids/WTBI_Online/pagrape_interview.asp |archive-date=1999-01-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPa Grape is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Mr. Nezzer===\nMr. Nezzer (introduced 1995) is a [[zucchini]] who made his debut in ''Rack, Shack & Benny'' as \"Nebby K. Nezzer\" an allusion to [[Nebuchadnezzar]], the King of [[Babylon]] and the owner of a chocolate factory who creates an idol that he wants everyone to worship. In ''[[The Toy That Saved Christmas]]'', Mr. Nezzer plays Nebby's brother \"Wally P. Nezzer\", again with sidekick and chief trouble-maker Mr. Lunt. However in ''Duke and the Great Pie War'', Mr. Nezzer plays the role of the sidekick, with Mr. Lunt taking the lead. In ''[[The Star of Christmas]]'' and ''[[An Easter Carol]]'', he is \"Ebenezer Nezzer\" (an allusion to [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]) who owns a theater and an Easter Egg factory respectively. In addition to his roles, Mr. Nezzer usually appears as the leader in ''VeggieTales'' videos such as his role as the [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes of Persia]] character in ''Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen'', Olaf the lead Viking in ''Lyle the Kindly Viking'', and the Mayor of Dodgeball City in ''The Ballad of Little Joe'' and ''[[Moe and the Big Exit]]''.\n\nHe didn't appear in ''[[VeggieTales in the House]]'' or ''[[VeggieTales in the City]]'', because  [[Dreamworks Animation|DreamWorks]] felt Mr. Nezzer was African-American and, due to their policy restricting African-American characters being portrayed by white voice actors, had replaced the character with a similar-looking character Ichabeezer. Mr. Nezzar returned in \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\" as the owner of a theater.<ref>{{Citation|last=VeggieTales Official|title=VeggieTales is Back: Brand New VeggieTales Show Trailer|date=2019-04-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6RF9XIGyhg&t=18s|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMr. Nezzer is voiced by [[Phil Vischer]] in the direct-to-video series and by [[David Mann (actor)|David Mann]] in the 2019 series, ''[[The VeggieTales Show]]''.\n\n===The French Peas===\nHeaded by Jean-Claude and Phillipe, the French Peas (introduced 1996) are a group of [[Monty Python|Monty Python-esque]] green peas with broken French accents who debuted playing the [[Philistine]]s in ''Dave and the Giant Pickle''. The Peas were then shrunk to a regular pea size, albeit agitating ones as opposed to menacing. Like the French soldiers in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', the French Peas often torment passersby with strange, nonsensical threats, as seen in ''Josh and the Big Wall!'', which fits their overall yapping little dog personas. The pair narrate the episode ''Madame Blueberry'', calling it a French folk tale. The French Peas should not be confused with the more ordinary peas ([[List of VeggieTales characters#The Peas|see below]]) who frequently appear as background characters. Phillipe and Jean-Claude also have another brother, Christophe, who appears infrequently. They also have their own Silly Song \"Hopperena\" in ''Twas the Night Before Easter''.\n\nJean-Claude and Philippe are voiced respectively by Mike Nawrocki and Phil Vischer. Christophe is voiced by Chris Olsen, a Big Idea animator until 1998. Numerous other voice actors have played other French Peas including animator Brian K. Roberts.\n\n===Qwerty===\nQwerty (introduced 1993) is the desktop computer seen on the kitchen counter which Bob and Larry use to read the Bible verse at the end of each show. Qwerty's name is derived from the first six letters that appear on a standard [[QWERTY|English keyboard]]. Though Qwerty is not alive [[List of Latin phrases (P)|per se]], it does have certain [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characteristics, including responsory noises and voice activation. In (almost) every episode, Bob says \"We're over here by Qwerty to talk about what we learned today...\" to which voices start to sing the \"What We Learned Today\" song. Qwerty is not always perfect as in the first episode \"Where's God When I'm S-Scared?\" when it accidentally posts a meatloaf recipe rather than a Bible verse.\n\nAccording to Phil Vischer, the original design for Qwerty was an [[Intel 80386]] model computer. Qwerty was slightly updated in ''Abe and the Amazing Promise'', giving two verses instead of one, and got a more \"life-changing\" update in the episode ''Pistachio - The Little Boy That Woodn't'' when it got a voice. The design of the new update, including a black screen instead of the original blue, is reminiscent of an Apple iMac.\n\nQwerty is voiced by [[Mike Nawrocki]].\n\n==Secondary characters==\n===The Scallions===\nThe Scallions (introduced 1993) are a trio of often devious green onions who are led by their tallest member simply called Scallion #1. They are among the most consistent antagonists in ''VeggieTales''. They debuted as the Wisemen opposite Larry's \"Daniel\" in the second act of the video ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' (Daniel and the Lions' Den) and later appeared in ''Are You My Neighbor?'' as a trio of bandits that rob Larry in \"The Story of Flibber-O-Loo\" and as the band of bandits who kidnap Little Joe and take him to Dodge Ball City in ''The Ballad of Little Joe''. In the Silly Songs \"The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps\", \"Listen\", and \"A Helping Hand\", they along with Frankencelery perform as a barbershop quartet that narrates the songs. Occasionally, one of the Scallions will make a solo appearance. For example, Scallion #1 appeared as a salesman selling the \"Forgive-O-Matic\" device in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' and as the Englishman/Cedric in ''King George and the Ducky'', and Scallion #3 appeared as the Milk Money Bandit in ''LarryBoy and the Rumor Weed''. None of the Scallions have actual names, which Scallion #1 laments at the end of the Silly Song \"Larry's High Silk Hat\" from ''[[Lyle the Kindly Viking]]'' (\"I've been around since show one and I still don't have a name\").\n\nScallion #1 is voiced by Phil Vischer, Scallion #2 is voiced by Mike Nawrocki, and Scallion #3 has been voiced by Mike Sage, Brian K. Roberts, and Mike Nawrocki.\n\n===Dad and Mom Asparagus===\nJunior's father, Dad Asparagus, (introduced 1993) first appeared in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?''. He often appears opposite Junior whenever a video requires a father figure. Dad Asparagus is also an astronaut. Seen less often, Junior's Mother, Mom Asparagus (introduced 1993), appears in the traditional mother role supporting Junior and also debuted in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' Dad and Mom Asparagus are also seen together as Reverend Gilbert and his wife alongside Junior in ''An Easter Carol''. They also make individual appearances, Mom as Shack's Mom in ''Rack Shack and Benny'', and Dad Asparagus as himself and the Professor in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' among others.\n\nDad Asparagus is voiced by Dan Anderson and by Rob Paulsen in ''VeggieTales in the House'' and ''VeggieTales in the City''.\n\nMom Asparagus has been voiced at various times by G. Bock, Pamela Thomas and Lisa Vischer in the videos and by Tress MacNeille from the ''VeggieTales in the House'' series.\n\n===Scooter===\nScooter (introduced 1995), a [[carrot]] with a Scottish accent, first appeared as the engineer of the \"USS Applepies\" (a spoof of [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] from the original [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]] television series) in \"The Gourds Must Be Crazy\" section of ''Are You My Neighbor?'' Scooter is seen as an Israelite in ''Josh and the Big Wall!'' and as Horatio the baker in the Omelet segment of ''Lyle the Kindly Viking'' and has a recurring role as a police officer in the ''LarryBoy'' episodes. He returned as the USS Applepies' engineer in the video ''Veggies In Space: The Fennel Frontier''. \n\nScooter is voiced by Jim Poole.\n\n===Mabel and Penelope===\nMabel and Penelope (introduced 1993) are a [[pear]] and an [[asparagus]] respectively. The pair's first appearance was in ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]]'' as [[Book of Daniel#Identity of \"Darius the Mede\"|King Darius]]'s maidservants. The pair is frequently seen together as secondary female characters such as wives to Mr. Nezzer and Jimmy Gourd in ''Lyle, The Kindly Viking''.\n \nMabel and Penelope are voiced respectively by Pamela Thomas and Gail Bock.\n\n===Phil Winkelstein===\nPhil Winkelstein (introduced 1993) first appears in ''Where's God When I'm S-Scared?'' as Frankencelery, a character in a veggie [[horror film]] of the same name. Hailing from [[Toledo, Ohio]], Winkelstein is a mild-mannered [[celery]] stalk with a high-pitched voice who resembles the classic [[Frankenstein's monster]], purple eyelids, cervical [[electrode]]s, black hair, and a [[unibrow]], outside of his acting career. Winkelstein also sings the bass part of the [[barbershop quartet]] with the Scallions in ''[[The End of Silliness?|The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps]]'', \"Listen\" from \"Larry Learns to Listen\", and \"A Helping Hand\" from \"Bob Lends a Helping Hand\". He also appeared as a background citizen of Bumblyburg in ''Larry-Boy and the Fib from Outer Space!''.\n\nPhil Winkelstein is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===The Green Onions===\nThe Green Onions (introduced between 1996) consist of daughter Annie, her two parents, and Grandpa George. Grandpa George was the first Green [[Onion]] to be seen and made his debut in ''Rack, Shack, and Benny'' as the chocolate factory's security guard as well as the episode narrator and has similar reoccurring roles as a narrator of ''VeggieTales'' episodes. Annie first appeared in ''The Toy That Saved Christmas'', alongside Grandpa George who appears as a postman, and it is revealed that they are related. Annie's parents first appeared, alongside Annie, in ''Madame Blueberry'' playing poor French green onions. Annie also appeared alongside Larry on the sink counter along with Petunia, and in place of Bob, in ''Sweetpea Beauty''. \n \nAnnie Onion has been voiced by Shelby Vischer, Phil Vischer's daughter, Allie Nawrocki, Mike Nawrocki's daughter, and is currently voiced by Maggie Roberts, Brian Roberts's daughter. Annie's parents are voiced by Phil and Lisa Vischer . Grandpa George is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Miss Achmetha===\nMiss Achmetha (introduced 2000) is a green onion who made her first appearance singing the song ''Lost Puppies'' in ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]''. Miss Achmetha is known for her constantly twitching eye, her somewhat confused or annoyed demeanor, and her accordion, which she sometimes plays during her singing roles. She also appears in speaking and non-speaking parts in Silly Songs including \"SUV\", \"Larry's High Silk Hat\" and \"Bellybutton\".\n\nMiss Achmetha is voiced by Charlotte Jackson and Marin Miller.\n\n===Khalil===\nKhalil (introduced 2002) is a [[caterpillar]] with an [[India|Indian accent]] who first appeared in ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' as a rug salesman and foil/conscience to Jonah. He was then heard to voice Lutfi in the fanciful \"flannel-graph\" of [[Saint Patrick]], the opening element of the episode ''[[Sumo of the Opera]]''. He was also the secondary character in the video ''Pistachio''. He also has a reoccurring role in the \"Boyz in the Sink\" Silly Songs. Khalil returns in the series ''[[The VeggieTales Show]]'' and plays music in the orchestra pit.\n\nKhalil is voiced by Tim Hodge.\n\n===Ichabeezer===\nIchabeezer (introduced 2014) is the grumpy [[zucchini]] neighbor to Bob and Larry in the ''[[VeggieTales in the House]]'' and ''[[VeggieTales in the City]]'' series on [[Netflix]]. Ichabeezer is used on the Netflix series in essentially the same manner as Mr. Nezzer is in the video series - as either the gruff, semi-villain or as the vaguely simple-minded authority figure in the stories.\n\nIchabeezer is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n\n==Minor characters==\n===Archibald's Wife===\n'''Archibald's Wife''' (introduced 1994) is an [[asparagus]] like her husband and first appeared in ''[[God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!|Larry's Lagoon]]'' as \"'''Lovey'''\" (with Archibald and his wife as a clear allusion to Mr. and Mrs. Howell from [[Gilligan's Island]]). She returned soon after as the Flibbian doctor in ''[[Are You My Neighbor?|The Story of Flibber-O-Loo]]''. She is usually cast alongside Archibald in a supporting role and is differentiated from Mom Asparagus by a longer nose and a British accent similar to Archibald's.\n\nArchibald's Wife is voiced by G. Bock.\n\n===The Peas===\nNot to be confused with the French Peas, '''the Peas''' (introduced 1995) consist of '''Percy Pea''', '''Li'l Pea''', and other [[pea]]s that are only seen in a group of other Veggies as background characters. The Peas first appear as background characters in ''Rack, Shack, and Benny''. They also star as the monks alongside Pa Grape in ''Lyle the Kindly Viking''. In ''Dave and the Giant Pickle'' and ''Josh and the Big Wall'', Percy and other peas appear as the Israelites. The entire family is seen in ''The Toy That Saved Christmas'' where Percy and Li'l Pea receive their first speaking parts. Percy and Li'l Pea see their largest roles in ''Larry-Boy! And the Fib from Outer Space!'', ''Larry-Boy and the Rumor Weed'' and \"Bully Trouble\" (from ''Minnesota Cuke and the Search of Sampson's Hairbrush'').\n\nPhil Vischer voices Percy Pea. Leslie Benodin (1996\u20131999) and Mike Nawrocki voice Li'l Pea (1999\u2013present).\n\n===Grandma Gourd===\n'''Grandma Gourd''' (introduced 2004) is a yellow [[gourd]] who has appeared in several episodes as a minor/background character. Grandma Gourd first appeared in ''Sumo of the Opera'' as a woman beating the Italian Scallion (Larry the Cucumber) over the head with her cane and had several other non-speaking roles in subsequent episodes. Her roles became slightly larger starting in 2010 with a minor speaking part in ''Pistachio - The Little Boy That Woodn't'' as a bookseller, as Mrs. Josephson in ''It's a Meaningful Life'', as Miss Lewis in ''[[Robin Good and The Not-So-Merry Men]]'' and as Old Mother Hubbard ([[Goldilocks]] (Laura Carrot)'s mother) in \"The Good Egg of Gooseville\" portion of the ''Little House That Stood''.\n\nGrandma Gourd is voiced by Keri Pisapia.\n\n===Ma Grape===\n'''Ma Grape''' (introduced 1994) is a [[grape]] with a Southern accent and Pa Grape's wife. Ma Grape made his first appearance in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' along with the rest of her family. She has since appeared in some episodes from the late 2000s to the early 2010s, including as Jetro's Wife in ''Moe and the Big Exit'', and as Sarah in ''Abe and the Amazing Promise''. \n\nMa Grape was voiced by Heidi Landis in her debut episode, and another different actress in some of the later episodes of the original series.\n\n===Tom Grape===\n'''Tom Grape''' (introduced 1994) is a [[grape]] with a Southern accent and Pa Grape's son. Tom made his first appearance in ''God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!'' along with the rest of his family. His only other appearances have been in ''Dave and the Giant Pickle'' and ''Josh and the Big Wall'', both times alongside his father, Pa Grape.\n\nTom Grape is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Charlie Pincher===\n'''Charlie Pincher''' (introduced 2002) is an old [[scallion]] who first appeared in ''The Star of Christmas'' and is frequently cast as a hermit or oddball character, along with having a [[cockney accent]]. He has appeared in such videos as ''The Ballad of Little Joe'', ''Lord of the Beans'', ''Moe and the Big Exit'' and ''Abe and the Amazing Promise''.\n\nCharlie Pincher is voiced by Tim Hodge.\n\n===The Peach===\n'''The Peach''' (introduced 1995) first appears in the Silly Song ''[[Are You My Neighbor?|The Hairbrush Song]]'' and appears to have no actual name as he is only ever referred to by the rest of the cast as \"the peach\". He later appeared in the ''Oh, Santa!'' Silly Song in which he played an [[IRS]] agent. The running joke about the Peach is that he, unlike most of the other characters, has hair. He was thus the obvious choice to play Samson in ''Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush'', however, he is seen only in still pictures throughout the episode. His latest appearance in a speaking role was as a mall employee in ''Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas''.\n\nThe Peach is voiced by Mike Nawrocki.\n\n===Don Gourdon===\n'''Don Gourdon''' (introduced 2005) is one of the [[School bullying|schoolyard bullies]] who is around [[Junior Asparagus|Junior Asparagus']]s age.

His next appearances were as King Twistomer of [[Nineveh]] in ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'', as himself in ''[[Sumo of the Opera]]'', and as Big Jim in ''Huckleberry Larry's Big River Rescue''.\n\nApollo Gourd is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Goliath===\n'''Goliath''' (introduced 1996) is a gigantic [[pickled cucumber|pickle]] who is much larger than any other vegetable in the show. He first appeared as the \"Goliath\" figure alongside the French Peas in ''[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]'' looking for an Israelite to fight. He also appeared in ''[[Madame Blueberry]]'', on a background poster in which he is fighting the Fib in a wrestling match, and in ''[[Josh and the Big Wall]]'' as the dad of a giant pickle family that scared the Israelites out of the Promised Land. He is as a recurring character in \"[[The VeggieTales Show]]\".\n\nGoliath is voiced by Phil Vischer.\n\n===Ellen===\n'''Ellen''' (introduced 2008), debuted in ''[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie]]'', as Mr. Lunt (Buccaneer Sedgewick)'s girlfriend.

Gordon and Gerald E. Kron at [[Lick Observatory]].<ref name=pasp61_362_210/> AD Leonis is one of the most active [[flare star]]s known, and the emissions from the flares have been detected across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] as high as the [[X-ray]] band.<ref name=apj674_2_1078/><ref name=Schmitt/> The net magnetic flux at the surface is about 3&nbsp;kG.<ref name=\"aaa467\" /> Besides star spots, about 73% of the surface is covered by magnetically active regions.<ref name=aaa452_987/> Examination of the [[stellar corona|corona]] in X-ray shows compact loop structures that span up to 30% of the size of the star.<ref name=aaa454_3_889/> The average temperature of the corona is around 6.39&nbsp;[[Megakelvin|MK]].<ref name=aa578_A129/>\n\nDuring a 1943 [[proper motion]] study by [[Dirk Reuyl]] at [[McCormick Observatory]], it was suspected of having a companion. However, a 1968 study by [[Sarah L. Lippincott]] at [[Sproul Observatory]] was unable to confirm this result.<ref name=aj74_224/>\nA 1997 search with a near-infrared speckle interferometer failed to detect a companion orbiting 1\u201310 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] from the star.<ref name=aaa325_159/> In 2001, an optical [[coronagraph]] was used to example the star, but no companion was found.<ref name=aj121_4_2189/> There is no sign of variability in its radial velocity, which would otherwise indicate the presence of an unseen companion.<ref name=Pettersen/>\n\nThis star is orbiting through the [[Milky Way]] galaxy with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.028.

It is located relatively near the [[Sun]], at a distance of about 16 [[light year]]s, in the constellation [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]. AD Leonis is a [[main sequence]] star with a [[spectral classification]] of M3.5V.<ref name=\"apj699\"/> It is a [[flare star]] that undergoes random increases in luminosity.<ref name=\"gcvs71\"/><ref name=\"SIMBAD\" />\n\n==Properties==\nAD Leonis is an [[M-type star]] with a [[spectral type]] M3.5eV, indicating it is a [[main sequence star]] that displays emission lines in its spectrum. At a trigonometric distance of {{convert|15.9|ly|pc|abbr=on}}, it has an apparent visual magnitude of 9.43.<ref name=\"RECONS\" /><ref name=Pettersen/> It has about 39\u201342% of the [[solar mass|Sun's mass]]\u2014above the mass at which a star is [[Convection zone|fully convective]]<ref name=aaa496_3_787/>\u2014and 39% of the [[solar radius|Sun's radius]].<ref name=\"RECONS\"/><ref name=\"apj692\"/> The [[stellar rotation|projected rotation]] of this star is only 3&nbsp;km/s,<ref name=\"aaa467\"/> but it completes a rotation once every 2.24 days.<ref name=aaa496_3_787/> It is a relatively young star with an estimated age of 25\u2013300 million years,<ref name=apj699_1_649/> and is considered a member of the young disk population.<ref name=Sciortino/>\n\nThe variable nature of this star was first observed in 1949 by Katherine C. Gordon and Gerald E. Kron at [[Lick Observatory]].<ref name=pasp61_362_210/> AD Leonis is one of the most active [[flare star]]s known, and the emissions from the flares have been detected across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] as high as the [[X-ray]] band.<ref name=apj674_2_1078/><ref name=Schmitt/> The net magnetic flux at the surface is about 3&nbsp;kG.<ref name=\"aaa467\" /> Besides star spots, about 73% of the surface is covered by magnetically active regions.<ref name=aaa452_987/> Examination of the [[corona]] in X-ray shows compact loop structures that span up to 30% of the size of the star.<ref name=aaa454_3_889/> The average temperature of the corona is around 6.39&nbsp;[[Megakelvin|MK]].<ref name=aa578_A129/>\n\nDuring a 1943 [[proper motion]] study by [[Dirk Reuyl]] at [[McCormick Observatory]], it was suspected of having a companion. However, a 1968 study by [[Sarah L. Lippincott]] at [[Sproul Observatory]] was unable to confirm this result.<ref name=aj74_224/>\nA 1997 search with a near-infrared speckle interferometer failed to detect a companion orbiting 1\u201310 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] from the star.<ref name=aaa325_159/> In 2001, an optical [[coronagraph]] was used to example the star, but no companion was found.<ref name=aj121_4_2189/> There is no sign of variability in its radial velocity, which would otherwise indicate the presence of an unseen companion.<ref name=Pettersen/>\n\nThis star is orbiting through the [[Milky Way]] galaxy with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.028. This carries the star as close as 8.442 kpc from the galactic core, and as far as 8.926 kpc. The orbital [[inclination]] carries it as far as 0.121 kpc from the plane of the galaxy.<ref name=rmaa34_37/>\n\n==Planetary System==\n\nIn 2019 one candidate planet been detected by the [[radial velocity method]]<ref>{{cite arxiv|last=Barnes|first=J.
