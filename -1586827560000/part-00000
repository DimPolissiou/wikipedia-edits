The leading actress, [[Nargis]], won the distinguished [[National Film Award for Best Actress]] for her role as Varuna, a married woman who has [[dissociative identity disorder]]. By day, she is a typical Hindu homemaker, whilst at night she calls herself Peggy and walks the streets of [[Calcutta]]. The film won critical acclaim for its story and Nargis' performance as Varuna. Over the years it has developed a cult following. This film marked Nargis' final film appearance.\n\n== Plot ==\nOnce, during a late night a woman named Varuna goes to a club and dances with an unknown club man named Dilip. He mentions meeting Varuna in [[Shimla]] before, but she denies ever being in S. Meanwhile, her husband Pratap follows her. Upon confronting her, she says her name is Peggy and denies ever being married to him, and soon leaves. The next morning, back at the house Pratap again confronts Varuna about the previous night, but she denies ever leaving the house; meanwhile, Dilip arrives and confesses to being in the club with Varuna.\n\nAt a clinic, the doctors say that it might be MPD, but are unsure until they know about her past. Pratap tells that once he was going to [[Shimla]], when his car broke down and was forced to stay at Varuna's house, during which both fell in love. But once the car was fixed, Pratap left as he was going to Simla for marriage approval, but doesn't accept and returns to Varuna and get married, much to the disapproval of Pratap's mother. After this, Varuna frequently gets headaches and at night would dance to loud music. Once at a picnic, a boulder slides down a cliff, which triggers some childhood memories of Varuna and she screams. Her mother-in-law arranges a witch doctor, believing Varuna is under Voodoo, but is unsuccessful. Things become a bit better on holidays, but at a party at home, Varuna drinks alcohol. The next day, Pratap leaves town for an emergency but after coming back, finds someone is heavily drinking alcohol, but couldn't reach a conclusion. Then comes the night when Varuna goes out in the club and dances with Dilip.\n\nIn present, a few days later the doctors tell Varuna is sick and is admitted to a mental institute to have her treatment, but her MPD keeps getting out of control and she would leave the institute. The doctors would follow and she displays both Varuna and Peggy simultaneously, but then completely loses her mind. Later, she gets shock treatment, but it's unsuccessful. She would then walk on the streets at night and would sing. She comes to a random house in the rain and gets unconscious. The woman in the house says that Varuna is pregnant, but it is Peggy on the mind and denies being married and asks for an abortion, but the woman doesn't know how. After some time, when Varuna wakes up, she is Varuna and the woman again tells her about being pregnant. At this time, Varuna realizes that whatever she was denying was all true and knows she has MPD. She returns home, but her mother-in-law doesn't allow, claiming she is unfaithful. Varuna then meets a minor road accident and is hospitalized. Pratap and Varuna's father come, but she is in shock and couldn't figure out anything. Something triggers her mind when a nurse drops a tray. The doctors ask Varuna's father to tell about Varuna's past. In the past, Varuna's father was a heavy gambler and would abuse his wife. His wife leaves for Shimla with Varuna.\n\nAt Shimla it all comes to Varuna and she reveals what happened in Simla. After leaving, Varuna's mother would keep Varuna isolated, but Varuna secretly befriends a neighbor girl named Peggy. Peggy is a very sweet girl who dances with loud music, which makes Varuna want to dance also. Her mother would get harsh if she found Varuna talking to Peggy. Once grown, Varuna leaves the house and goes a Christmas party secretly. There is also Dilip sitting and watching. Once she leaves the party, Varuna's mother finds out and says she is not her daughter anymore and is angry, but slides down a cliff and dies. Varuna blames herself for her mother death. The doctor informs that this trauma caused Varuna to hate herself and make a new personality named Peggy because she yearned for her lifestyle, which caused her MPD in the first place. In the end, the doctors reveal her mother died of heart failure, by which she lost balance and died falling off the cliff, and Varuna is cured after hearing and regaining self-confidence in her Varuna personality.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Pradeep Kumar]] ...

According to Klyashtorny, *''n\u00f6n\u00f6r'' denotes \"stepnaja vol'nica\" \"a free, roving band in the steppe, the '[[Comes|companions]]' of the early Rouran leaders.\" However, Golden identifies philological problems: the ethnonym should have been *''n\u00f6\u014b\u00f6r'' to be cognate to ''n\u00f6k\u00fcr'', & possible assimilation of velar -/k/- into coronal nasal -/n/- in Chinese transcription needs further linguistic proofs.\n\nEven if \u67d4\u7136 somehow transmitted ''n\u00f6k\u00fcr'', it more likely denoted the Rouran's status as the subjects of the [[Tuoba]]. Before being used as an ethnonym, Rouran had originally been the byname of chief Cheluhui (\u8f66\u9e7f\u4f1a), possibly denoting his status \"as a [[Northern Wei|Wei]] servitor\".<ref>[[Peter Benjamin Golden|Golden, Peter B.]] \"Some Notes on the Avars and Rouran\", in ''The Steppe Lands and the World beyond Them''.

In fact the name ''Rouran'' itself as used by the Xianbei means something akin to \"wriggling worms\". After the Xianbei migrated south and settled in Chinese lands during the late 3rd century AD, the Rouran made a name for themselves as fierce warriors. However they remained politically fragmented until 402 AD when Shelun gained support of all the Rouran chieftains and united the Rouran under one banner. Immediately after uniting, the Rouran entered a perpetual conflict with [[Northern Wei]], beginning with a Wei offensive that drove the Rouran from the [[Ordos region]]. The Rouran expanded westward and defeated the neighboring [[Tiele people]] and expanded their territory over the [[Silk Roads]], even vassalizing the [[Hephthalites]] which remained so until the beginning of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Grousset 1970, p. 67\">Grousset (1970), p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"Kurbanov\">Kurbanov, A.

According to Klyashtorny, *''n\u00f6n\u00f6r'' denotes \"stepnaja vol'nica\" \"a free, roving band in the steppe, the '[[Comes|companions]]' of the early Rouran leaders.\" However, Golden identifies philological problems: the ethnonym should have been *''n\u00f6\u014b\u00f6r'' to be cognate to ''n\u00f6k\u00fcr'', & possible assimilation of velar -/k/- into coronal nasal -/n/- in Chinese transcription needs further linguistic proofs.\n\nEven if \u67d4\u7136 somehow transmitted ''n\u00f6k\u00fcr'', it more likely denoted the Rouran's status as the subjects of the [[Tuoba]]. Before being used as an ethnonym, Rouran had originally been the byname of chief Cheluhui (\u8f66\u9e7f\u4f1a), possibly denoting his status \"as a [[Northern Wei|Wei]] servitor\".<ref>[[Peter Benjamin Golden|Golden, Peter B.]] \"Some Notes on the Avars and Rouran\", in ''The Steppe Lands and the World beyond Them''.

In fact the name ''Rouran'' itself as used by the Xianbei means something akin to \"wriggling worms\". After the Xianbei migrated south and settled in Chinese lands during the late 3rd century AD, the Rouran made a name for themselves as fierce warriors. However they remained politically fragmented until 402 AD when Shelun gained support of all the Rouran chieftains and united the Rouran under one banner. Immediately after uniting, the Rouran entered a perpetual conflict with [[Northern Wei]], beginning with a Wei offensive that drove the Rouran from the [[Ordos region]]. The Rouran expanded westward and defeated the neighboring [[Tiele people]] and expanded their territory over the [[Silk Roads]], even vassalizing the [[Hephthalites]] which remained so until the beginning of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Grousset 1970, p. 67\">Grousset (1970), p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"Kurbanov\">Kurbanov, A.

Despite the conflict between the Hephthalites and Rouran, the Hephthalites borrowed much from their eastern overlords, in particular the title of \"[[Khan (title)|Khan]]\" which was first used by the Rouran as a title for their rulers.<ref name=\"Kurbanov\" />\n\nIn 424, the Rouran invaded Northern Wei but were repulsed.{{sfn|Grousset|1970|p=61}}\n\nIn 429, Northern Wei launched a major offensive against the Rouran and killed a large number of people.<ref name=\"Grousset 1970, p. 67\">Grousset (1970), p. 67.</ref>\n\n{{quotation|The Chinese are foot soldiers and we are horsemen.

The majority of them were found to be primarily of East Asian origin.

[[Music journalism|Music critic]]s were divided by the band's choices in production and lyricism, despite being better than their [[Kasabian (album)|self-titled debut]]. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 65, based on 20 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nDan Martin of ''[[NME]]'' found the album better than their self-titled debut, praising the band for mixing all their influences into tracks that can be called their own, saying that \"Through sheer, bloody-minded relief, weapons-graded stamina and a big, big imagination, Kasabian have willed themselves into brilliance.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Jason MacNeil of ''[[PopMatters]]'' found some production choices on the tracks off-putting but said that the album shows the band's potential of crafting better projects in their given ilk, concluding that \"On the whole, it\u2019s a good second step, but hopefully step three is more in line with the shock and awe the first album contained.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/> Chris Salmon of ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that Kasabian's boastful talk of the album resulted in a mixed bag of tracks that fall just shy of their claim, in terms of influenced production and lyricism, saying that \"While ''Empire'' isn't an exceptional record, it offers enough to be described as a good one.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\n[[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries commended the band for taking a grand-scale approach to mixing their influences into an [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]-sized project, but felt they forgot to write catchy tracks to lead the album, saying that, \"Lost in all this is the instantly grabbing songwriting of Kasabian's debut, and to some extent, the bandmembers themselves, who often seem to be riding this swirl instead of guiding it.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Despite praising a few tracks, Lauren Murphy of [[Entertainment.ie]] felt the album was just a retread of their debut with Tom Meighan's vocals starting to sound strained throughout, concluding with, \"If Kasabian hadn't attempted to build their Empire by recounting its wonderment prematurely, it might have stood a chance; instead, their audacity just proves them to be, unsurprisingly, more geezer, less Caesar.\"<ref name=\"IE\"/> Peter Relic of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized the album for sounding like a rehash of established British rock bands and Meighan for having weak vocal delivery on the tracks, calling it \"miles worse than their shallow but tasty first, its big-budget production only making its shortcomings more apparent.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing     = Sergio Pizzorno, except where noted\n| title1          = [[Empire (Kasabian song)|Empire]]\n| length1         = 3:53\n| note1           = Pizzorno, Christopher Karloff\n| title2          = [[Shoot the Runner]]\n| length2         = 3:27\n| title3          = Last Trip (In Flight)\n| length3         = 2:53\n| title4          = [[Me Plus One]]\n| length4         = 2:28\n| title5          = Sun Rise Light Flies\n| length5         = 4:08\n| title6          = Apnoea\n| length6         = 1:48\n| title7          = By My Side\n| length7         = 4:14\n| note7           = Pizzorno, Karloff\n| title8          = Stuntman\n| length8         = 5:19\n| note8           = Pizzorno, Karloff\n| title9          = Seek & Destroy\n| length9         = 2:15\n| title10         = British Legion\n| length10        = 3:19\n| title11         = The Doberman\n| length11        = 5:34\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = US [[iTunes Store]] bonus tracks<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/empire-bonus-track-version/id279207249|title=iTunes - Music - Empire (Bonus Track Version) by Kasabian|work=iTunes}}</ref>\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12         = Ketang\n| length12        = 2:11\n| note12          = Bonus Track\n| title13         = [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|Heroes (David Bowie cover)]]\n| length13        = 2:30\n| note13          = [[David Bowie]], [[Brian Eno]]) (Bonus Track\n| title14         = Empire\n| length14        = 4:52\n| note14          = Video\n| title15         = Empire \n| length15        = 9:43\n| note15          = Commentary) (Bonus Video\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = European [[iTunes Store]] bonus tracks<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/de/album/empire/id207132115|title=iTunes - Music - Empire by Kasabian|work=iTunes}}</ref>\n| collapsed = yes\n\n| title12         = Shoot the Runner\n| length12        = 5:21\n| note12          = Live from XFM\n| title13         = Reason Is Treason\n| length13        = 4:52\n| note13          = Live from XFM\n| title14         = Empire\n| length14        = 4:00\n| note14          = Live from XFM\n| title15         = The Doberman\n| length15        = 5:52\n| note15          = Live from XFM\n| title16         = L.S.F.

The implements and initial 'Q' on the reverse allude to his term as [[quaestor]].<ref>Broughton, vol. II, p. 387</ref>]]\nThe '''gens Sosia''', occasionally written '''Sossia''', was a [[plebs|plebeian]] family at [[ancient Rome]].  Members of this [[gens]] occur in history from the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] down to the third century AD.  The first of the Sosii to attain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Gaius Sosius]] in 32 BC, and the family would continue holding various positions in the Roman state until the third century.\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe only [[praenomen|praenomina]] associated with the Sosii of the Republic were ''[[Titus (praenomen)|Titus]]'' and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]''.  The Sosii Falcones of [[Roman Empire|imperial times]] used ''[[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]]'' and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  All of these were extremely common throughout Roman history.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Sosii of the Republic bore no [[cognomen|cognomina]], and were not divided into distinct families.  In the second century, however, a family bearing the name of ''Sosius Falco'' appears, descended from a daughter of [[Quintus Sosius Senecio]], consul in AD 99 and 107, who married [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]], consul in 109.  ''Senecio'', the original surname, was derived from ''senex'', an old man, while ''Falco'', a falcon, was inherited from the [[Pompeia (gens)|Pompeii]]; it frequently denoted someone whose feet resembled talons; the modern expression is \"pigeon-toed\".<ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. senex, falco''.</ref>  ''Priscus'', borne by some of the same family, was a common surname meaning \"old\" or \"elder\".<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Roma-tempio di apollo.jpg|thumb|Columns from the [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus]], rebuilt by [[Gaius Sosius]] about 34 BC.]]\n{{filiation}}\n\n* Quintus Sosius, eminent [[equites|equestrian]] from [[Picenum]], who confessed to the crime of burning the [[Tabularium]] in 83 BC.<ref>Cicero ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 3.74</ref>\n* Titus Sosius, grandfather of the consul Gaius Sosius, and probably father of the quaestor of 66 BC.<ref>Broughton, vol.

The implements and initial 'Q' on the reverse allude to his term as [[quaestor]].<ref>Broughton, vol. II, p. 387</ref>]]\nThe '''gens Sosia''', occasionally written '''Sossia''', was a [[plebs|plebeian]] family at [[ancient Rome]].  Members of this [[gens]] occur in history from the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] down to the third century AD.  The first of the Sosii to attain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Gaius Sosius]] in 32 BC, and the family would continue holding various positions in the Roman state until the third century.\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe only [[praenomen|praenomina]] associated with the Sosii of the Republic were ''[[Titus (praenomen)|Titus]]'' and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]''.  The Sosii Falcones of [[Roman Empire|imperial times]] used ''[[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]]'' and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  All of these were extremely common throughout Roman history.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Sosii of the Republic bore no [[cognomen|cognomina]], and were not divided into distinct families.  In the second century, however, a family bearing the name of ''Sosius Falco'' appears, descended from a daughter of [[Quintus Sosius Senecio]], consul in AD 99 and 107, who married [[Quintus Pompeius Falco]], consul in 109.  ''Senecio'', the original surname, was derived from ''senex'', an old man, while ''Falco'', a falcon, was inherited from the [[Pompeia (gens)|Pompeii]]; it frequently denoted someone whose feet resembled talons; the modern expression is \"pigeon-toed\".<ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s. v. senex, falco''.</ref>  ''Priscus'', borne by some of the same family, was a common surname meaning \"old\" or \"elder\".<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Roma-tempio di apollo.jpg|thumb|Columns from the [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus]], rebuilt by [[Gaius Sosius]] about 34 BC.]]\n{{filiation}}\n\n* Quintus Sosius, eminent [[equites|equestrian]] from [[Picenum]], who confessed to the crime of burning the [[Tabularium]] in 83 BC.<ref>Cicero ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 3.74</ref>\n* Titus Sosius, grandfather of the consul Gaius Sosius, and probably father of the quaestor of 66 BC.<ref>Broughton, vol.
