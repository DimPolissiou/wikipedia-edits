While working on anti-aircraft artillery during [[World War II]], Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing.<ref name=BynumVeryShort/> Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems, \"[[cybernetics]],\" and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, ''Cybernetics''.<ref name=BynumVeryShort/><ref name=BynumSEP>{{cite web |last1=Bynum |first1=Terrell |title=Computer Ethics: Basic Concepts and Historical Overview |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/ethics-computer/ |date=21 December 2014 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}</ref> In 1950, Wiener's second book, ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]'', delved deeper into the ethical issues surrounding information technology and laid out the basic foundations of computer ethics.<ref name=BynumSEP/>\n\nA bit later during the same year, the world's first [[computer crime]] was committed. A programmer was able to use a bit of computer code to stop his banking account from being flagged as overdrawn. However, there were no laws in place at that time to stop him, and as a result he was not charged.<ref name=BriefHistory>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Computer Ethics |url=http://www.comphist.org/computing_history/new_page_5.htm |website=Learning Computing History |date=5 December 2004 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors.

Parker|Donn Parker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2002#Parker|title=Alumni Hall of Fame: Donn Parker|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> an author on computer crimes, led the committee that developed the code.<ref name=BynumVeryShort/>\n\nIn 1976, medical teacher and researcher Walter Maner noticed that ethical decisions are much harder to make when computers are added. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The term \"computer ethics\" was thus invented.<ref name=BynumVeryShort/><ref name=BynumSEP/>\n\nIn 1976 [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] made his second significant addition to the field of computer ethics. He published a book titled ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason]]'',<ref name=ObituaryWeizenbaum>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Joseph Weizenbaum |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N12/weizenbaum.html |newspaper=The Tech |edition=Online |volume=128 |issue=12 |date=14 March 2008 |publisher=MIT News office |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}</ref> which talked about how [[artificial intelligence]] is good for the world; however it should never be allowed to make the most important decisions as it does not have human qualities such as wisdom. By far the most important point he makes in the book is the distinction between choosing and deciding. He argued that deciding is a computational activity while making choices is not and thus the ability to make choices is what makes us humans.\n\nAt a later time during the same year [[Abbe Mowshowitz]], a professor of Computer Science at the City College of New York, published an article titled \"On approaches to the study of social issues in computing.\" This article identified and analyzed technical and non-technical biases in research on social issues present in computing.\n\nDuring 1978, the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] was adopted by the United States Congress, drastically limiting the government's ability to search bank records.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Right to Financial Privacy Act |website=Electronic Privacy Information Center |url=https://epic.org/privacy/rfpa/ |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the next year [[Terrell Ward Bynum]], the professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University as well as Director of the Research Center on Computing and Society there, developed curriculum for a university course on computer ethics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ear/cs349/Bynum_Short_History.html|title=A Very Short History of Computer Ethics ( Text Only) - The Research Center on Computing & Society|website=www.cs.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Bynum was also editor of the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]].''<ref name=BynumVeryShort/> In 1983 the journal held an essay contest on the topic of computer ethics and published the winning essays in its best-selling 1985 special issue, \u201cComputers and Ethics.\u201d<ref name=BynumVeryShort/>\n\nIn 1984, the United States Congress passed the Small Business Computer Security and Education Act, which created a [[Small Business Administration]] advisory council to focus on computer security related to small businesses.<ref>{{USBill|98|HR|3075|pipe=Small Business Computer Security and Education Act of 1984|site=yes}}</ref>\n \nIn 1985, [[James Moor]], Professor of Philosophy at DartMouth College in New Hampshire, published an essay called \"What is Computer Ethics?\"<ref name=BynumSEP/> In this essay Moor states the computer ethics includes the following: \"(1) identification of computer-generated policy vacuums, (2) clarification of conceptual muddles, (3) formulation of policies for the use of computer technology, and (4) ethical justification of such policies.\"<ref name=BynumVeryShort/>\n\nDuring the same year, Deborah Johnson, Professor of Applied Ethics and Chair of the Department of Science, Technology, and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of the University of Virginia, got the first major computer ethics textbook published.<ref name=BynumSEP/> Johnson's textbook identified major issues for research in computer ethics for more than 10 years after publication of the first edition.<ref name=BynumSEP/>\n\nIn 1988, Robert Hauptman, a librarian at St. Cloud University, came up with \"[[information ethics]]\", a term that was used to describe the storage, production, access and dissemination of information.<ref name=BriefHistory/>{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors.

Internet users hand over [[personal information]] in order to sign up or register for services without realizing that they are potentially setting themselves up for invasions of privacy.<ref>CSC300 Lecture Notes @ University of Toronto, 2011.

There is a feature within searching that allows Google to keep track of searches so that advertisements will match your search criteria, which in turn means using people as products. Google was sued in 2018 due to tracking user location without permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-sued-over-keeping-location-data-amid-privacy-concerns/ |title= Google sued over tracking user location amid privacy concerns}}</ref>\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion about what privacy and privacy enforcement measures imply. With the increase in [[social networking]] sites, more and more people are allowing their private information to be shared publicly. On the surface, this may be seen as someone listing private information about them on a social networking site, but below the surface, it is the site that could be sharing the information (not the individual). This is the idea of an [[opt-in]] versus [[opt-out]] situation. There are many privacy statements that state whether there is an opt-in or an opt-out policy. Typically an opt-in [[privacy policy]] means that the individual has to tell the company issuing the privacy policy if they want their information shared or not. Opt-out means that their information will be shared unless the individual tells the company not to share it.\n\nA whole industry of privacy and ethical tools has grown over time, giving people the choice to not share their data online. These are often open source software, which allows the users to ensure that their data is not saved to be used without their consent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ethical.net/resources/ |title=Ethical Alternatives and Resources}}</ref>\n\n==Identifying issues==\nIdentifying ''ethical'' issues as they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem.  The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Ethical standards==\nVarious national and international professional societies and organizations have produced code of ethics documents to give basic behavioral guidelines to computing professionals and users.

A programmer was able to use a bit of computer code to stop his banking account from being flagged as overdrawn. However, there were no laws in place at that time to stop him, and as a result he was not charged.<ref name=BriefHistory>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Computer Ethics |url=http://www.comphist.org/computing_history/new_page_5.htm |website=Learning Computing History |date=5 December 2004 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors.

Parker|Donn Parker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2002#Parker|title=Alumni Hall of Fame: Donn Parker|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> an author on computer crimes, led the committee that developed the code.<ref name=BynumVeryShort/>\n\nIn 1976, medical teacher and researcher Walter Maner noticed that ethical decisions are much harder to make when computers are added. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The term \"computer ethics\" was thus invented.<ref name=BynumVeryShort/><ref name=BynumSEP/>\n\nIn 1976 [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] made his second significant addition to the field of computer ethics. He published a book titled ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason]]'',<ref name=ObituaryWeizenbaum>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Joseph Weizenbaum |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N12/weizenbaum.html |newspaper=The Tech |edition=Online |volume=128 |issue=12 |date=14 March 2008 |publisher=MIT News office |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}</ref> which talked about how [[artificial intelligence]] is good for the world; however it should never be allowed to make the most important decisions as it does not have human qualities such as wisdom. By far the most important point he makes in the book is the distinction between choosing and deciding. He argued that deciding is a computational activity while making choices is not and thus the ability to make choices is what makes us humans.\n\nAt a later time during the same year [[Abbe Mowshowitz]], a professor of Computer Science at the City College of New York, published an article titled \"On approaches to the study of social issues in computing.\" This article identified and analyzed technical and non-technical biases in research on social issues present in computing.\n\nDuring 1978, the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] was adopted by the United States Congress, drastically limiting the government's ability to search bank records.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Right to Financial Privacy Act |website=Electronic Privacy Information Center |url=https://epic.org/privacy/rfpa/ |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the next year [[Terrell Ward Bynum]], the professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University as well as Director of the Research Center on Computing and Society there, developed curriculum for a university course on computer ethics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ear/cs349/Bynum_Short_History.html|title=A Very Short History of Computer Ethics ( Text Only) - The Research Center on Computing & Society|website=www.cs.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Bynum was also editor of the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]].''<ref name=BynumVeryShort/> In 1983 the journal held an essay contest on the topic of computer ethics and published the winning essays in its best-selling 1985 special issue, \u201cComputers and Ethics.\u201d<ref name=BynumVeryShort/>\n\nIn 1984, the United States Congress passed the Small Business Computer Security and Education Act, which created a [[Small Business Administration]] advisory council to focus on computer security related to small businesses.<ref>{{USBill|98|HR|3075|pipe=Small Business Computer Security and Education Act of 1984|site=yes}}</ref>\n \nIn 1985, [[James Moor]], Professor of Philosophy at DartMouth College in New Hampshire, published an essay called \"What is Computer Ethics?\"<ref name=BynumSEP/> In this essay Moor states the computer ethics includes the following: \"(1) identification of computer-generated policy vacuums, (2) clarification of conceptual muddles, (3) formulation of policies for the use of computer technology, and (4) ethical justification of such policies.\"<ref name=BynumVeryShort/>\n\nDuring the same year, Deborah Johnson, Professor of Applied Ethics and Chair of the Department of Science, Technology, and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of the University of Virginia, got the first major computer ethics textbook published.<ref name=BynumSEP/> Johnson's textbook identified major issues for research in computer ethics for more than 10 years after publication of the first edition.<ref name=BynumSEP/>\n\nIn 1988, Robert Hauptman, a librarian at St. Cloud University, came up with \"[[information ethics]]\", a term that was used to describe the storage, production, access and dissemination of information.<ref name=BriefHistory/>{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors.

Internet users hand over [[personal information]] in order to sign up or register for services without realizing that they are potentially setting themselves up for invasions of privacy.<ref>CSC300 Lecture Notes @ University of Toronto, 2011. For more information on this topic, please visit the [http://epic.org Electronic Privacy Information Center] website.</ref>{{Better source|date=April 2015}}\n\nAnother example of [[privacy issues]], with concern to [[Google]], is [[Website visitor tracking|tracking]] [[web search|searches]]. There is a feature within searching that allows Google to keep track of searches so that advertisements will match your search criteria, which in turn means using people as products. Google was sued in 2018 due to tracking user location without permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-sued-over-keeping-location-data-amid-privacy-concerns/ |title= Google sued over tracking user location amid privacy concerns}}</ref>\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion about what privacy and privacy enforcement measures imply. With the increase in [[social networking]] sites, more and more people are allowing their private information to be shared publicly. On the surface, this may be seen as someone listing private information about them on a social networking site, but below the surface, it is the site that could be sharing the information (not the individual). This is the idea of an [[opt-in]] versus [[opt-out]] situation. There are many privacy statements that state whether there is an opt-in or an opt-out policy. Typically an opt-in [[privacy policy]] means that the individual has to tell the company issuing the privacy policy if they want their information shared or not. Opt-out means that their information will be shared unless the individual tells the company not to share it.\n\nA whole industry of privacy and ethical tools has grown over time, giving people the choice to not share their data online. These are often open source software, which allows the users to ensure that their data is not saved to be used without their consent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ethical.net/resources/ |title=Ethical Alternatives and Resources}}</ref>\n\n==Identifying issues==\nIdentifying ''ethical'' issues as they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem.  The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Ethical standards==\nVarious national and international professional societies and organizations have produced code of ethics documents to give basic behavioral guidelines to computing professionals and users.

The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive [[void coefficient]] and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became [[prompt critical]]. This was followed by a [[steam explosion]] that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a [[core meltdown]]. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the [[graphite]] moderator that made up most of the core was involved.  See [[Chernobyl Disaster]], Note 1, for more discussion. || The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large [[tsunami]]. Subsequent review did not lead to mitigation. A major [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]] caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic [[decay heat]] casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]s and explosive loss of [[reactor containment]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n|-\n| '''Maximum level of [[radiation]] detected''' || 300 [[sievert|Sv]]/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core.<ref name=\"medv\">{{cite web|url = http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA335076|archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110324215518/http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA335076|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2011-03-24|title = JPRS Report: Soviet Union Economic Affairs Chernobyl Notebook|author = B.

The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive [[void coefficient]] and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became [[prompt critical]]. This was followed by a [[steam explosion]] that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a [[core meltdown]]. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the [[graphite]] moderator that made up most of the core was involved.  See [[Chernobyl Disaster]], Note 1, for more discussion. || The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large [[tsunami]]. Subsequent review did not lead to mitigation. A major [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]] caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic [[decay heat]] casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]s and explosive loss of [[reactor containment]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n|-\n| '''Maximum level of [[radiation]] detected''' || 300 [[sievert|Sv]]/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core.<ref name=\"medv\">{{cite web|url = http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA335076|archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110324215518/http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA335076|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2011-03-24|title = JPRS Report: Soviet Union Economic Affairs Chernobyl Notebook|author = B.

It stars Lee, [[Maria Yi]], [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] and [[Tony Liu]]. Originally written for Tien, the leading role was given to Lee instead when the film's original director, Ng Kar-seung, was replaced by Lo. The film was a critical success and excelled at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|title=In Review: The Big Boss on DVD|author=Michael Ewins|date=4 July 2012|work=New Empress Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208142724/http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee's strong performance overshadowed Tien, already a star in Hong Kong, and made Bruce Lee famous across Asia, and eventually, the world.\n\n==Plot==\nCheng Chao-an (Pronounced \"Cheng Chow-On\") ([[Bruce Lee]]) is a Chinese man who moves to [[Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]], to live with his adopted family and to work in an ice factory. He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs which steal dumplings from Hsu's Brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the iceblocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=Bruce Lee the Legend |format=Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= | year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong,<ref name=mandarin /> a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were plentiful in the hotel, and the tap water was yellow.<ref name=Letters>Little, John (1998). ''Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon''.</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the overbearing and aggressive original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a fame lover and not particularly focused on being much of a director. Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby Rimtarninn Hotel (formerly New Wan Chai), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>In Pursuit of the Dragon (documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> In both cases the director stuck to his guns.\n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climatic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters /><ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in Bangkok was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=JKDClub /><ref name=mandarin /> before flying to the US the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, [[Fist of Fury]].<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside drinks vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release and box office==\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=Nation>New Nation, 29 November 1971, page 1</ref> It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over S$700,000 ({{US$|{{To USD|700000|SGP|year=2011|round=yes}}|link=no}}), about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name=Straits>The Straits Times, 24 January 1972, page 5</ref> The film also played to packed cinemas in [[Malaysia]], the third territory to show the film.\n\nDespite the enormous success of ''The Big Boss'' in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they didn't think it had potential outside Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe.<ref name=Misad>Death by Misadventure (director Toby Russell)</ref> In the UK however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).<ref name=Straits2>The Straits Times, 28 April 1972, page 17</ref> There was also a delay in the US, as distributors [[National General Pictures]] disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue.<ref name=Misad /> This new version was eventually released in the US in April 1973 with the title ''Fists of Fury'', about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (retitled ''The Chinese Connection'' in the U.S.), Lee's second major role, had been released in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film reviews: Fists of Fury|date=27 June 1973|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=34}}</ref> It was an instant hit, surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the villains from the gambling den. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the Original Cantonese language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Mandarin release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Mandarin version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss? (Or How I Learned to Stop Complaining and Love The Big Boss Part II)]</ref><ref>Logan, Bey ''Bruce Lee and I'' (Reel East Press, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Other actors as Bruce Lee playing Cheng Chao-an==\nVarious Bruce Lee biopics have been filmed over the years, with the two most famous being ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth]]'' and ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;

He meets his cousins Hsu Chien ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs. Cheng refrains from getting involved, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powder falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby keeping the secret safe.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another cousin, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are killed.\n\nWhen the workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien in the iceblocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by knocking the knife backwards after Mi throws it at him. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe, he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense. The movie ends as the crowd walks back to the police car to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=Bruce Lee the Legend |format=Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= | year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong,<ref name=mandarin /> a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were plentiful in the hotel, and the tap water was yellow.<ref name=Letters>Little, John (1998). ''Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon''.</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the overbearing and aggressive original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a fame lover and not particularly focused on being much of a director. Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong.

The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby Rimtarninn Hotel (formerly New Wan Chai), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>In Pursuit of the Dragon (documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> In both cases the director stuck to his guns.\n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climatic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters /><ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in Bangkok was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=JKDClub /><ref name=mandarin /> before flying to the US the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, [[Fist of Fury]].<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside drinks vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release and box office==\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=Nation>New Nation, 29 November 1971, page 1</ref> It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over S$700,000 ({{US$|{{To USD|700000|SGP|year=2011|round=yes}}|link=no}}), about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name=Straits>The Straits Times, 24 January 1972, page 5</ref> The film also played to packed cinemas in [[Malaysia]], the third territory to show the film.\n\nDespite the enormous success of ''The Big Boss'' in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they didn't think it had potential outside Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe.<ref name=Misad>Death by Misadventure (director Toby Russell)</ref> In the UK however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).<ref name=Straits2>The Straits Times, 28 April 1972, page 17</ref> There was also a delay in the US, as distributors [[National General Pictures]] disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue.<ref name=Misad /> This new version was eventually released in the US in April 1973 with the title ''Fists of Fury'', about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (retitled ''The Chinese Connection'' in the U.S.), Lee's second major role, had been released in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film reviews: Fists of Fury|date=27 June 1973|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=34}}</ref> It was an instant hit, surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsiu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the villains from the gambling den. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsiu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsiu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the Original Cantonese language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Mandarin release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Mandarin version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss?

Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]].

Its annual crude steel capacity and rolled product capacity are 5.6 million and 5.1 million tons, respectively.  It produces a broad line of steel products, including slabs, hot- and cold-rolled, [[galvanized]] and [[tin]] mill products.  Its products are used by the distribution, packaging, [[automotive]], home appliance and construction industries.\n\nCSN accounted for approximately 49% of the galvanized steel products sold in Brazil.  In 2004, it accounted for approximately 98% of the tin mill products sold in Brazil.  It is one of the world's leading producers of tin mill products.  CSN also owns its own source of [[iron]] ore.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Sede da CSN.jpg|250px|thumb|right|CSN Central Office in [[Volta Redonda]]. {{deletable image-caption}}]] -->\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and expansion (1941-1980)===\n[[File:Constru\u00e7\u00e3o da Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN).tif|thumb|250px|right|Construction of Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN) in 1941.]]\n[[File:Inaugura\u00e7\u00e3o pelo Presidente Eurico Gaspar Dutra da Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN).tif|thumb|250px|right|Inauguration by President Eurico Gaspar Dutra of Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN) in 1946.]]\nCompanhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional was created as a state-owned company on April 9, 1941, during the \"[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|''Estado Novo'' era]]\", during the term of Brazilian president, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], after an agreement between the [[United States|American]] and the Brazilian governments (see the [[Washington Accords (1942)|Washington Accords]]) for the construction of a facility that would provide steel for the Allies during the Second World War and later be an aid for Brazil's development.  It began its operations in 1946, under [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]'s presidency.\n\nCSN was a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941 pursuant to a decree of Brazilian President Get\u00falio Vargas.  The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located at Volta Redonda, in Rio de Janeiro State, started production in 1946.  It initially produced coke, pig iron castings and long products.  Two major expansions were undertaken at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks during the 1970s.  The first, completed in 1974, increased installed annual production capacity to 1.6 million tons of crude steel.  The second, completed in 1977, raised capacity to 2.4 million tons of crude steel.\n\n===1980 - 2005 ===\nCSN underwent another expansion  in 1989, increasing capacity to 4.5 million tons of crude steel.  The company was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% interest in the company.\n\nIn 1993, CSN adopted a capital improvement program, which was revised and extended in 1995.  The goals were: an increase in annual production of crude steel; improvement in productivity, increase in the quality of the products, and enhancement of the environmental protection and cleanup programs.  Since February 1996, all production has been based on the [[continuous casting]] process, rather than ingot casting, an alternative method that results in higher energy use and metal loss.  From 1996 through 2002, CSN spent the equivalent of US$2.4 billion under the capital improvement program and for operational capacity maintenance, culminating with the revamping in 2001 of Blast Furnace #3 and Hot Strip Mill #2 at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks increasing  annual production capacity to 5.6 million tons of crude steel and 5.1 million tons of rolled products, from approximately 5.0 million tons in each case.\n\nIn 2005 reinforced its position as the largest iron-mining operation in the country, through a controlling stake in [[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]] (CVRD).{{fact|date=April 2016}}{{disputed-inline|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn January 2004, the CSN board announced the approval of investments up to US$820 million to be made through 2007, including: expansion of production at the Casa de Pedra iron ore mine from 15.5 to approximately 40 million tons; expansion of the [[coal]] terminal adjacent to the [[Sepetiba]] Port facilities to enable annual exports of up to 30 million tons of iron ore; and the construction of a six million-ton pellet plant. The company also explored opportunities for acquisitions or mergers abroad in order to expand output, and proposed to build a new steel plant which would have doubled current annual production of 5.8 million tons of raw steel, at an estimated investment cost of US$2.6 billion.  Seeking to maintain focus on its program of acquisitions and growth, CSN set aside $520 million for investments in 2005.\n\n===Privatization ( 1993-present )===\nIn 1993 the company was privatized by [[Itamar Franco]]'s government, during the National Program for Privatization led by the federal government, started by [[Fernando Collor]] and continued by Franco.<ref>Arquivo Nacional (Brasil), ''Os Presidentes e a Rep\u00fablica: Deodoro da Fonseca a Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva'', 2\u00aa ed., Rio de Janeiro, 2003, pg. 189.</ref>\n\nIts main factories were located in Volta Redonda, at the Vale do Para\u00edba region, southern [[Rio de Janeiro]] state, and its iron mines at Congonhas and Arcos, both of them cities in the Minas Gerais state, and the coal mines at Sider\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina state.\n\nDuring almost 50 years of state control, the Brazilian flat steel sector was coordinated on a national basis under the auspices of [[Siderbr\u00e1s]], the national steel monopoly.  The state had far less involvement in the non-flat steel sector, which has traditionally been made up of smaller [[private sector]] companies.  The larger integrated flat steel producers operated as semiautonomous companies under the control of Siderbr\u00e1s and were individually privatized during 1991 to 1993.\n\n====Proposed merger/acquisition with Corus====\n:''Main article [[Corus Group plc|Corus \u00a7 Takeover]]''\nIn 2006 CSN made a rival bid to acquire the Anglo-Dutch steel firm [[Corus Group plc|Corus]], following an announcement the acquisition of Corus by [[Tata Steel]] of India for $8.1 billion (\u00a34.5 billion, or \u00a34.55 per share). Competitive bidding between the two companies raised the final price to \u00a36.08 per share in 2007, with Tata outbidding CSN.\n\nCSN and Corus had earlier been partners in a Portuguese venture until early this year, when Corus sold its stake to CSN.{{when|date=April 2016}}{{clarifyme|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:CSN01.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view of the Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional, in the Center of the city of Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]\nCSN primarily operates as an integrated steel producer in Brazil. It produces a line of steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot-rolled products comprising heavy-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets, and light-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy.  The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products.  CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies.  The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors.  It is considered one of the most productive steel-makers in the world, producing more than 6 million tons of raw steel and more than 5 million tons of laminates per year.\n\n==Holdings==\nCSN owns different firms, such as GalvaSud (in [[Porto Real]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), Inal (in [[Mogi das Cruzes]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Barra Mansa]], Rio de Janeiro), CSN PARAN\u00c1 (in [[Arauc\u00e1ria]], [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]]) and container (TECON) and coal (TECAR) terminals in the Itagua\u00ed port (in [[Itagua\u00ed]], Rio de Janeiro). It also has control through shareholding in MRS Logistics, CFN, in railway transportation, the hydroelectric generators of Igarapava between the S\u00e3o Paulo and [[Minas Gerais]] states and It\u00e1, between [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] states, and factories in the [[United States]] and [[Portugal]].\n\n==Domestic government policies==\n{{refsection|date=April 2016}}\n===Anti-dumping, Countervailing Duties, Safeguards and Government Protectionism===\nProtectionist measures adopted by the governments in some of CSN's main markets could adversely affect crucial [[export]] sales. In response to the increased production and exports of steel in many countries, [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]], [[countervailing duties]] and safeguard measures have been imposed by countries which represent some of the main markets for CSN exports.  Those, and similar, measures could provoke an imbalance in the international steel market, which could adversely affect CSN's exports.\n\n===Potential Costs of Environmental Compliance; Mining Regulation===\nNew environmental standards imposed on CSN may require capital expenditures that do not increase productivity.  CSN's steel-making facilities are subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and permit requirements in Brazil relating to the protection of human health and the environment.\n\n===Dependence on Water Source===\nLarge amounts of water are required in the production of steel.  CSN's principal source of water is the [[Para\u00edba do Sul]] river, which runs through the city of Volta Redonda.  Much of the water is recirculated, and some, after processing, is returned to the Para\u00edba do Sul river.  A law passed in 1997 permits the Brazilian government to charge for water usage from water courses.\n\n'''Brazilian government policies in the energy sector may have an adverse impact on the cost or supply of electricity for CSN aluminum-related and ferroalloy operations.'''\n\n'''Tax and Social Security Reforms May Affect the Brazilian Economy, and May Impose a Higher Tax Burden on CSN.'''\n\nThe Brazilian Federal Congress has recently amended the Brazilian Constitution to modify certain aspects of the social security and [[tax]] system.  Moreover, the Brazilian Federal Congress is currently reviewing additional bills which would introduce further changes to Brazil's tax and social security laws.  Such reforms may affect Brazilian economic conditions generally, and may impose a higher tax burden on CSN.  If CSN is not able to pass the cost of such potential higher tax and social security burdens to  customers, their profit margins may be adversely affected.\n\n===Mining Concessions===\nCSN mining operations are governed by the Brazilian Constitution and the Mining Code and are subject to the laws, rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Constitution and the Code. Under the Brazilian Constitution, all mineral resources belong to Brazil.  CSN mining activities at the Casa de Pedra mine are based on holding of a Manifesto de Mina, which gives them full ownership over the mineral deposits existing within their property limits.  CSN mining activities at the [[Bocaina]] mine are based on a concession which gives them the right to mine for as long as ore reserves exist.\n\n===Fluctuation of the Real Exchange Controls===\nFluctuation in the [[exchange rate]] of the real can adversely affect CSN earnings.  Historically, emerging markets, including Brazil, have experienced [[devaluation]] of their currency at various times.  In 2002, the Brazilian exchange rate fluctuated from a low of R$2.2709 per US$1.00 to a high of R$3.9552 per US$1.00.  On June 6, 2005, the rate was R$2,4576 per US$1.00.  The real depreciated against the U.S. dollar approximately 2.3% in 2002, due in part to the continued economic and political uncertainties in Brazil and other emerging markets and the global economic slowdown.  In 2003 and 2004, the real appreciated 18.2% and 8.1%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar.  In the first quarter of 2005 the real depreciated 1% against the U.S. dollar.  Further fluctuations in the Brazilian currency, in relation to the U.S. dollar or other currencies, may have an adverse effect on CSN's financial condition and results, increasing the cost in [[Brazilian real|real]]s of CSN's foreign currency denominated borrowings and imports of raw materials, particularly coal and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]].\n\n===Inflation and Interest Rate Risks===\nHigh [[inflation]] rates have in the past had negative effects on the Brazilian economy and CSN's business.  During 2002, the Central Bank raised Brazil's base [[interest rate]] by a total of 7.5% to 26.5% as a result of the growing economic crisis in [[Argentina]], one of Brazil's primary trading partners, the lower level of growth of the U.S. economy and the economic uncertainty caused by the Brazilian presidential elections, among other factors.  During 2003, the Central Bank decreased Brazil's interest rate from 26.5% to 16.5%, reflecting the good momentum and inflation stability in line with the Central Bank's inflation target.  During 2004, the Central Bank increased Brazil's base interest rate by 1.25% to 17.75%, on concerns that growth in Brazil's gross domestic product could jeopardize the inflation target.\n\n==Competition==\nThe main competition of CSN in Brazil are [[Arcelor]] Brazil, Metallurgica [[Gerdau]], Companhia Sider\u00fargica Paulista (COSIPA), [[Usiminas]] and CST-Brazil.\nThe primary competitive factors in the domestic market include quality, price, payment terms and customer service.  Although CSN competes with other integrated Brazilian steel mills, it has not experienced significant [[import]] competition in Brazil from foreign steel companies.  Several foreign steel companies, however, are significant investors in Brazilian steel mills.\n\nCSN has these competitive advantages over its Brazilian competitors:\n\n\u2022 Its focus on selling high margin products, such as tin plate, pre-painted, galvalume and galvanized products, in its product mix.\n\u2022 It owns its iron ore reserves, compared to domestic competitors who purchase their iron ore requirements (mainly from [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]]).\n\u2022 It has a well-developed [[logistics]] infrastructure, from the iron ore mine to its steel mill and its own ports.\n\u2022 It is self-sufficient in energy, through the [[hydroelectric]] plants of [[It\u00e1 Hydroelectric Power Plant|It\u00e1]] and Igarapava, and its own [[thermoelectric]] plant inside the Volta Redonda mill.\n\u2022 GalvaSud, a 100% subsidiary of CSN, provides material for exposed auto parts, using hot-dip galvanized steel and laser-welded blanks, a trend in this industry.  This, together with the hot-dip galvanizing process know-how of CSN, allows them to dominate the automotive segment.\n\u2022 CSN Paran\u00e1, another subsidiary of CSN, provides additional capacity to produce high-quality galvanized, galvalume and pre-painted steel products for the construction and home appliance industries.\n\nBeing a Brazilian company, principal competitive advantages of CSN  are its abundant supply of low-cost, high-grade iron ore, low-cost labor and energy resources, and good quality of its infrastructure (railways and ports, mainly).  It is also benefited from a vast internal market present in Brazil with a large growth potential.  As a result of these advantages, CSN has one of the lowest steel production costs in the world.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1988 CSN strike]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061125004412/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BEK/is_7_13/ai_n14931175 Arms of iron and steel: Brazil's CSN looks to become a global iron miner while expanding its steel operations abroad]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031122123926/http://csna0004.csn.com.br/portal/page?_pageid=1004%2C89859&_dad=ebiz&_schema=PORTAL Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional] ''Official Site''\n\n{{Ibovespa companies}}\n{{S&P Latin America 40}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Companhia Siderurgica Nacional}}\n[[Category:Privatized companies of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1941]]\n[[Category:Cement companies of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Steel companies of Brazil]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in Brazil]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company \n|name = Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN)\n|logo = [[Image:Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional logo.svg|180px]] |\n|type = [[S.A.

CSN also owns its own source of [[iron]] ore.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Sede da CSN.jpg|250px|thumb|right|CSN Central Office in [[Volta Redonda]]. {{deletable image-caption}}]] -->\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and expansion (1941-1980)===\n[[File:Constru\u00e7\u00e3o da Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN).tif|thumb|250px|right|Construction of Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN) in 1941.]]\n[[File:Inaugura\u00e7\u00e3o pelo Presidente Eurico Gaspar Dutra da Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN).tif|thumb|250px|right|Inauguration by President Eurico Gaspar Dutra of Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional (CSN) in 1946.]]\nCompanhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional was created as a state-owned company on April 9, 1941, during the \"[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|''Estado Novo'' era]]\", during the term of Brazilian president, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], after an agreement between the [[United States|American]] and the Brazilian governments (see the [[Washington Accords (1942)|Washington Accords]]) for the construction of a facility that would provide steel for the Allies during the Second World War and later be an aid for Brazil's development.  It began its operations in 1946, under [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]'s presidency.\n\nCSN was a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941 pursuant to a decree of Brazilian President Get\u00falio Vargas.  The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located at Volta Redonda, in Rio de Janeiro State, started production in 1946.  It initially produced coke, pig iron castings and long products.  Two major expansions were undertaken at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks during the 1970s.  The first, completed in 1974, increased installed annual production capacity to 1.6 million tons of crude steel.  The second, completed in 1977, raised capacity to 2.4 million tons of crude steel.\n\n===1980 - 2005 ===\nCSN underwent another expansion  in 1989, increasing capacity to 4.5 million tons of crude steel.  The company was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% interest in the company.\n\nIn 1993, CSN adopted a capital improvement program, which was revised and extended in 1995.  The goals were: an increase in annual production of crude steel; improvement in productivity, increase in the quality of the products, and enhancement of the environmental protection and cleanup programs.  Since February 1996, all production has been based on the [[continuous casting]] process, rather than ingot casting, an alternative method that results in higher energy use and metal loss.  From 1996 through 2002, CSN spent the equivalent of US$2.4 billion under the capital improvement program and for operational capacity maintenance, culminating with the revamping in 2001 of Blast Furnace #3 and Hot Strip Mill #2 at the Presidente Vargas Steelworks increasing  annual production capacity to 5.6 million tons of crude steel and 5.1 million tons of rolled products, from approximately 5.0 million tons in each case.\n\nIn 2005 reinforced its position as the largest iron-mining operation in the country, through a controlling stake in [[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]] (CVRD).{{fact|date=April 2016}}{{disputed-inline|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn January 2004, the CSN board announced the approval of investments up to US$820 million to be made through 2007, including: expansion of production at the Casa de Pedra iron ore mine from 15.5 to approximately 40 million tons; expansion of the [[coal]] terminal adjacent to the [[Sepetiba]] Port facilities to enable annual exports of up to 30 million tons of iron ore; and the construction of a six million-ton pellet plant. The company also explored opportunities for acquisitions or mergers abroad in order to expand output, and proposed to build a new steel plant which would have doubled current annual production of 5.8 million tons of raw steel, at an estimated investment cost of US$2.6 billion.  Seeking to maintain focus on its program of acquisitions and growth, CSN set aside $520 million for investments in 2005.\n\n===Privatization ( 1993-present )===\nIn 1993 the company was privatized by [[Itamar Franco]]'s government, during the National Program for Privatization led by the federal government, started by [[Fernando Collor]] and continued by Franco.<ref>Arquivo Nacional (Brasil), ''Os Presidentes e a Rep\u00fablica: Deodoro da Fonseca a Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva'', 2\u00aa ed., Rio de Janeiro, 2003, pg. 189.</ref>\n\nIts main factories were located in Volta Redonda, at the Vale do Para\u00edba region, southern [[Rio de Janeiro]] state, and its iron mines at Congonhas and Arcos, both of them cities in the Minas Gerais state, and the coal mines at Sider\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina state.\n\nDuring almost 50 years of state control, the Brazilian flat steel sector was coordinated on a national basis under the auspices of [[Siderbr\u00e1s]], the national steel monopoly.  The state had far less involvement in the non-flat steel sector, which has traditionally been made up of smaller [[private sector]] companies.  The larger integrated flat steel producers operated as semiautonomous companies under the control of Siderbr\u00e1s and were individually privatized during 1991 to 1993.\n\n====Proposed merger/acquisition with Corus====\n:''Main article [[Corus Group plc|Corus \u00a7 Takeover]]''\nIn 2006 CSN made a rival bid to acquire the Anglo-Dutch steel firm [[Corus Group plc|Corus]], following an announcement the acquisition of Corus by [[Tata Steel]] of India for $8.1 billion (\u00a34.5 billion, or \u00a34.55 per share). Competitive bidding between the two companies raised the final price to \u00a36.08 per share in 2007, with Tata outbidding CSN.\n\nCSN and Corus had earlier been partners in a Portuguese venture until early this year, when Corus sold its stake to CSN.{{when|date=April 2016}}{{clarifyme|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:CSN01.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view of the Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional, in the Center of the city of Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]\nCSN primarily operates as an integrated steel producer in Brazil. It produces a line of steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot-rolled products comprising heavy-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets, and light-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy.  The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products.  CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies.  The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors.  It is considered one of the most productive steel-makers in the world, producing more than 6 million tons of raw steel and more than 5 million tons of laminates per year.\n\n==Holdings==\nCSN owns different firms, such as GalvaSud (in [[Porto Real]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), Inal (in [[Mogi das Cruzes]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Barra Mansa]], Rio de Janeiro), CSN PARAN\u00c1 (in [[Arauc\u00e1ria]], [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]]) and container (TECON) and coal (TECAR) terminals in the Itagua\u00ed port (in [[Itagua\u00ed]], Rio de Janeiro). It also has control through shareholding in MRS Logistics, CFN, in railway transportation, the hydroelectric generators of Igarapava between the S\u00e3o Paulo and [[Minas Gerais]] states and It\u00e1, between [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] states, and factories in the [[United States]] and [[Portugal]].\n\n==Domestic government policies==\n{{refsection|date=April 2016}}\n===Anti-dumping, Countervailing Duties, Safeguards and Government Protectionism===\nProtectionist measures adopted by the governments in some of CSN's main markets could adversely affect crucial [[export]] sales. In response to the increased production and exports of steel in many countries, [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]], [[countervailing duties]] and safeguard measures have been imposed by countries which represent some of the main markets for CSN exports.  Those, and similar, measures could provoke an imbalance in the international steel market, which could adversely affect CSN's exports.\n\n===Potential Costs of Environmental Compliance; Mining Regulation===\nNew environmental standards imposed on CSN may require capital expenditures that do not increase productivity.  CSN's steel-making facilities are subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and permit requirements in Brazil relating to the protection of human health and the environment.\n\n===Dependence on Water Source===\nLarge amounts of water are required in the production of steel.  CSN's principal source of water is the [[Para\u00edba do Sul]] river, which runs through the city of Volta Redonda.  Much of the water is recirculated, and some, after processing, is returned to the Para\u00edba do Sul river.  A law passed in 1997 permits the Brazilian government to charge for water usage from water courses.\n\n'''Brazilian government policies in the energy sector may have an adverse impact on the cost or supply of electricity for CSN aluminum-related and ferroalloy operations.'''\n\n'''Tax and Social Security Reforms May Affect the Brazilian Economy, and May Impose a Higher Tax Burden on CSN.'''\n\nThe Brazilian Federal Congress has recently amended the Brazilian Constitution to modify certain aspects of the social security and [[tax]] system.  Moreover, the Brazilian Federal Congress is currently reviewing additional bills which would introduce further changes to Brazil's tax and social security laws.  Such reforms may affect Brazilian economic conditions generally, and may impose a higher tax burden on CSN.  If CSN is not able to pass the cost of such potential higher tax and social security burdens to  customers, their profit margins may be adversely affected.\n\n===Mining Concessions===\nCSN mining operations are governed by the Brazilian Constitution and the Mining Code and are subject to the laws, rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Constitution and the Code. Under the Brazilian Constitution, all mineral resources belong to Brazil.  CSN mining activities at the Casa de Pedra mine are based on holding of a Manifesto de Mina, which gives them full ownership over the mineral deposits existing within their property limits.  CSN mining activities at the [[Bocaina]] mine are based on a concession which gives them the right to mine for as long as ore reserves exist.\n\n===Fluctuation of the Real Exchange Controls===\nFluctuation in the [[exchange rate]] of the real can adversely affect CSN earnings.  Historically, emerging markets, including Brazil, have experienced [[devaluation]] of their currency at various times.  In 2002, the Brazilian exchange rate fluctuated from a low of R$2.2709 per US$1.00 to a high of R$3.9552 per US$1.00.  On June 6, 2005, the rate was R$2,4576 per US$1.00.  The real depreciated against the U.S. dollar approximately 2.3% in 2002, due in part to the continued economic and political uncertainties in Brazil and other emerging markets and the global economic slowdown.  In 2003 and 2004, the real appreciated 18.2% and 8.1%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar.  In the first quarter of 2005 the real depreciated 1% against the U.S. dollar.  Further fluctuations in the Brazilian currency, in relation to the U.S. dollar or other currencies, may have an adverse effect on CSN's financial condition and results, increasing the cost in [[Brazilian real|real]]s of CSN's foreign currency denominated borrowings and imports of raw materials, particularly coal and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]].\n\n===Inflation and Interest Rate Risks===\nHigh [[inflation]] rates have in the past had negative effects on the Brazilian economy and CSN's business.  During 2002, the Central Bank raised Brazil's base [[interest rate]] by a total of 7.5% to 26.5% as a result of the growing economic crisis in [[Argentina]], one of Brazil's primary trading partners, the lower level of growth of the U.S. economy and the economic uncertainty caused by the Brazilian presidential elections, among other factors.  During 2003, the Central Bank decreased Brazil's interest rate from 26.5% to 16.5%, reflecting the good momentum and inflation stability in line with the Central Bank's inflation target.  During 2004, the Central Bank increased Brazil's base interest rate by 1.25% to 17.75%, on concerns that growth in Brazil's gross domestic product could jeopardize the inflation target.\n\n==Competition==\nThe main competition of CSN in Brazil are [[Arcelor]] Brazil, Metallurgica [[Gerdau]], Companhia Sider\u00fargica Paulista (COSIPA), [[Usiminas]] and CST-Brazil.\nThe primary competitive factors in the domestic market include quality, price, payment terms and customer service.  Although CSN competes with other integrated Brazilian steel mills, it has not experienced significant [[import]] competition in Brazil from foreign steel companies.  Several foreign steel companies, however, are significant investors in Brazilian steel mills.\n\nCSN has these competitive advantages over its Brazilian competitors:\n\n\u2022 Its focus on selling high margin products, such as tin plate, pre-painted, galvalume and galvanized products, in its product mix.\n\u2022 It owns its iron ore reserves, compared to domestic competitors who purchase their iron ore requirements (mainly from [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]]).\n\u2022 It has a well-developed [[logistics]] infrastructure, from the iron ore mine to its steel mill and its own ports.\n\u2022 It is self-sufficient in energy, through the [[hydroelectric]] plants of [[It\u00e1 Hydroelectric Power Plant|It\u00e1]] and Igarapava, and its own [[thermoelectric]] plant inside the Volta Redonda mill.\n\u2022 GalvaSud, a 100% subsidiary of CSN, provides material for exposed auto parts, using hot-dip galvanized steel and laser-welded blanks, a trend in this industry.  This, together with the hot-dip galvanizing process know-how of CSN, allows them to dominate the automotive segment.\n\u2022 CSN Paran\u00e1, another subsidiary of CSN, provides additional capacity to produce high-quality galvanized, galvalume and pre-painted steel products for the construction and home appliance industries.\n\nBeing a Brazilian company, principal competitive advantages of CSN  are its abundant supply of low-cost, high-grade iron ore, low-cost labor and energy resources, and good quality of its infrastructure (railways and ports, mainly).  It is also benefited from a vast internal market present in Brazil with a large growth potential.  As a result of these advantages, CSN has one of the lowest steel production costs in the world.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1988 CSN strike]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061125004412/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BEK/is_7_13/ai_n14931175 Arms of iron and steel: Brazil's CSN looks to become a global iron miner while expanding its steel operations abroad]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031122123926/http://csna0004.csn.com.br/portal/page?_pageid=1004%2C89859&_dad=ebiz&_schema=PORTAL Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional] ''Official Site''\n\n{{Ibovespa companies}}\n{{S&P Latin America 40}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Companhia Siderurgica Nacional}}\n[[Category:Privatized companies of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1941]]\n[[Category:Cement companies of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Steel companies of Brazil]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in Brazil]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companhia_Sider%C3%BArgica_Nacional"}

It is named after the [[New York City Police Department]]'s accountability process and has since been implemented by many other police departments, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nCompstat offers a dynamic approach to [[crime]] reduction, [[quality of life]] improvement, and personnel and resource management, whereby ranking police department executives identify spikes in crimes using comparative statistics and address those spikes through the use of targeted enforcement. To this end, Compstat includes four generally recognized components: timely and accurate information or intelligence, rapid deployment of resources, effective tactics, and relentless follow-up. However, Compstat can be expanded and tweaked depending on specific department needs. Originally, it was modeled after the [[broken windows theory]], whereby minor crimes would be addressed in order to reduce major crimes. However, over time, its use evolved into a system whereby productivity was measured and individuals were held accountable for spikes in crime. Commercial entities began producing [[turnkey]] packages (including computer systems, software, mobile devices, and other implements) assembled under the heading of CompStat. For example, [[Geographic Information System]]s allow departments to [[crime mapping|map crime]] or other types of data, to aid in identifying and solving problems in their assigned area.\n\n==Examples of police departments that use Compstat==\n\n===Canada===\n* [[Halifax Regional Police]]\n* [[Vancouver Police Department]]\n\n===United States===\n*[[Austin]], TX<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.ci.austin.tx.us/police/reports.htm\n|title=Chief's Monthly Reports\n|publisher=City of Austin\n|accessdate=2010-03-29\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630070419/https://www.ci.austin.tx.us/police/reports.htm\n|archive-date=2011-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n*[[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore, MD]], where the system is called Citistat.<ref name=\"baltimorecity1\">{{cite web\n|url=http://baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/CitiStat.aspx\n|title=Baltimore CitiStat\n|publisher=City of Baltimore\n|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> In 2007, then Governor of Maryland [[Martin O'Malley]] implemented [[Maryland StateStat]], the first statewide performance management system based on Compstat.\n\n*[[Los Angeles]], CA<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lapdonline.org/crime_maps_and_compstat/content_basic_view/6363\n|title= COMPSTAT |publisher=The Los Angeles Police Department\n|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>\n\n*[[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville, TN]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashville.gov/Police-Department/Chief-of-Police/Strategic-Development/Crime-Analysis.aspx |title=Nashville > Police Department > Chief of Police > Strategic Development > Crime Analysis |website=Nashville.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n*[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Bass |first=Paul |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/compstat_meeting/ |title=CompStat Ramps Up |publisher=New Haven Independent |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n*[[Oakland, California|Oakland, CA]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/police/documents/webcontent/oak045373.pdf\n|title=District-Based Investigations in Oakland: Rapid and Effective Responses to Robberies, Burglaries and Shootings\n|publisher=The Bratton Group, LLC\n|date=2013-05-01\n|accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n*[[Philadelphia]], PA<ref>{{cite web\n|title=CompStat Process\n|url=http://www.ppdonline.org/hq_compstat.php\n|publisher=Philadelphia Police Department\n|accessdate=2010-03-29\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310002138/http://www.ppdonline.org/hq_compstat.php\n|archivedate=March 10, 2010\n}}  </ref>\n\n*[[San Francisco]], CA<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=3254\n|title=SFPD CompStat\n|publisher=San Francisco Police Department\n|accessdate=2010-03-29\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408001247/http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=3254\n|archive-date=2010-04-08\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n*[[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/us/21crime.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lizette | last=Alvarez | title=Murder Rate and Fear Rise in Puerto Rico | date=2011-06-20}}</ref>\n*[[Washington, DC]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/site/default.asp?mpdcNav_GID=1523&mpdcNav=%7c31417|title=COMPSTAT|publisher=The Metropolitan Police Department Washington, DC|accessdate=2010-04-24}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*[[Detroit, MI]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2013/08/detroit_police_department_take.html | work=MLive |title=Detroit Police Department takes data-driven approach to crime fighting | date=2013-08-01}}</ref>\n*[[New York City|New York, NY]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/compstat.page|title=Crime Stats - COMPStat - NYPD|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2018-08-19}}</ref> where statistics are available to the public through the [https://compstat.nypdonline.org/ NYPD CompStat 2.0 Website].\n*[[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa, ID]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/crime/nampa-police-compstat-crime-rates-drop/277-a54c0e95-eefc-4b96-a9de-274c6947cd2a|title=Police: Crime decreasing in Nampa following change to CompStat policing|website=KTVB|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nCompStat was started under the direction of  [[Jack Maple]] when he was a [[transit police]] officer in New York City. The system  was called Charts of the Future and was simple \u2013 it tracked crime through pins stuck in maps. Charts of the Future is credited with cutting subway crime by 27 percent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe original commanding officer of the Transit Police Crime Analysis Unit was Lieutenant Richard Vasconi. Chief of New York City Transit Police [[William J. Bratton]] was later appointed police commissioner by [[Rudolph Giuliani]], and he brought Maple's Charts of the Future with him. Not without a bit of struggle, he made the NYPD adopt it after it was rebranded as '''CompStat''', and it was credited with bringing down crime by 60%.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} There was a CompStat meeting every month, and it was mandatory for police officials to attend. The year after CompStat was adopted, 1995, murders dropped to 1,181. By 2003, there were 596 murders\u2014the lowest number since 1964.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Operations==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}\n===Weekly crime reports===\nOn a weekly basis, personnel from each of the NYPD's 77 precincts, nine police service areas and 12 transit districts compile a statistical summary of the week's crime complaints, arrests and summons activity, as well as a written report of significant cases, crime patterns and police activities. This data, with specific crime and enforcement locations and times, is forwarded to the chief of the department's CompStat Unit, where information is collated and loaded into a citywide database.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe unit runs computer analysis on the data and generates a weekly CompStat report. The report captures crime complaints and arrest activity at the precinct, patrol borough and citywide levels, presenting a summary of these and other important performance indicators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe data is presented on a week-to-date, prior 28 days and year-to-date basis, with comparisons to previous years' activity. Precinct commanders and members of the agency's top management can easily discern emerging and established crime trends, as well as deviations and anomalies. With the report, department leadership can easily make comparisons between commands. Each precinct is also ranked in each complaint and arrest category.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Accountability===\nThe CompStat program involves weekly crime control strategy meetings. These gatherings increase information flow between the agency's executives and the commanders of operational units, with particular emphasis on  crime and quality of life enforcement information. In the department's vernacular, these briefings are referred to as CompStat (\"computerized statistics\") meetings, since many of the discussions are based upon the [[statistics|statistical]] analysis and [[map]]s contained within the weekly CompStat reports.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThese meetings and the information sharing they generate are an important part of Bratton's comprehensive, interactive management strategy: enhancing accountability by providing local commanders with considerable discretion and resources. The program also ensures that precinct commanders remain aware of crime and quality of life conditions within their areas of responsibility. By meeting frequently and discussing the department's ten crime and quality of life strategies, the initiatives are fully implemented throughout the agency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nPrecinct and other operational unit commanders use this forum to communicate with the agency's top executives and other commanders, sharing the problems they face and successful crime reduction tactics. The process allows top executives to monitor issues and activities within precincts and operational units, evaluating the skills and effectiveness of middle managers. By keeping abreast of situations \"on the ground,\" departmental leaders can properly allocate resources to most effectively reduce crime and improve police performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIt is important to note that the weekly CompStat report and crime strategy meetings do not focus simply on enforcement of the seven major crimes comprising the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) Index, but also capture data on the number of shooting incidents and shooting victims, as well as gun arrests. Summons and arrest activity are also captured.\n\n====In concert with broken windows theory====\nBy arresting or issuing summonses to people who engage in minor violations and quality of life offenses \u2014 such as public drinking and public urination, [[begging|panhandling]], loud radios, [[prostitution]] and disorderly conduct \u2014 ensures that those behaviors are deterred. As explained in the [[Broken windows theory]], aggressive enforcement of all statutes has been claimed to restore a sense of order. By capturing enforcement data as reflected in summons and arrest activity, the department is better able to gauge its overall performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Commander profile reports===\nThe CompStat Unit also develops and prepares commander profile reports. These weekly reports help executives scrutinize commanders' performance on a variety of important management variables. All profiles furnish information about the unit commander's appointment date and years in rank, the education and specialized training he or she has received, his or her most recent performance evaluation rating, and the units he or she previously commanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nEvery profile also captures some non-crime statistics: the amount of overtime generated by members of the command, the number of department vehicle accidents, absence rates due to sick time and line-of-duty injuries, and the number of civilian complaints logged against members of the unit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nCommunity demographics and information on the unit's personnel is also included. With this data, executives can monitor and assess how commanders motivate and manage their personnel resources and how well they address important management concerns. The commander profile also acts as a motivational tool; profile subjects are familiar with the criteria used to evaluate them\u2014and their peers\u2014enabling report subjects to monitor and compare their own success in meeting performance objectives with others' achievements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Crime strategy meetings===\nCrime strategy meetings are convened twice weekly in the Command and Control Center, a high-tech conference facility at police headquarters. These meetings are attended by all commanders of precincts, police service areas, transit districts and other operational unit commanders within a given patrol borough, including the commanding officers and /or supervisors of precinct-based and specialized investigative units. Depending on their weekly crime statistics, every commander can expect to be called at random to make his or her Crime Strategy Meeting presentation approximately once a month.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAlso in attendance are representatives from the respective district attorney's offices, command personnel from the department's School Safety Division and a variety of other outside agencies involved in law enforcement activities, the Transit and Housing Bureau commanders whose jurisdictions lie within the patrol borough, the Crime Strategy Coordinators from other patrol boroughs, Internal Affairs Bureau personnel, and ranking officers from a variety of support and ancillary units (such as the Legal Bureau and Management Information Systems Division) which do not perform direct enforcement functions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThis configuration of participants fosters a team approach to problem solving, and ensures that crime and quality of life problems identified at the meeting can be immediately discussed and quickly addressed through the development and implementation of creative and comprehensive solutions. Because ranking decision-makers are present at the meetings and can immediately commit their resources, the obstacles and delays which often occur in highly structured bureaucratic organizations also tend to be minimized.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAmong the Command and Control Center's high-tech capabilities is its computerized \"pin mapping\" which displays crime, arrest and quality of life data in a host of visual formats including comparative charts, graphs and tables. Through the use of geographic mapping software and other computer technology, for example, the CompStat database can be accessed and a precinct map depicting virtually any combination of crime and/or arrest locations, crime \"hot spots\" and other relevant information can be instantly projected on the Center's large video projection screens.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nComparative charts, tables and graphs can also be projected simultaneously. These visual presentations are a useful and highly effective adjunct to the CompStat Report, since it permits precinct commanders and members of the Executive Staff to instantly identify and explore trends and patterns as well as solutions for crime and quality of life problems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDuring their presentation, members of the executive staff frequently ask commanders probing questions about crime and arrest activity as well as about specific cases and initiatives they have undertaken to reduce crime and enforce quality of life offenses. Commanders are expected to demonstrate a detailed knowledge of the crime and quality of life problems existing within their commands and to develop innovative and flexible tactics to address them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs noted above, the weekly COMPSTAT meetings are but one facet of the department's comprehensive system by which is monitored and used to evaluate the department's performance. There are also pre-COMPSTAT briefings convened at the local patrol borough level, Precinct Management Team meetings in each precinct and strategy evaluation projects conducted by ranking members of the department. In addition, the police commissioner meets with New York City's mayor on a weekly basis to brief them on the department's activities and performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe police commissioner also provides the mayor with a formal report capturing much of the data contained within the CompStat Report. Finally, a great deal of the CompStat data and other indices of performance are provided to the public through inclusion in the Mayor's Management Report. This report and the preliminary report issued four months into the fiscal year provide detailed comparative data on the performance of every mayoral agency within city government. The process permits personnel at all levels to monitor and assess the effectiveness of their efforts and re-direct those efforts when necessary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Technology===\nBecause it often relies on underlying software tools, CompStat has sometimes been confused for a software program in itself. This is a fundamental misconception. CompStat often does, however, incorporate [[crime mapping]] systems and a commercial or internally developed [[database]] collection system. In some cases, police departments have started offering information to the public through their own websites. In other cases, police departments can either create their own [[XML]] feed or use a third party to display data on a map.

As an illustration, before a department begins using CompStat it might list 100 assaults as aggravated and 500 as simple assault. If there were a similar pattern of underlying criminal activity the next year, but instead 550 assaults are listed in CompStat as simple and 50 as aggravated, the system would report that progress had been made reducing major crimes when in fact, the only difference is in how they are reported.\n\nManipulating reporting data may also negatively affect personnel and financial disbursement; communities whose improvements (on paper) show they need less resources could lose those resources\u2014and still face the same amount of actual crime on the streets.\n\nMany of these negative effects in the possible weaknesses of the COMPSTAT system were dramatized in [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Wire]]'', as part of an overarching theme of systemic dysfunction in institutions.<ref>Crime Stats From HBO to BSO ''Miami Herald'', 1B, December 6, 2004.</ref> Indeed, \"[o]ne of the central themes of the critically acclaimed HBO series . . . was the pressure [[politician]]s put on police brass, who then apply it to the department\u2019s middle management, to generate [[Public relations|PR]]-friendly statistics about lowering crime and increasing arrests.\"<ref>[[Radley Balko|Balko, Radley]] (2010-03-08) [http://reason.com/archives/2010/03/08/the-other-broken-window-fallac The Other Broken Windows Fallacy], ''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''</ref>  In the show, this was referred to as \"juking the stats\".\n\nThe issue was further publicized in 2010 when NYPD officer [[Adrian Schoolcraft]] released recordings of his superiors urging him to manipulate data.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/nyregion/10quotas.html|title=Secret Tape Has Police Pressing Ticket Quotas|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Parascandola |first=Rocco |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_cop_in_scandal_no_fines_no_jobs.html |title=Cop in scandal: No fines, no jobs |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|author=Colleen Long and Tom Hayes|date=October 9, 2010|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/10/09/national/a094224D52.DTL&ao=2#ixzz11yBYEM4N|title=Cop who made tapes accuses NYPD of false arrest}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Justice Quarterly published an article stating that there was statistical evidence of the NYPD manipulating CompStat data.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/justice%20quarterly%20article%20Eterno%20Verma%20Silverman.pdf|title=Police Manipulations of Crime Reporting: Insiders' Revelations|website=Justice Quarterly|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==TrafficStat==\nThe NYPD's TrafficStat was modeled after CompStat.

It is named after the [[New York City Police Department]]'s accountability process and has since been implemented by many other police departments, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nCompstat offers a dynamic approach to [[crime]] reduction, [[quality of life]] improvement, and personnel and resource management, whereby ranking police department executives identify spikes in crimes using comparative statistics and address those spikes through the use of targeted enforcement. To this end, Compstat includes four generally recognized components: timely and accurate information or intelligence, rapid deployment of resources, effective tactics, and relentless follow-up. However, Compstat can be expanded and tweaked depending on specific department needs. Originally, it was modeled after the [[broken windows theory]], whereby minor crimes would be addressed in order to reduce major crimes. However, over time, its use evolved into a system whereby productivity was measured and individuals were held accountable for spikes in crime. Commercial entities began producing [[turnkey]] packages (including computer systems, software, mobile devices, and other implements) assembled under the heading of CompStat. For example, [[Geographic Information System]]s allow departments to [[crime mapping|map crime]] or other types of data, to aid in identifying and solving problems in their assigned area.\n\n==Examples of police departments that use Compstat==\n\n===Canada===\n* [[Halifax Regional Police]]\n* [[Vancouver Police Department]]\n\n===United States===\n*[[Austin]], TX<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.ci.austin.tx.us/police/reports.htm\n|title=Chief's Monthly Reports\n|publisher=City of Austin\n|accessdate=2010-03-29\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630070419/https://www.ci.austin.tx.us/police/reports.htm\n|archive-date=2011-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n*[[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore, MD]], where the system is called Citistat.<ref name=\"baltimorecity1\">{{cite web\n|url=http://baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/CitiStat.aspx\n|title=Baltimore CitiStat\n|publisher=City of Baltimore\n|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> In 2007, then Governor of Maryland [[Martin O'Malley]] implemented [[Maryland StateStat]], the first statewide performance management system based on Compstat.\n\n*[[Los Angeles]], CA<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lapdonline.org/crime_maps_and_compstat/content_basic_view/6363\n|title= COMPSTAT |publisher=The Los Angeles Police Department\n|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>\n\n*[[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville, TN]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashville.gov/Police-Department/Chief-of-Police/Strategic-Development/Crime-Analysis.aspx |title=Nashville > Police Department > Chief of Police > Strategic Development > Crime Analysis |website=Nashville.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n*[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Bass |first=Paul |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/compstat_meeting/ |title=CompStat Ramps Up |publisher=New Haven Independent |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n*[[Oakland, California|Oakland, CA]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/police/documents/webcontent/oak045373.pdf\n|title=District-Based Investigations in Oakland: Rapid and Effective Responses to Robberies, Burglaries and Shootings\n|publisher=The Bratton Group, LLC\n|date=2013-05-01\n|accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n*[[Philadelphia]], PA<ref>{{cite web\n|title=CompStat Process\n|url=http://www.ppdonline.org/hq_compstat.php\n|publisher=Philadelphia Police Department\n|accessdate=2010-03-29\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310002138/http://www.ppdonline.org/hq_compstat.php\n|archivedate=March 10, 2010\n}}  </ref>\n\n*[[San Francisco]], CA<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=3254\n|title=SFPD CompStat\n|publisher=San Francisco Police Department\n|accessdate=2010-03-29\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408001247/http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=3254\n|archive-date=2010-04-08\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n*[[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/us/21crime.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lizette | last=Alvarez | title=Murder Rate and Fear Rise in Puerto Rico | date=2011-06-20}}</ref>\n*[[Washington, DC]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/site/default.asp?mpdcNav_GID=1523&mpdcNav=%7c31417|title=COMPSTAT|publisher=The Metropolitan Police Department Washington, DC|accessdate=2010-04-24}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*[[Detroit, MI]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2013/08/detroit_police_department_take.html | work=MLive |title=Detroit Police Department takes data-driven approach to crime fighting | date=2013-08-01}}</ref>\n*[[New York City|New York, NY]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/compstat.page|title=Crime Stats - COMPStat - NYPD|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2018-08-19}}</ref> where statistics are available to the public through the [https://compstat.nypdonline.org/ NYPD CompStat 2.0 Website].\n*[[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa, ID]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/crime/nampa-police-compstat-crime-rates-drop/277-a54c0e95-eefc-4b96-a9de-274c6947cd2a|title=Police: Crime decreasing in Nampa following change to CompStat policing|website=KTVB|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nCompStat was started under the direction of  [[Jack Maple]] when he was a [[transit police]] officer in New York City. The system  was called Charts of the Future and was simple \u2013 it tracked crime through pins stuck in maps. Charts of the Future is credited with cutting subway crime by 27 percent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe original commanding officer of the Transit Police Crime Analysis Unit was Lieutenant Richard Vasconi. Chief of New York City Transit Police [[William J. Bratton]] was later appointed police commissioner by [[Rudolph Giuliani]], and he brought Maple's Charts of the Future with him. Not without a bit of struggle, he made the NYPD adopt it after it was rebranded as '''CompStat''', and it was credited with bringing down crime by 60%.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} There was a CompStat meeting every month, and it was mandatory for police officials to attend. The year after CompStat was adopted, 1995, murders dropped to 1,181. By 2003, there were 596 murders\u2014the lowest number since 1964.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Operations==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}\n===Weekly crime reports===\nOn a weekly basis, personnel from each of the NYPD's 77 precincts, nine police service areas and 12 transit districts compile a statistical summary of the week's crime complaints, arrests and summons activity, as well as a written report of significant cases, crime patterns and police activities. This data, with specific crime and enforcement locations and times, is forwarded to the chief of the department's CompStat Unit, where information is collated and loaded into a citywide database.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe unit runs computer analysis on the data and generates a weekly CompStat report. The report captures crime complaints and arrest activity at the precinct, patrol borough and citywide levels, presenting a summary of these and other important performance indicators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe data is presented on a week-to-date, prior 28 days and year-to-date basis, with comparisons to previous years' activity. Precinct commanders and members of the agency's top management can easily discern emerging and established crime trends, as well as deviations and anomalies. With the report, department leadership can easily make comparisons between commands. Each precinct is also ranked in each complaint and arrest category.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Accountability===\nThe CompStat program involves weekly crime control strategy meetings. These gatherings increase information flow between the agency's executives and the commanders of operational units, with particular emphasis on  crime and quality of life enforcement information. In the department's vernacular, these briefings are referred to as CompStat (\"computerized statistics\") meetings, since many of the discussions are based upon the [[statistics|statistical]] analysis and [[map]]s contained within the weekly CompStat reports.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThese meetings and the information sharing they generate are an important part of Bratton's comprehensive, interactive management strategy: enhancing accountability by providing local commanders with considerable discretion and resources. The program also ensures that precinct commanders remain aware of crime and quality of life conditions within their areas of responsibility. By meeting frequently and discussing the department's ten crime and quality of life strategies, the initiatives are fully implemented throughout the agency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nPrecinct and other operational unit commanders use this forum to communicate with the agency's top executives and other commanders, sharing the problems they face and successful crime reduction tactics. The process allows top executives to monitor issues and activities within precincts and operational units, evaluating the skills and effectiveness of middle managers. By keeping abreast of situations \"on the ground,\" departmental leaders can properly allocate resources to most effectively reduce crime and improve police performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIt is important to note that the weekly CompStat report and crime strategy meetings do not focus simply on enforcement of the seven major crimes comprising the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) Index, but also capture data on the number of shooting incidents and shooting victims, as well as gun arrests. Summons and arrest activity are also captured.\n\n====In concert with broken windows theory====\nBy arresting or issuing summonses to people who engage in minor violations and quality of life offenses \u2014 such as public drinking and public urination, [[begging|panhandling]], loud radios, [[prostitution]] and disorderly conduct \u2014 ensures that those behaviors are deterred. As explained in the [[Broken windows theory]], aggressive enforcement of all statutes has been claimed to restore a sense of order. By capturing enforcement data as reflected in summons and arrest activity, the department is better able to gauge its overall performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Commander profile reports===\nThe CompStat Unit also develops and prepares commander profile reports. These weekly reports help executives scrutinize commanders' performance on a variety of important management variables. All profiles furnish information about the unit commander's appointment date and years in rank, the education and specialized training he or she has received, his or her most recent performance evaluation rating, and the units he or she previously commanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nEvery profile also captures some non-crime statistics: the amount of overtime generated by members of the command, the number of department vehicle accidents, absence rates due to sick time and line-of-duty injuries, and the number of civilian complaints logged against members of the unit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nCommunity demographics and information on the unit's personnel is also included. With this data, executives can monitor and assess how commanders motivate and manage their personnel resources and how well they address important management concerns. The commander profile also acts as a motivational tool; profile subjects are familiar with the criteria used to evaluate them\u2014and their peers\u2014enabling report subjects to monitor and compare their own success in meeting performance objectives with others' achievements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Crime strategy meetings===\nCrime strategy meetings are convened twice weekly in the Command and Control Center, a high-tech conference facility at police headquarters. These meetings are attended by all commanders of precincts, police service areas, transit districts and other operational unit commanders within a given patrol borough, including the commanding officers and /or supervisors of precinct-based and specialized investigative units. Depending on their weekly crime statistics, every commander can expect to be called at random to make his or her Crime Strategy Meeting presentation approximately once a month.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAlso in attendance are representatives from the respective district attorney's offices, command personnel from the department's School Safety Division and a variety of other outside agencies involved in law enforcement activities, the Transit and Housing Bureau commanders whose jurisdictions lie within the patrol borough, the Crime Strategy Coordinators from other patrol boroughs, Internal Affairs Bureau personnel, and ranking officers from a variety of support and ancillary units (such as the Legal Bureau and Management Information Systems Division) which do not perform direct enforcement functions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThis configuration of participants fosters a team approach to problem solving, and ensures that crime and quality of life problems identified at the meeting can be immediately discussed and quickly addressed through the development and implementation of creative and comprehensive solutions. Because ranking decision-makers are present at the meetings and can immediately commit their resources, the obstacles and delays which often occur in highly structured bureaucratic organizations also tend to be minimized.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAmong the Command and Control Center's high-tech capabilities is its computerized \"pin mapping\" which displays crime, arrest and quality of life data in a host of visual formats including comparative charts, graphs and tables. Through the use of geographic mapping software and other computer technology, for example, the CompStat database can be accessed and a precinct map depicting virtually any combination of crime and/or arrest locations, crime \"hot spots\" and other relevant information can be instantly projected on the Center's large video projection screens.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nComparative charts, tables and graphs can also be projected simultaneously. These visual presentations are a useful and highly effective adjunct to the CompStat Report, since it permits precinct commanders and members of the Executive Staff to instantly identify and explore trends and patterns as well as solutions for crime and quality of life problems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDuring their presentation, members of the executive staff frequently ask commanders probing questions about crime and arrest activity as well as about specific cases and initiatives they have undertaken to reduce crime and enforce quality of life offenses. Commanders are expected to demonstrate a detailed knowledge of the crime and quality of life problems existing within their commands and to develop innovative and flexible tactics to address them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs noted above, the weekly COMPSTAT meetings are but one facet of the department's comprehensive system by which is monitored and used to evaluate the department's performance. There are also pre-COMPSTAT briefings convened at the local patrol borough level, Precinct Management Team meetings in each precinct and strategy evaluation projects conducted by ranking members of the department. In addition, the police commissioner meets with New York City's mayor on a weekly basis to brief them on the department's activities and performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe police commissioner also provides the mayor with a formal report capturing much of the data contained within the CompStat Report. Finally, a great deal of the CompStat data and other indices of performance are provided to the public through inclusion in the Mayor's Management Report. This report and the preliminary report issued four months into the fiscal year provide detailed comparative data on the performance of every mayoral agency within city government. The process permits personnel at all levels to monitor and assess the effectiveness of their efforts and re-direct those efforts when necessary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Technology===\nBecause it often relies on underlying software tools, CompStat has sometimes been confused for a software program in itself. This is a fundamental misconception. CompStat often does, however, incorporate [[crime mapping]] systems and a commercial or internally developed [[database]] collection system. In some cases, police departments have started offering information to the public through their own websites. In other cases, police departments can either create their own [[XML]] feed or use a third party to display data on a map. The largest of these is CrimeReports.com, used by thousands of agencies nationwide.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation for claim that CrimeReports is largest\u2026something|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Critique==\nSome, such as [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]], have argued that COMPSTAT's crime-reducing effects have been minor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf |format=PDF |title=Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not |author=Steven D.

As an illustration, before a department begins using CompStat it might list 100 assaults as aggravated and 500 as simple assault. If there were a similar pattern of underlying criminal activity the next year, but instead 550 assaults are listed in CompStat as simple and 50 as aggravated, the system would report that progress had been made reducing major crimes when in fact, the only difference is in how they are reported.\n\nManipulating reporting data may also negatively affect personnel and financial disbursement; communities whose improvements (on paper) show they need less resources could lose those resources\u2014and still face the same amount of actual crime on the streets.\n\nMany of these negative effects in the possible weaknesses of the COMPSTAT system were dramatized in [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Wire]]'', as part of an overarching theme of systemic dysfunction in institutions.<ref>Crime Stats From HBO to BSO ''Miami Herald'', 1B, December 6, 2004.</ref> Indeed, \"[o]ne of the central themes of the critically acclaimed HBO series . . . was the pressure [[politician]]s put on police brass, who then apply it to the department\u2019s middle management, to generate [[Public relations|PR]]-friendly statistics about lowering crime and increasing arrests.\"<ref>[[Radley Balko|Balko, Radley]] (2010-03-08) [http://reason.com/archives/2010/03/08/the-other-broken-window-fallac The Other Broken Windows Fallacy], ''[[Reason Magazine|Reason]]''</ref>  In the show, this was referred to as \"juking the stats\".\n\nThe issue was further publicized in 2010 when NYPD officer [[Adrian Schoolcraft]] released recordings of his superiors urging him to manipulate data.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/nyregion/10quotas.html|title=Secret Tape Has Police Pressing Ticket Quotas|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Parascandola |first=Rocco |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_cop_in_scandal_no_fines_no_jobs.html |title=Cop in scandal: No fines, no jobs |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|author=Colleen Long and Tom Hayes|date=October 9, 2010|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/10/09/national/a094224D52.DTL&ao=2#ixzz11yBYEM4N|title=Cop who made tapes accuses NYPD of false arrest}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Justice Quarterly published an article stating that there was statistical evidence of the NYPD manipulating CompStat data<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/justice%20quarterly%20article%20Eterno%20Verma%20Silverman.pdf|title=Police Manipulations of Crime Reporting: Insiders' Revelations|website=Justice Quarterly|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>.\n\n==TrafficStat==\nThe NYPD's TrafficStat was modeled after CompStat.

More specifically, \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m was traditionally spoken in Bute Inlet (also known as Church House), in Squirrel Cove (also known as Cortez Island), and in Sliammon, located in the area now known as Powell River.\n\nIt has two main dialects, Island Comox, associated with the [[K'omoks First Nation]], and Mainland Comox. Whereas there Comox speaks (Vancouver Island) Island dialect,  the [[Sliammon First Nation|Sliammon]], [[Klahoose First Nation|Klahoose]], and Homalco peoples speak \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m, which is referred to by some as \"Mainland Comox dialect\". As of 2012, the Island Comox dialect has no remaining speakers.<ref name=e21/> The term {{lang|kwk|comox}} is not a Comox word, but rather a Kwak'wala term meaning \"plenty\", \"abundance\", or \"wealth\u201d. So Comox is not an \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m term, but is Wakashan based.  \n\u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m means \u201cthe language of our people\u201d in Sliammon, Klahoose, and Homalco languages. \nEfforts to revitalize, rejuvenate, and revive \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m. In Powell River, Campbell River, and Cortez island have  started projects to help save  \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m. Children in daycare, preschool are being taught  \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m in schools on [[Cortez Island]], [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] (the current city where many of the Homalco people have resettled) and is now being taught in school district #47 ([[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]]). \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m is also being accepted as a second language that fulfills graduation requirements. In Powell River, \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m is taught from daycare through grade 12.\n\nA community accord was signed in 2003 between Sliammon First Nation and the municipality of Powell River. The municipality of Powell River has started to place the traditional Sliammon names in addition to the settler names on signs found throughout the district.\n\nA Sliammon [[iPhone]] app was released in March 2012. An online dictionary, phrasebook, and language learning portal is available at [[First Voices]]. In addition to the First Voices site, there are \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m dictionaries from Sliammon and Homalco, CD's containing  \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m and children's books containing The \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m language are available throughout [[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]], [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]], and [[Cortez Island]].\n\nMany Sliammon, Klahoose and Homalco do not identify as Comox, and Comox is seen by many separate and more closely linked to the kwakwaka'wakw people as Comox people speak this language. Island Comox became very rare in the late 1800\u2019s as Lekwiltok became the more common language spoken by the island Comox.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonants of Comox are depicted below in IPA and the [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist orthography]] of H.

Words often include lexical suffixes referring to concrete physical objects or abstract extensions from them.\"<ref>Smithsonian Institution handbook of North American Indians, Vol. 7 Northwest Coast, pp.33</ref>\n\nComox has essentially lost all derivational prefixes. It is the only language in the Salish family to have lost the nominalizing prefix ''s-'' from its morphological inventory (Kroeber 11).<ref name=\"kroeber\"/>\nHowever, the morphologically mirrored ''-s'' interestingly serves as a marker for 3rd person possession (Kroeber 111). Hag\u00e8ge has found certain cases where both the prefixive ''s-'' and the suffixive ''-s'' occur in circumspection. Kroeber is wary to support the finding, but offers the following: \"This would appear to be a complex of the nominalizing prefix ''s-'' and the third person possessive ''-s''; that is, the third person form of the sort of nominalized construction widely used for subordination in Salish.\"(Kroeber 115).\n\nIn his review of Hag\u00e8ge's grammar of the language,<ref>[[Claude Hag\u00e8ge|Hag\u00e8ge, Claude]].

Kroeber states, \"After diminutive CV reduplication, all CVC roots lose their vowel, regardless of what the vowel is.\" (109) Kroeber gives the following example: ''wot'-o-t'' 'bend it', ''wo-wt'-o-t'' 'bend it a little bit' (109).\n\nThe affixes representing possession in Comox are much different than those of their Salishan counterparts. 1st person singular (''\u00e7-'') and plural (''ms-'') and 2nd person singular (''\u03b8-'') appear as prefixes, while 2nd person plural (''-ap'') and 3rd person (''-s'') appear as suffixes (Kroeber 111).<ref>International Journal of American Linguistics Vol. 55 No. 1 Jan. 1989.</ref>\n\n==Grammatical categories==\n\n===Number===\n\n\"Reduplicated counting forms with explicit reference to 'people' can be found in a large number of different Salish languages. All the basic formal shapes of reduplication in Salish (CVC-, CV-, and \u2013VC) may be used to create the 'people' counting forms.\" (412).<ref>International Journal of American Linguistics , Vol. 65, No. 4 (Oct., 1999) , pp. 412\u2013420</ref>\n\nComox numbers for 'people':\n* 1 \u2013 ''p\u00e1\u0294a''\n* 2 \u2013 ''s\u00e1\u0294a''\n* 3 \u2013 ''\u010d\u00e1las''\n* 4 \u2013 ''mus''\n* 5 \u2013 ''s\u00edya\u010dix''\n* 6 \u2013 ''t'\u00e1xam''\n* 7 \u2013 ''c'o\u0294\u010dis''\n* 8 \u2013 ''t\u00e1\u0294\u010dis''\n* 9 \u2013 ''t\u00edgyixw''\n* 10 \u2013 ''\u00fapan''\n\nComox uses CV reduplication to mark its 'people' counting forms (419\u2013420).\n* ''p\u00ed-pa\u0294a'' ('1 person')\n* ''s\u00ed-sa\u0294a'' ('2 people')\n\n===Control===\n\n\"Control [volitional] may be seen as marking the subject of the verb as a prototypical agent: the subject wants the event to occur and has the capabilities that would normally ensure that (s)he could bring about the desired event. Noncontrol [nonvolitional] signals that the subject departs in some way from prototypical agentivity; the event occurs accidentally or is something that the subject did only with difficulty\" (Kroeber 155\u2013156).\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| t\u02bcu\u00e7\u02bc-ut-as\n|-\n| shoot-CTr-3Sb\n|}\n|-\n| 'he shot it (on purpose), tried to shoot it'\n|}\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| t\u02bcu\u00e7\u02bc-\u0259x\u02b7-as\n|-\n|shoot-NTr-3Sb\n|}\n|-\n| 'he shot it (accidentally), managed to shoot it'\n|}\n\nThe inceptive reduplication of Comox is closely tied to the marking of control. In words like ''tih'' 'big', -VC reduplicates to create the inceptive form ''tih-ih'' 'get big'.  Control is then marked by further affixation: \"The CTr suffix regularly has the form ''-at'' after \u2013VC\" (Kroeber 159).\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| x\u02b7ah-at-u\u026b || \u010d || tih-ih-at-as\n|-\n| tell-CTr-Past || 1sSb || big-VC-CTr-3Sb\n|}\n|-\n| 'I told him to make it big'\n|}\n\n===Duratives===\n\n\"The durative is used for activities carried out over an extended period or habitually, such as a means of employment\" (Mithun 168). Thus, duratives demonstrate intervallic aspect. Here is an example of a durative in Comox:\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| x\u02b7ux\u02b7-mut || \u0294u\u026bq\u02b7u\n|-\n| long.time-very || dig.clams\n|}\n|-\n| 'he dug clams for a long time'\n|}\n\n===Inceptive===\n\n\"An inceptive prefix can mark the gradual, beginning stages of an event or state\" (Mithun 169).<ref>International Journal of American Linguistics , Vol. 54, No. 2 (Apr., 1988) , pp. 141\u2013167</ref>  In Comox, this is largely achieved through \u2013VC reduplication. The following example illustrates this process:\n\n* ''p\u0259s-\u0259s'' 'get numb' (''p\u0259s'' 'numb')\n* ''tih-ih'' 'get big' (''tih'' 'big')\n\n===Syntax===\n\nAs is the case for all Salish languages, Comox is predicate-initial. Czaykowski-Higgins and Kinkade (1998) state, \"VSO (verb-subject-object) is most commonly said to be the preferred word order in most Salish languages, with postpredicate word order nevertheless being fairly free\" (37). Kroeber (1999) confirms this information and expounds upon it by stating, \"in all Salish languages, the predicate is most often clause-initial, followed by nominal expressions and prepositional phrases coding participants in the event\" (37). He further notes that prepositional phrases generally represent obliques, leaving subjects and objects unmarked (38).<ref name=\"kroeber\"/><ref>Czaykowski-Higgins, E., and Kinkade, M. D. (1998) Salish languages and linguistics: Theoretical and descriptive perspectives. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter.</ref>\n\n===Word Classification===\n\nIn addition to the loss of derivational prefixes, Comox has also lost the nominalizer prefix in many of its uses. Further, there is extant ambiguity as to the ability \u2013 or need \u2013 to classify certain words as 'noun' or 'verb' within the Salish family. An example of the uncertainty is the word ''\u0294i\u026ct\u0259n'', which can appear as both a noun and a verb, and is identified through the results of its affixation. Kroeber (1999) provides the following example:\n\nverb:\n\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| \u0294i\u026ct\u0259n || \u0294i\u026ct\u0259n\u203f\u010dx\u02b7\n|-\n| 'eat' || 'you eat'\n|}\n\nnoun:\n\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| \u0294i\u026ct\u0259n || t\u0259\u203f\u0294i\u026ct\u0259n-s\n|-\n| 'food' || 'his/her food'\n|}\n\nThe word ''\u0294i\u026ct\u0259n'' in these examples is semantically similar though grammatically contrasted. The suffixation present in the first instance marks the word as a verb and also indicates person, in this case the second. The prefix and suffix in the latter instance nominalize the word, possession designated as seen earlier by the suffix ''-s'' (34\u201335).<ref name=\"kroeber\">Kroeber, P. D. (1999) ''The Salish language family: Reconstructing syntax''. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.</ref>\n\n===Complements of Negative Predicates===\n\nIn Coast Salish languages, all but Squamish feature subject-predicate mirroring \u2013 a sort of clausal concord \u2013 in person and number. To illustrate this point, here are examples from Catlotlq and Squamish:\n\nCatlotlq \u2013\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| x\u02b7a\u0294\u203f\u010d || q\u0259jiy-an || p'ap'im\n|-\n| not\u203f1s.SU.CL || still-1s.CJ.SU || work\n|}\n|-\n| 'I'm not still working'\n|}\n\nSquamish \u2013\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| h\u00e1w || q\u203f\u0294an\u203fc'ic'\u00e1p || ti\u203fsc\u00ed\u0294s\n|-\n| not || IRR\u203f1s.CJ.SU\u203fwork || ART\u203ftoday\n|}\n|-\n| 'I do not work today'\n|}\n\nIn the Catlotlq example, the negating predicate assumes the same person and number as the subject. Conversely, the Squamish negating predicate remains unmarked. The difference between Squamish and Coast Salish languages in this case, is the irrealis marker ''q-'' on the subject, a common feature of non-Salish languages.<ref name=\"kroeber\"/>\n\n===Oblique===\n\nLike its fellow Coast Salish languages, Catlotlq utilizes a single preposition, ''\u0294\u0259'', to mark the oblique (Kroeber, 45). Below are two examples:\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| p\u0259q\u02b7s-a-t-as || \u0294\u0259\u203ft\u0259\u203fqa\u0294ya\n|-\n| enter.water-LV-TR-3.TR.SU || OBL\u203fART\u203fwater\n|}\n|-\n| 'He dropped it in the water'\n|}\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| hu\u203f\u0161t\u203f\u0259m || xapj-a-mi || (\u0294\u0259)\u203fk\u02b7\u0259\u203f\u03b8\u203ftuwa\n|-\n| go\u203f1p.SU.CL\u203fFUT || return-TR-2s.OB || OBL\u203fART\u203f2s.PO\u203fbe.from\n|}\n|-\n| 'We will send you back to where you came from'\n|}\n\nInterestingly, the oblique marker in these examples also serves a locative purpose, identifying where the object was dropped and the individual's original orientation. The subjects and objects in both phrases are, true to form, unmarked by preposition.\n\n===Transitivity===\n\nTransitivity in Catlotlq has several suffix paradigms. With respect to one of these paradigms, Harris states, \"object suffixes preced[ing] subject suffixes\" (50). He offers first a list of object pronouns as they appear with transitive roots and then gives examples of each of them in their respective environments.\n\nThe objective pronouns on transitive roots are:\n\n{|\n| ''-s-'' || me || ''-tulmo\u026b-'' || us\n|-\n| ''-s\u026a-'' || you(sg.) || ''-tanapi-'' || you(pl.)\n|-\n| ''-t-'' || him, her, it || ''-t(\u028cw?)-'' || them\n|}\n\nApplied to the root 'called':\n\n# ''y\u00e1\u026bas\u028cs''  He called me.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026bas\u026as''  He called you.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026bat\u02b0\u010dan''  I called him.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026batulmo\u026b\u028cs'' He called us.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026batanap\u026as''  He called you.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026batew\u0294\u010dan''  I called them.\n\nIn relation to transitivity, Catlotlq also demonstrates the benefactive suffix with the suffix ''\u0294\u028cm'' (Harris, 52). Following the objective pronouns given in the previous example, the next set of data (Harris, 53) illustrates the benefactive suffix:\n\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmsas''  He dug it for me.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cms\u026as''  He dug it for you.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtas''  He dug it for him.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtulmo\u026bas'' He dug it for us.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtanap\u026as'' He dug it for you (pl.).\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtasew\u0294'' He dug it for them.\n\nMithun (1999) explains: \"A benefactive applicative allows beneficiaries to be cast as direct objects\" (247). Thus, the transitivity not only denotes direction, but a benefactor and the recipient.\n\n===Tense===\n\n====Future====\n\nHarris (1981) states, \"there are three explicit tenses in Comox: the past, the present, and the future\" (72). He first looks at the future tense marked by the morpheme ''-s\u028cm'', noting that \"if the preceding pronoun ends in a [t] the [s] is dropped\" (73).\n\n# ''tahath\u010dxws\u028cm t\u028c kyut\u028cn''<br/>You'll feed the horse.\n# ''hojoth \u010dt\u028cm t\u028cms qa\u026b\u028cm''<br/>We'll finish the job.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cm\u010d\u028cps\u028cm \u028ck\u02b7 qa\u0294\u028cya''<br/>You'll dig the well\n# ''yaqa\u0161s\u028cm   t\u028c  c\u026axc\u026ak''<br/>He'll use the wagon.\n\nHarris continues by stating that if the future morpheme occurs after [\u010d], the [\u010d] becomes [c] and the [s] is dropped (73).\n\n{{ordered list|start=5\n| ''mat' at\u02b0c\u028cm t\u028c \u03bb'\u028cms''<br/>I'll paint the house.\n}}\n\n====Past====\n\nThe underlying form of the past tense is marked by the morpheme, ''\u0294o\u026b'', with surface forms including that mentioned and ''o\u026b'', the latter occurring after consonants (73). The following list shows the past tense in its various phonological environments:\n\n# ''k\u02b7a\u010dx\u02b7i y\u028cqto\u026b''<br/>Have you bought that?\n# ''k\u02b7a\u010dx\u02b7 k\u028cmgyx\u02b7o\u026b''<br/>Did you meet him?\n# ''kyakya\u010do\u026b\u010d\u028ct\u02b0''<br/>We were playing cards.\n# ''x\u028cyp\u028cnomso\u026b\u010dax\u02b7''<br/>You startled me.\n# ''xanase\u0294o\u026b\u010d \u0294\u026a\u0161\u026ams \u010d'a\u0294\u028cnu\u0294''<br/>I gave you our dog.\n# ''so\u0294o\u026b\u010d \u028ck\u02b7\u02b0  \u0294ahk\u02b7t\u02b0''<br/>I went downstream.\n# ''tih\u0294o\u026b\u010dx\u02b7''<br/>You were big.\n\n====Present====\n\nHarris concludes his treatment of tense by stating, \"the present in Comox is the unmarked tense although it is not clear that every unmarked predicate has the force of the present as an explicit factor of meaning\" (76).<ref name=\"Harris81\">Harris, H. R., II (1981) A grammatical sketch of Comox (Doctoral Dissertation). Available from  ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 8128776)</ref> That is, the lack of marking presents a certain amount of ambiguity as to the designation of tense.\n\n===Lexical Suffixes===\n\nLexical suffixes in Salishan languages have referential meaning.<ref name=\"Harris81\"/> That is, \"they refer to things as body parts, shapes and concrete objects, and are part of the semantic derivation of a stem\" (116). In the next two sections of examples, suffix referents to body parts and objects will be presented.\nThe English gloss for ''j\u026a\u0161\u026an'' is 'foot, leg' but the referential suffix is the truncated ''-\u0161\u026an'', which appears in the following (117):\n\n# ''q\u02b7as\u0161\u026an\u010d'' I burnt my foot\n# ''\u03bb'e\u0161\u026an''         Fast\n# ''pa\u0294a\u0161\u026an''   Crane(one-legged)\n\nA truncated ''-\u026ba\u026b'' similarly assumes the role of ''s\u00e1y\u026ba\u026b'' or 'neck' in the following (117):\n\n# ''q\u02b7as\u026ba\u026b\u010d'' I burnt my neck\n# ''totx\u02b7\u026ba\u026b'' Necklace\n\nLastly, here are examples of ''m\u028eqs\u026an'' ('nose') whose referential suffix, ''-\u025bq\u02b7'', bears no orthographic semblance to its root (118\u2013119):\n\n# ''\u010da\u0294\u028cje\u028cm\u025bq\u02b7''  to have an itchy nose\n# ''\u03bb\u028csse\u028cq\u02b7s\u026ac\u028cm'' I'm going to hit you on the nose\n# ''tihh\u025bq\u02b7''          big nose\n\nIn the case of object reference, some lexical suffixes have the single affix form, though many also derive from a root. The former is the case for identification of containers with the suffix ''-ayi'' (119):\n\n# ''lamayi'' bottle (liquor(rum)-container)\n# ''jamayi''  jar (jam-container)\n\nThe object referential suffix for canoe derives from the root ''n\u028cx\u02b7\u00ed\u026b'' and surfaces as ''-\u028cg\u026a\u026b'' (120):\n\n# ''q\u028cx\u02b7\u028cq\u026a\u026b''  left side of a canoe\n# ''\u0294a\u0294\u028cjum\u028cq\u026a\u026b''  right side of a canoe\n\n==Language Status==\n\nAs of 1983, only two L1 speakers of the Island Comox were surviving, an aunt and niece, the aunt born in 1900. (Kennedy and Bouchard, 23). In a later publication, Kennedy and Bouchard (1990), stated that, whether as an L1 or L2, \"in the 1980's, Mainland Comox continued being spoken fluently by about one-third of the population and was the most viable of all Salishan languages\" (Kennedy and Bouchard, 443). Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1990) reported in the same year that the number of Island Comox speakers was one, while the mainland Sliammon maintained less than 400 (64).<ref>Kennedy, D., and Bouchard, R. (1983) Sliammon life, Sliammon lands. Vancouver: Talonbooks.</ref>\nToday, Ethnologue estimates that there are roughly 40 speakers of Catlotlq, the majority of whom are L2 speakers. Ethnologue also lists Catlotlq as being ranked at an 8 on the Fishman scale of language loss severity, which reads: \"most vestigial users of Xish are socially isolated old folks and Xish needs to be reassembled from their mouths and memories and taught to demographically unconcentrated adults\" (Hinton, 49).<ref>https://www.ethnologue.com/languages/coo{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Hinton, L.

More specifically, \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m was traditionally spoken in Bute Inlet (also known as Church House), in Squirrel Cove (also known as Cortez Island), and in Sliammon, located in the area now known as Powell River.\n\nIt has two main dialects, Island Comox, associated with the [[K'omoks First Nation]], and Mainland Comox. Whereas there Comox speaks (Vancouver Island) Island dialect,  the [[Sliammon First Nation|Sliammon]], [[Klahoose First Nation|Klahoose]], and Homalco peoples speak \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m, which is referred to by some as \"Mainland Comox dialect\". As of 2012, the Island Comox dialect has no remaining speakers.<ref name=e21/> The term {{lang|kwk|comox}} is not a Comox word, but rather a Kwak'wala term meaning \"plenty\", \"abundance\", or \"wealth\u201d. So Comox is not an \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m term, but is Wakashan based.  \n\u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m means \u201cthe language of our people\u201d in Sliammon, Klahoose, and Homalco languages. \nEfforts to revitalize, rejuvenate, and revive \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m. In Powell River, Campbell River, and Cortez island have  started projects to help save  \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m. Children in daycare, preschool are being taught  \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m in schools on [[Cortez Island]], [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] (the current city where many of the Homalco people have resettled) and is now being taught in school district #47 ([[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]]). \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m is also being accepted as a second language that fulfills graduation requirements. In Powell River, \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m is taught from daycare through grade 12.\n\nA community accord was signed in 2003 between Sliammon First Nation and the municipality of Powell River. The municipality of Powell River has started to place the traditional Sliammon names in addition to the settler names on signs found throughout the district.\n\nA Sliammon [[iPhone]] app was released in March 2012. An online dictionary, phrasebook, and language learning portal is available at [[First Voices]]. In addition to the First Voices site, there are \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m dictionaries from Sliammon and Homalco, CD's containing  \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m and children's books containing The \u0294ayaju\u03b8\u0259m language are available throughout [[Powell River, British Columbia|Powell River]], [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]], and [[Cortez Island]].\n\nMany Sliammon, Klahoose and Homalco do not identify as Comox, and Comox is seen by many separate and more closely linked to the kwakwaka'wakw people as Comox people speak this language.

Words often include lexical suffixes referring to concrete physical objects or abstract extensions from them.\"<ref>Smithsonian Institution handbook of North American Indians, Vol. 7 Northwest Coast, pp.33</ref>\n\nComox has essentially lost all derivational prefixes. It is the only language in the Salish family to have lost the nominalizing prefix ''s-'' from its morphological inventory (Kroeber 11).<ref name=\"kroeber\"/>\nHowever, the morphologically mirrored ''-s'' interestingly serves as a marker for 3rd person possession (Kroeber 111). Hag\u00e8ge has found certain cases where both the prefixive ''s-'' and the suffixive ''-s'' occur in circumspection. Kroeber is wary to support the finding, but offers the following: \"This would appear to be a complex of the nominalizing prefix ''s-'' and the third person possessive ''-s''; that is, the third person form of the sort of nominalized construction widely used for subordination in Salish.\"(Kroeber 115).\n\nIn his review of Hag\u00e8ge's grammar of the language,<ref>[[Claude Hag\u00e8ge|Hag\u00e8ge, Claude]].

Kroeber states, \"After diminutive CV reduplication, all CVC roots lose their vowel, regardless of what the vowel is.\" (109) Kroeber gives the following example: ''wot'-o-t'' 'bend it', ''wo-wt'-o-t'' 'bend it a little bit' (109).\n\nThe affixes representing possession in Comox are much different than those of their Salishan counterparts. 1st person singular (''\u00e7-'') and plural (''ms-'') and 2nd person singular (''\u03b8-'') appear as prefixes, while 2nd person plural (''-ap'') and 3rd person (''-s'') appear as suffixes (Kroeber 111).<ref>International Journal of American Linguistics Vol. 55 No. 1 Jan. 1989.</ref>\n\n==Grammatical categories==\n\n===Number===\n\n\"Reduplicated counting forms with explicit reference to 'people' can be found in a large number of different Salish languages. All the basic formal shapes of reduplication in Salish (CVC-, CV-, and \u2013VC) may be used to create the 'people' counting forms.\" (412).<ref>International Journal of American Linguistics , Vol. 65, No. 4 (Oct., 1999) , pp. 412\u2013420</ref>\n\nComox numbers for 'people':\n* 1 \u2013 ''p\u00e1\u0294a''\n* 2 \u2013 ''s\u00e1\u0294a''\n* 3 \u2013 ''\u010d\u00e1las''\n* 4 \u2013 ''mus''\n* 5 \u2013 ''s\u00edya\u010dix''\n* 6 \u2013 ''t'\u00e1xam''\n* 7 \u2013 ''c'o\u0294\u010dis''\n* 8 \u2013 ''t\u00e1\u0294\u010dis''\n* 9 \u2013 ''t\u00edgyixw''\n* 10 \u2013 ''\u00fapan''\n\nComox uses CV reduplication to mark its 'people' counting forms (419\u2013420).\n* ''p\u00ed-pa\u0294a'' ('1 person')\n* ''s\u00ed-sa\u0294a'' ('2 people')\n\n===Control===\n\n\"Control [volitional] may be seen as marking the subject of the verb as a prototypical agent: the subject wants the event to occur and has the capabilities that would normally ensure that (s)he could bring about the desired event. Noncontrol [nonvolitional] signals that the subject departs in some way from prototypical agentivity; the event occurs accidentally or is something that the subject did only with difficulty\" (Kroeber 155\u2013156).\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| t\u02bcu\u00e7\u02bc-ut-as\n|-\n| shoot-CTr-3Sb\n|}\n|-\n| 'he shot it (on purpose), tried to shoot it'\n|}\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| t\u02bcu\u00e7\u02bc-\u0259x\u02b7-as\n|-\n|shoot-NTr-3Sb\n|}\n|-\n| 'he shot it (accidentally), managed to shoot it'\n|}\n\nThe inceptive reduplication of Comox is closely tied to the marking of control. In words like ''tih'' 'big', -VC reduplicates to create the inceptive form ''tih-ih'' 'get big'.  Control is then marked by further affixation: \"The CTr suffix regularly has the form ''-at'' after \u2013VC\" (Kroeber 159).\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| x\u02b7ah-at-u\u026b || \u010d || tih-ih-at-as\n|-\n| tell-CTr-Past || 1sSb || big-VC-CTr-3Sb\n|}\n|-\n| 'I told him to make it big'\n|}\n\n===Duratives===\n\n\"The durative is used for activities carried out over an extended period or habitually, such as a means of employment\" (Mithun 168). Thus, duratives demonstrate intervallic aspect. Here is an example of a durative in Comox:\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| x\u02b7ux\u02b7-mut || \u0294u\u026bq\u02b7u\n|-\n| long.time-very || dig.clams\n|}\n|-\n| 'he dug clams for a long time'\n|}\n\n===Inceptive===\n\n\"An inceptive prefix can mark the gradual, beginning stages of an event or state\" (Mithun 169).<ref>International Journal of American Linguistics , Vol. 54, No. 2 (Apr., 1988) , pp. 141\u2013167</ref>  In Comox, this is largely achieved through \u2013VC reduplication. The following example illustrates this process:\n\n* ''p\u0259s-\u0259s'' 'get numb' (''p\u0259s'' 'numb')\n* ''tih-ih'' 'get big' (''tih'' 'big')\n\n===Syntax===\n\nAs is the case for all Salish languages, Comox is predicate-initial. Czaykowski-Higgins and Kinkade (1998) state, \"VSO (verb-subject-object) is most commonly said to be the preferred word order in most Salish languages, with postpredicate word order nevertheless being fairly free\" (37). Kroeber (1999) confirms this information and expounds upon it by stating, \"in all Salish languages, the predicate is most often clause-initial, followed by nominal expressions and prepositional phrases coding participants in the event\" (37). He further notes that prepositional phrases generally represent obliques, leaving subjects and objects unmarked (38).<ref name=\"kroeber\"/><ref>Czaykowski-Higgins, E., and Kinkade, M. D. (1998) Salish languages and linguistics: Theoretical and descriptive perspectives. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter.</ref>\n\n===Word Classification===\n\nIn addition to the loss of derivational prefixes, Comox has also lost the nominalizer prefix in many of its uses. Further, there is extant ambiguity as to the ability \u2013 or need \u2013 to classify certain words as 'noun' or 'verb' within the Salish family. An example of the uncertainty is the word ''\u0294i\u026ct\u0259n'', which can appear as both a noun and a verb, and is identified through the results of its affixation. Kroeber (1999) provides the following example:\n\nverb:\n\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| \u0294i\u026ct\u0259n || \u0294i\u026ct\u0259n\u203f\u010dx\u02b7\n|-\n| 'eat' || 'you eat'\n|}\n\nnoun:\n\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| \u0294i\u026ct\u0259n || t\u0259\u203f\u0294i\u026ct\u0259n-s\n|-\n| 'food' || 'his/her food'\n|}\n\nThe word ''\u0294i\u026ct\u0259n'' in these examples is semantically similar though grammatically contrasted. The suffixation present in the first instance marks the word as a verb and also indicates person, in this case the second. The prefix and suffix in the latter instance nominalize the word, possession designated as seen earlier by the suffix ''-s'' (34\u201335).<ref name=\"kroeber\">Kroeber, P. D.

Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.</ref>\n\n===Complements of Negative Predicates===\n\nIn Coast Salish languages, all but Squamish feature subject-predicate mirroring \u2013 a sort of clausal concord \u2013 in person and number. To illustrate this point, here are examples from Catlotlq and Squamish:\n\nCatlotlq \u2013\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| x\u02b7a\u0294\u203f\u010d || q\u0259jiy-an || p'ap'im\n|-\n| not\u203f1s.SU.CL || still-1s.CJ.SU || work\n|}\n|-\n| 'I'm not still working'\n|}\n\nSquamish \u2013\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| h\u00e1w || q\u203f\u0294an\u203fc'ic'\u00e1p || ti\u203fsc\u00ed\u0294s\n|-\n| not || IRR\u203f1s.CJ.SU\u203fwork || ART\u203ftoday\n|}\n|-\n| 'I do not work today'\n|}\n\nIn the Catlotlq example, the negating predicate assumes the same person and number as the subject. Conversely, the Squamish negating predicate remains unmarked. The difference between Squamish and Coast Salish languages in this case, is the irrealis marker ''q-'' on the subject, a common feature of non-Salish languages.<ref name=\"kroeber\"/>\n\n===Oblique===\n\nLike its fellow Coast Salish languages, Catlotlq utilizes a single preposition, ''\u0294\u0259'', to mark the oblique (Kroeber, 45). Below are two examples:\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| p\u0259q\u02b7s-a-t-as || \u0294\u0259\u203ft\u0259\u203fqa\u0294ya\n|-\n| enter.water-LV-TR-3.TR.SU || OBL\u203fART\u203fwater\n|}\n|-\n| 'He dropped it in the water'\n|}\n\n{|\n|\n{|\n|- style=\"font-style:italic;\"\n| hu\u203f\u0161t\u203f\u0259m || xapj-a-mi || (\u0294\u0259)\u203fk\u02b7\u0259\u203f\u03b8\u203ftuwa\n|-\n| go\u203f1p.SU.CL\u203fFUT || return-TR-2s.OB || OBL\u203fART\u203f2s.PO\u203fbe.from\n|}\n|-\n| 'We will send you back to where you came from'\n|}\n\nInterestingly, the oblique marker in these examples also serves a locative purpose, identifying where the object was dropped and the individual's original orientation. The subjects and objects in both phrases are, true to form, unmarked by preposition.\n\n===Transitivity===\n\nTransitivity in Catlotlq has several suffix paradigms. With respect to one of these paradigms, Harris states, \"object suffixes preced[ing] subject suffixes\" (50). He offers first a list of object pronouns as they appear with transitive roots and then gives examples of each of them in their respective environments.\n\nThe objective pronouns on transitive roots are:\n\n{|\n| ''-s-'' || me || ''-tulmo\u026b-'' || us\n|-\n| ''-s\u026a-'' || you(sg.) || ''-tanapi-'' || you(pl.)\n|-\n| ''-t-'' || him, her, it || ''-t(\u028cw?)-'' || them\n|}\n\nApplied to the root 'called':\n\n# ''y\u00e1\u026bas\u028cs''  He called me.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026bas\u026as''  He called you.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026bat\u02b0\u010dan''  I called him.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026batulmo\u026b\u028cs'' He called us.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026batanap\u026as''  He called you.\n# ''y\u00e1\u026batew\u0294\u010dan''  I called them.\n\nIn relation to transitivity, Catlotlq also demonstrates the benefactive suffix with the suffix ''\u0294\u028cm'' (Harris, 52). Following the objective pronouns given in the previous example, the next set of data (Harris, 53) illustrates the benefactive suffix:\n\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmsas''  He dug it for me.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cms\u026as''  He dug it for you.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtas''  He dug it for him.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtulmo\u026bas'' He dug it for us.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtanap\u026as'' He dug it for you (pl.).\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cmtasew\u0294'' He dug it for them.\n\nMithun (1999) explains: \"A benefactive applicative allows beneficiaries to be cast as direct objects\" (247). Thus, the transitivity not only denotes direction, but a benefactor and the recipient.\n\n===Tense===\n\n====Future====\n\nHarris (1981) states, \"there are three explicit tenses in Comox: the past, the present, and the future\" (72). He first looks at the future tense marked by the morpheme ''-s\u028cm'', noting that \"if the preceding pronoun ends in a [t] the [s] is dropped\" (73).\n\n# ''tahath\u010dxws\u028cm t\u028c kyut\u028cn''<br/>You'll feed the horse.\n# ''hojoth \u010dt\u028cm t\u028cms qa\u026b\u028cm''<br/>We'll finish the job.\n# ''s\u026aq\u0294\u028cm\u010d\u028cps\u028cm \u028ck\u02b7 qa\u0294\u028cya''<br/>You'll dig the well\n# ''yaqa\u0161s\u028cm   t\u028c  c\u026axc\u026ak''<br/>He'll use the wagon.\n\nHarris continues by stating that if the future morpheme occurs after [\u010d], the [\u010d] becomes [c] and the [s] is dropped (73).\n\n{{ordered list|start=5\n| ''mat' at\u02b0c\u028cm t\u028c \u03bb'\u028cms''<br/>I'll paint the house.\n}}\n\n====Past====\n\nThe underlying form of the past tense is marked by the morpheme, ''\u0294o\u026b'', with surface forms including that mentioned and ''o\u026b'', the latter occurring after consonants (73). The following list shows the past tense in its various phonological environments:\n\n# ''k\u02b7a\u010dx\u02b7i y\u028cqto\u026b''<br/>Have you bought that?\n# ''k\u02b7a\u010dx\u02b7 k\u028cmgyx\u02b7o\u026b''<br/>Did you meet him?\n# ''kyakya\u010do\u026b\u010d\u028ct\u02b0''<br/>We were playing cards.\n# ''x\u028cyp\u028cnomso\u026b\u010dax\u02b7''<br/>You startled me.\n# ''xanase\u0294o\u026b\u010d \u0294\u026a\u0161\u026ams \u010d'a\u0294\u028cnu\u0294''<br/>I gave you our dog.\n# ''so\u0294o\u026b\u010d \u028ck\u02b7\u02b0  \u0294ahk\u02b7t\u02b0''<br/>I went downstream.\n# ''tih\u0294o\u026b\u010dx\u02b7''<br/>You were big.\n\n====Present====\n\nHarris concludes his treatment of tense by stating, \"the present in Comox is the unmarked tense although it is not clear that every unmarked predicate has the force of the present as an explicit factor of meaning\" (76).<ref name=\"Harris81\">Harris, H. R., II (1981) A grammatical sketch of Comox (Doctoral Dissertation). Available from  ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 8128776)</ref> That is, the lack of marking presents a certain amount of ambiguity as to the designation of tense.\n\n===Lexical Suffixes===\n\nLexical suffixes in Salishan languages have referential meaning.<ref name=\"Harris81\"/> That is, \"they refer to things as body parts, shapes and concrete objects, and are part of the semantic derivation of a stem\" (116). In the next two sections of examples, suffix referents to body parts and objects will be presented.\nThe English gloss for ''j\u026a\u0161\u026an'' is 'foot, leg' but the referential suffix is the truncated ''-\u0161\u026an'', which appears in the following (117):\n\n# ''q\u02b7as\u0161\u026an\u010d'' I burnt my foot\n# ''\u03bb'e\u0161\u026an''         Fast\n# ''pa\u0294a\u0161\u026an''   Crane(one-legged)\n\nA truncated ''-\u026ba\u026b'' similarly assumes the role of ''s\u00e1y\u026ba\u026b'' or 'neck' in the following (117):\n\n# ''q\u02b7as\u026ba\u026b\u010d'' I burnt my neck\n# ''totx\u02b7\u026ba\u026b'' Necklace\n\nLastly, here are examples of ''m\u028eqs\u026an'' ('nose') whose referential suffix, ''-\u025bq\u02b7'', bears no orthographic semblance to its root (118\u2013119):\n\n# ''\u010da\u0294\u028cje\u028cm\u025bq\u02b7''  to have an itchy nose\n# ''\u03bb\u028csse\u028cq\u02b7s\u026ac\u028cm'' I'm going to hit you on the nose\n# ''tihh\u025bq\u02b7''          big nose\n\nIn the case of object reference, some lexical suffixes have the single affix form, though many also derive from a root. The former is the case for identification of containers with the suffix ''-ayi'' (119):\n\n# ''lamayi'' bottle (liquor(rum)-container)\n# ''jamayi''  jar (jam-container)\n\nThe object referential suffix for canoe derives from the root ''n\u028cx\u02b7\u00ed\u026b'' and surfaces as ''-\u028cg\u026a\u026b'' (120):\n\n# ''q\u028cx\u02b7\u028cq\u026a\u026b''  left side of a canoe\n# ''\u0294a\u0294\u028cjum\u028cq\u026a\u026b''  right side of a canoe\n\n==Language Status==\n\nAs of 1983, only two L1 speakers of the Island Comox were surviving, an aunt and niece, the aunt born in 1900. (Kennedy and Bouchard, 23). In a later publication, Kennedy and Bouchard (1990), stated that, whether as an L1 or L2, \"in the 1980's, Mainland Comox continued being spoken fluently by about one-third of the population and was the most viable of all Salishan languages\" (Kennedy and Bouchard, 443). Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1990) reported in the same year that the number of Island Comox speakers was one, while the mainland Sliammon maintained less than 400 (64).<ref>Kennedy, D., and Bouchard, R. (1983) Sliammon life, Sliammon lands. Vancouver: Talonbooks.</ref>\nToday, Ethnologue estimates that there are roughly 40 speakers of Catlotlq, the majority of whom are L2 speakers. Ethnologue also lists Catlotlq as being ranked at an 8 on the Fishman scale of language loss severity, which reads: \"most vestigial users of Xish are socially isolated old folks and Xish needs to be reassembled from their mouths and memories and taught to demographically unconcentrated adults\" (Hinton, 49).<ref>https://www.ethnologue.com/languages/coo{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Hinton, L.

Quezon City was then the capital of the Philippines, and embassies were to be put up on the stretch of highway. Because the country's capital was moved back to [[Manila]] in 1976, other establishments were put up instead. The Don Mariano Marcos Avenue was later extended from the Elliptical Road to Calle Espana (now known as [[Espana Boulevard]]). The Don Mariano Marcos Avenue was later renamed into two parts, the Commonwealth Avenue and [[Quezon Avenue]]. Later Commonwealth Avenue regained the 8-lane Fairview Avenue, which ends in the Jordan Plains Subdivision in Novaliches.\n\nIn the 1980s, the road was widened into a six-lane highway. During the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the avenue was prone to heavy traffic and accidents due to the increase in number of public transportation vehicles plying the highway, and sidewalk vendors crowding onto the road. In the late 2000s (decade), the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] cleared the sidewalk vendors, especially in the Tandang Sora area, which was prone to heavy rush hour traffic. Fairview Avenue uses stoplights and center island splittings in its intersections, while the Don Mariano Marcos Avenue uses interchanges in its intersections.\n\nThe avenue is 18 lanes at its widest, and is the widest road in the Philippines, beating the old record set by [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]].<ref>[http://doycinco.blogspot.com/2008/05/commonwealth-av-ang-killer-highway.html Commonwealth Avenue, the Killer Highway]{{in lang|tl}}{{self-published source|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Linking to Quirino Highway===\nOn October 1, 2009, Quezon City Mayor [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] announced his 15-year-old plan to link Commonwealth Avenue and Quirino Highway at the cost of P20 million to P140 million, which would be adjacent to Zabarte Road.<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/222742/p6589m-c7-extension-be-constructed-october-15 Manila Bulletin Online]</ref> The project was completed in May 2011 and is already operational.{{When|date=June 2015}}\n\n===60 km/h speed limit implementation===\nFrom May 2011, a {{convert|60|km/h|mph|sp=us}} speed limit is enforced on Commonwealth Avenue, following the death of [[Chit Estella|Lourdes Estella-Simbulan]], a journalist, on a road accident in the avenue.

The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] is the largest entirely indigenous Christian religious organization that originated from the [[Philippines]] and the largest independent church in [[Asia]]. Aside from the Central Temple, two large chapels of the INC are also located in Commonwealth Avenue (Commonwealth and Capitol).\n\n===The Sandiganbayan===\n{{main|Sandiganbayan}}\nThe [[Sandiganbayan]] is a special court in the Philippines which was established under Presidential Decree No. 1606. Its rank is equivalent to the Court of Appeals. The court consists of 14 Associate Justices and 1 Presiding Justice. The Sandiganbayan building is located at Centennial Building, Commonwealth Avenue cor. Batasan Road, [[Quezon City]]. The trials of former president [[Joseph Estrada]] were held there from 2001 to 2007.\n\n===New Era University===\n{{main|New Era University}}\n[[New Era University]] (NEU) is an educational institution in the Philippines, run by the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (INC). This university is one of the largest non-Catholic universities in the Philippines with approximately 30,000 students. Its main campus is in # 9 Central Avenue, New Era, Quezon City, in the Central Office Complex of the [[Iglesia Ni Cristo]]. It has several branches around the Philippines, including one in San Fernando City, Pampanga, in Lipa City, Batangas and in General Santos City, South Cotabato.\n\n===University of the Philippines Diliman===\n[[File:UP Diliman Quezon Hall.jpg|thumbnail|[[University of the Philippines Diliman]]]]\n{{main|University of the Philippines Diliman}}\nThe [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], or U.P.

It offers courses in Liberal Arts, Social Sciences, Law, Business and Economics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Music and Fine Arts among others. It offers the largest number of graduate and undergraduate courses among all the universities in the Philippines. In 2007, construction started on a 37.5-hectare technology park being developed by the [[Ayala Corporation]] inside the campus of the university near the avenue.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/117183/New-Ayala-technology-park-ready-to-welcome-tenants New Ayala technology park ready to welcome tenants] GMANews.tv</ref> The [[U.P.-Ayala Land TechnoHub]] now hosts multinational corporations such as [[Convergys]], [[IBM]], [[HSBC]], and [[Manulife]].\n\n===Quezon Memorial Circle===\n[[File:Elliptical Road, QMC monument tower, PTV-4 transmitter (Diliman, Quezon City)(2018-02-07).jpg|thumbnail|Quezon Memorial Circle]]\n{{main|Quezon Memorial Circle}}\nThe [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] is a national park and shrine located in [[Quezon City]], former capital of the Philippines (1948\u20131976). The park is an ellipse bounded by the Elliptical Road. The site was originally intended as the grounds of the National Capitol to be built in Quezon City. While the cornerstone for the structure was laid in 1940, only the foundations were in place when construction was interrupted by the beginning of the [[Second World War]] in the Philippines. After [[World War II]], President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] issued an executive order stipulating the creation of a Quezon Memorial Committee to raise funds by public subscription to erect a monument to his predecessor, President [[Manuel L. Quezon|Manuel Luis Quezon]]. The height of monument stands at 66 meters, the same number as the age when Quezon died in 1944.\n\n===Shopping centers===\nThere are a few shopping centers along the avenue. The first mall to open along the avenue is Ever Gotesco Commonwealth which services people along the Commonwealth, Diliman and Batasan areas. There are also two malls serving the Tandang Sora area: Puregold Tandang Sora on the southbound lane and Berkeley Square on the northbound lane. The [[U.P.\u2013Ayala Land TechnoHub]] hosts amusement centers and restaurants, while a smaller mall, the Citimall, serves the Philcoa area near the University of the Philippines Diliman campus and caters mostly to commuters. Fairview Center Mall caters the Fairview area, while [[SM City Fairview]] and [[Robinsons Novaliches]] are in close proximity of the Jordan Plains terminus of the avenue. Last to be completed is Shopwise Commonwealth near Ever Gotesco. Puregold North Commonwealth was opened on the former site of the Fairview Wet & Dry Market. A Puregold Jr. branch was also opened beside the [[Diliman Preparatory School]] campus. A [[Convergys Corporation|Convergys]] building along the Batasan area also hosts commercial centers.\n\n===Other buildings and structures===\n[[File:Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City near PhilCoA.jpg|thumbnail|Commonwealth Avenue near [[Philippine Coconut Authority]].]]\nThere are many schools located along the avenue: the [[National College of Business and Arts]] in Fairview,<ref>[http://www.ncba.edu.ph National College of Business and Arts]</ref> Our Lady of Mercy School, [[Diliman Preparatory School]],<ref>[http://www.dps.edu.ph Diliman Preparatory School]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216105050/http://www.dps.edu.ph/ |date=February 16, 2013 }}</ref> and Lux Domine Academy which are located in the Batasan area. Also, car companies like [[Toyota]], [[Kia Motors]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Suzuki]] and [[Nissan]] have distributions in the avenue.

Quezon City was then the capital of the Philippines, and embassies were to be put up on the stretch of highway. Because the country's capital was moved back to [[Manila]] in 1976, other establishments were put up instead. The Don Mariano Marcos Avenue was later extended from the Elliptical Road to Calle Espana (now known as [[Espana Boulevard]]). The Don Mariano Marcos Avenue was later renamed into two parts, the Commonwealth Avenue and [[Quezon Avenue]]. Later Commonwealth Avenue regained the 8-lane Fairview Avenue, which ends in the Jordan Plains Subdivision in Novaliches.\n\nIn the 1980s, the road was widened into a six-lane highway. During the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the avenue was prone to heavy traffic and accidents due to the increase in number of public transportation vehicles plying the highway, and sidewalk vendors crowding onto the road. In the late 2000s (decade), the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] cleared the sidewalk vendors, especially in the Tandang Sora area, which was prone to heavy rush hour traffic. Fairview Avenue uses stoplights and center island splittings in its intersections, while the Don Mariano Marcos Avenue uses interchanges in its intersections.\n\nThe avenue is 18 lanes at its widest, and is the widest road in the Philippines, beating the old record set by [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]].<ref>[http://doycinco.blogspot.com/2008/05/commonwealth-av-ang-killer-highway.html Commonwealth Avenue, the Killer Highway]{{in lang|tl}}{{self-published source|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Linking to Quirino Highway===\nOn October 1, 2009, Quezon City Mayor [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] announced his 15-year-old plan to link Commonwealth Avenue and Quirino Highway at the cost of P20 million to P140 million, which would be adjacent to Zabarte Road.<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/222742/p6589m-c7-extension-be-constructed-october-15 Manila Bulletin Online]</ref> The project was completed in May 2011 and is already operational.{{When|date=June 2015}}\n\n===60 km/h speed limit implementation===\nFrom May 2011, a {{convert|60|km/h|mph|sp=us}} speed limit is enforced on Commonwealth Avenue, following the death of [[Chit Estella|Lourdes Estella-Simbulan]], a journalist, on a road accident in the avenue.

The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] is the largest entirely indigenous Christian religious organization that originated from the [[Philippines]] and the largest independent church in [[Asia]]. Aside from the Central Temple, two large chapels of the INC are also located in Commonwealth Avenue (Commonwealth and Capitol).\n\n===The Sandiganbayan===\n{{main|Sandiganbayan}}\nThe [[Sandiganbayan]] is a special court in the Philippines which was established under Presidential Decree No. 1606. Its rank is equivalent to the Court of Appeals. The court consists of 14 Associate Justices and 1 Presiding Justice. The Sandiganbayan building is located at Centennial Building, Commonwealth Avenue cor. Batasan Road, [[Quezon City]]. The trials of former president [[Joseph Estrada]] were held there from 2001 to 2007.\n\n===New Era University===\n{{main|New Era University}}\n[[New Era University]] (NEU) is an educational institution in the Philippines, run by the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (INC). This university is one of the largest non-Catholic universities in the Philippines with approximately 30,000 students. Its main campus is in # 9 Central Avenue, New Era, Quezon City, in the Central Office Complex of the [[Iglesia Ni Cristo]]. It has several branches around the Philippines, including one in San Fernando City, Pampanga, in Lipa City, Batangas and in General Santos City, South Cotabato.\n\n===University of the Philippines Diliman===\n[[File:UP Diliman Quezon Hall.jpg|thumbnail|[[University of the Philippines Diliman]]]]\n{{main|University of the Philippines Diliman}}\nThe [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], or U.P. Diliman, is the flagship campus of the [[University of the Philippines]]. It is located in Diliman, [[Quezon City]]. It offers courses in Liberal Arts, Social Sciences, Law, Business and Economics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Music and Fine Arts among others. It offers the largest number of graduate and undergraduate courses among all the universities in the Philippines. In 2007, construction started on a 37.5-hectare technology park being developed by the [[Ayala Corporation]] inside the campus of the university near the avenue.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/117183/New-Ayala-technology-park-ready-to-welcome-tenants New Ayala technology park ready to welcome tenants] GMANews.tv</ref> The [[U.P.-Ayala Land TechnoHub]] now hosts multinational corporations such as [[Convergys]], [[IBM]], [[HSBC]], and [[Manulife]].\n\n===Quezon Memorial Circle===\n[[File:Elliptical Road, QMC monument tower, PTV-4 transmitter (Diliman, Quezon City)(2018-02-07).jpg|thumbnail|Quezon Memorial Circle]]\n{{main|Quezon Memorial Circle}}\nThe [[Quezon Memorial Circle]] is a national park and shrine located in [[Quezon City]], former capital of the Philippines (1948\u20131976). The park is an ellipse bounded by the Elliptical Road. The site was originally intended as the grounds of the National Capitol to be built in Quezon City. While the cornerstone for the structure was laid in 1940, only the foundations were in place when construction was interrupted by the beginning of the [[Second World War]] in the Philippines. After [[World War II]], President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] issued an executive order stipulating the creation of a Quezon Memorial Committee to raise funds by public subscription to erect a monument to his predecessor, President [[Manuel L. Quezon|Manuel Luis Quezon]]. The height of monument stands at 66 meters, the same number as the age when Quezon died in 1944.\n\n===Shopping centers===\nThere are a few shopping centers along the avenue. The first mall to open along the avenue is Ever Gotesco Commonwealth which services people along the Commonwealth, Diliman and Batasan areas. There are also two malls serving the Tandang Sora area: Puregold Tandang Sora on the southbound lane and Berkeley Square on the northbound lane. The [[U.P.\u2013Ayala Land TechnoHub]] hosts amusement centers and restaurants, while a smaller mall, the Citimall, serves the Philcoa area near the University of the Philippines Diliman campus and caters mostly to commuters. Fairview Center Mall caters the Fairview area, while [[SM City Fairview]] and [[Robinsons Novaliches]] are in close proximity of the Jordan Plains terminus of the avenue. Last to be completed is Shopwise Commonwealth near Ever Gotesco. Puregold North Commonwealth was opened on the former site of the Fairview Wet & Dry Market. A Puregold Jr. branch was also opened beside the [[Diliman Preparatory School]] campus. A [[Convergys Corporation|Convergys]] building along the Batasan area also hosts commercial centers.\n\n===Other buildings and structures===\n[[File:Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City near PhilCoA.jpg|thumbnail|Commonwealth Avenue near [[Philippine Coconut Authority]].]]\nThere are many schools located along the avenue: the [[National College of Business and Arts]] in Fairview,<ref>[http://www.ncba.edu.ph National College of Business and Arts]</ref> Our Lady of Mercy School, [[Diliman Preparatory School]],<ref>[http://www.dps.edu.ph Diliman Preparatory School]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216105050/http://www.dps.edu.ph/ |date=February 16, 2013 }}</ref> and Lux Domine Academy which are located in the Batasan area. Also, car companies like [[Toyota]], [[Kia Motors]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Suzuki]] and [[Nissan]] have distributions in the avenue.

Palendrano]]''), while others have chosen to continue to recognize them. In some states, the elements of many crimes are defined mostly or entirely by common law, i.e., by prior judicial decisions. For instance, [[Michigan]]'s penal code does not define the crime of [[murder]]: while the penalties for murder are laid out in statute, the actual elements of murder, and their meaning, is entirely set out in case law.<ref>{{cite court |litigants= People v.
