Originally created in 1994 for ''[[The Batman Adventures|The Batman Adventures Annual]]'' #1, a series published by [[DC Comics]], based on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Roxy was incorporated into ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' in the episode \"The Ultimate Thrill\", which first aired on September 14, 1998. Shortly thereafter, Roxy appeared in \"Knight Time\", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Roxy later appeared in several comic books based on the TV show. In 2006, the character was introduced to the main [[DC Universe]].\n\n==Appearance==\nRoxy wears a black tank top under a brown pilot's jacket. She wears what seem to be black [[leggings]] and a [[visor]]. She has a holster for a ray gun.\n\nShe is a busty, tall and slender woman with red hair and black lipstick.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===DC Animated Universe===\nRoxy Rocket was first seen in the projects in the DC Animated Universe voiced by [[Charity James]].\n\nIn her appearance on ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Roxanne \"Roxy Rocket\" Sutton was formerly a [[stunt double]] for a Hollywood actress. However, she lost her job after she tried to make her stunts too dangerous for any company to insure her. Out of work, but still hungering for thrills, Sutton began stealing jewels for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], while slightly seducing him. Unlike other villains in [[Gotham City]], Roxy's crimes were fairly benign. She was always the one being put at risk. [[Batman]] also took risks in his attempts to catch Roxy in midair chases, leading Roxy to believe Batman was a kindred spirit who understood the pleasure of risk-taking. In the end, however, Roxy realized her feelings were unrequited when Batman had her arrested as the police approach the area. When she asked what this was, Batman quoted \"My game and you lost.\"\n\nRoxy next appeared in \"Knight Time\", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. In what amounts to a [[cameo appearance]], Roxy tries her luck in Metropolis where she ends up tipping off Superman to the fact that Batman is conspicuously absent in Gotham. Unlike Batman (who cannot fly), Superman picks Roxy off her rocket speeder with no effort at all. The episode eventually leads to a team-up between [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and Superman.\n\nRoxy Rocket appears in ''The Batman Adventures Annual'' #1 where she vows to \"straighten up and fly right\". However she is seen robbing a safe on a security camera, but it turns out she was framed by [[Catwoman]]. Angered at this, she tries, along with Batman, to apprehend her which results in a fight between the two women. Catwoman tries to hold her hostage with the intent of killing her but Roxy manages to get away and knocks her off the rooftop with a punch. Roxy makes the effort to save her but Catwoman slashes her hand instead choosing to fall down into the alleyway below. Roxy expresses worry and extreme remorse thinking that she has killed her but Batman reassures her that Catwoman still has \"eight more lives\".\n\nIn ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #6, [[Hawkgirl]] posed as Roxy Rocket.\n\nIn ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #10, Roxy Rocket made a cameo where she uses a [[jet pack|rocket pack]] instead of her usual rocket speeder.\n\n===Comics===\nRoxy Rocket makes a cameo appearance in the pages of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #822, written by Paul Dini.

They crash high on the Sprang River Bridge and it takes Batman an hour and a half to get them both down. This is her first appearance in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nAfter a lengthy absence from the DCU, Roxy made her first proper appearance in ''[[Batgirl]]'' #6-7, as one of the villains in [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette]]'s game, and is shown battling the new Batgirl, [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] in the ''[[Batgirl]]'' #7 cover.<ref>http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2009/11/bgv2-cv7.jpg</ref>\n\nRoxy appeared in ''[[Batman Black and White|Batman: Black and White]]'' #1.

{"title_page": "Quadruple track", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Cathiron WCML.jpg|thumb|Quadruple track section of the [[West Coast Main Line]], England]]\n\nA '''quadruple-track''' railway (also known as a '''four-track''' railway) is a [[railway]] line consisting of four parallel [[track (rail transport)|tracks]], with two tracks used in each direction. Quadruple-track railways can handle large amounts of traffic, and so are used on very busy routes.\n\n== Advantages ==\n* Quadruple track can manage a larger amount of traffic with usually twice the capacity of double track.  It is often seen around large [[metropolis]] or on busy inter-city corridors.\n* In quadruple track, faster trains can overtake slower ones, and quadrupling can contribute to faster operation of trains. [[High-speed rail]] of 200&nbsp;km/h average speed and [[commuter rail]] of 40&nbsp;km/h average can co-exist in quadruple track without interrupting each other.\n* It is relatively easy to do maintenance and engineering work of tracks in quadruple line with minimum effect of train delay because double-track service is kept even if the other two double tracks are halted during the work.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n* Quadruple track costs more due to requiring more materials and increased land acquisition costs. This also applies to tunneling and bridge costs.\n* When adding tracks, land acquisition can become prohibitively expensive.\n* Maintenance costs are higher and often more complex as there may be more switches (points) on the track than on a two-track line (to facilitate switching from outer to inner tracks and vice versa).\n* For safety, costly [[grade separation]]s are almost always required.\n* If needing more capacity, it can be better to add a double track along a different route, because it could improve local and regional transit much along an under-served route, and reduce land acquisition cost by choosing a less built-up area.\n\n== Operation ==\nIn quadruple track, trains are sorted in various ways in order to make maximum use of track capacity. These can include one or a combination of:\n* '''Sorting by speed'''\nA faster express line and a stopping local line are separated, with each having a separate pair of tracks.\nConstruction of new double tracks dedicated to [[high-speed rail]] alongside existing conventional double track used by regional and local passenger trains and freight trains is a form of quadruple track. It increases the capacity of that route significantly, and allows for significant increases in inter-city high-speed train frequency with reduced travel times.\n* '''Sorting by distance'''\nLong distance [[inter-city rail]] and freight trains are separated from short distance commuter rail. This helps to prevent delays on one service affecting the other, and is commonly seen in metropolitan areas. Quadrupling may be necessary when a new commuter rail service begins to operate on an existing line. Sometimes the local trains have separate technology, such as electrical system or signalling, which requires strict separation, for example in [[Berlin S-Bahn|Berlin]] or [[S-train|Copenhagen]].\n* '''Sorting by destination'''\nWhen a quadruple track line divides to different destinations part way along, trains need to be sorted by their destination.\n* '''Sorting by passenger/ freight'''\nPassenger trains and freight trains can be separated with each different track.\n\nA variation of this can be found on the quadruple track section of the [[Main Northern railway line|Main Northern line]] in [[New South Wales]] between [[Waratah railway station|Waratah]] and [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]] where one pair of tracks are used exclusively for coal trains and the other pair are used for passenger trains and general freight.  A similar process, but with all intercity and commuter passenger trains on the outer tracks and thru-freight trains on the inner tracks, was done by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] on its New York-Washington and Philadelphia-Pittsburgh mainlines prior to the takeover of operations by [[Amtrak]] and [[Conrail]] (and later [[Norfolk Southern]]).  This is somewhat still done to this day by NS, [[CSX]], and Conrail Shared Assets trains on Amtrak-owned trackage in the Philadelphia area.\n* '''Other modes'''\nTwo double track lines along opposite sides of a river can operate as a quadruple track. Examples of this can be found in [[Rhone]] in France and [[Rhine]] in Germany.\n\n== Layouts ==\nAs it can be seen from the pictures below in the Gallery of diagrams, the four tracks can be paired either by direction (slow and fast in each pair) or by purpose (speed or direction in each pair). Sometimes two of the tracks go more straight and with a little distance from the two other. This is a design decision when widening a double track section, and allows higher speed on the faster tracks.\n<gallery>\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Direction - Fast in Centre.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Direction - Platforms in Centre.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Direction - Slow in Centre.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Use.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Use SIS.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:COUNTY-Pre-Rebuild-West-Gantry.jpg|thumb|4-track section of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] in New Jersey]]\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== Belgium ====\nSeveral lines radiating from [[Brussels]] are quadrupled, for instance the [[Ghent]]-[[Ostend]] line as far as [[Essene-Lombeek]]. Further quadrupling has recently been carried out as part of the development of the [[Brussels Regional Express Network]]. The building of high-speed lines has also led to quadrupling - for instance the [[HSL 2]] high-speed line between Brussels and [[Cologne]] runs inside the local lines as far as [[Leuven]]. Meanwhile since 1934 Brussels and [[Antwerp]] have been connected by two separate pairs of double track. Fast trains normally use line [[Belgian railway line 25|25]], while line 27 serves slow trains. In places they run parallel, but at times diverge and cross over each other.\n\n==== Denmark ====\n* There are two places in Denmark with four tracks: Between [[Klampenborg]] and [[H\u00f8je Taastrup]], through [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, there are four tracks; two are for the separated [[S-train]]s and two for mainline trains; where the two tracks closest to Copenhagen (the oldest and central parts of Copenhagen) are reserved for S-trains (on much the lines this is the Northern and Western two tracks). Also between [[H\u00f8je Taastrup]] and [[Roskilde]], where the two center tracks are for InterCity, long distance commuter trains (further than [[Roskilde]] or [[Ringsted]]), while the outer two tracks are for commuter trains to/from [[Ringsted]] or [[Holb\u00e6k]]. It has been suggested that the S-trains should continue from H\u00f8je Taastrup to Roskilde, but this plan was abandoned; partly due to Roskilde refusing the offer for fear they would become a suburb of Copenhagen, and partly due to construction costs which would exceed the advantages.\n\n==== Finland ====\n* [[Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki railway]] has four tracks between [[Helsinki Central Station]] and [[Kerava railway station]]\n* [[Rantarata|Helsinki-Turku railway]] has four tracks between [[Helsinki Central Station]] and [[Lepp\u00e4vaara station]]\n\n==== Germany ====\n* The [[Berlin Stadtbahn]], Germany, has four tracks. Two are for the separated [[S-Bahn]] and two for mainline trains.\n* The 112&nbsp;km long [[Hamm\u2013Minden railway]] between [[Hamm]] and [[Minden]] in Germany is completely quadruple-track with separate tracks for freight and passenger trains.\n* The 50&nbsp;km long railway from Rastatt to Offenburg in Germany has four tracks.\n* The [[Hohenzollern Bridge]], with six tracks\n* The line from Munich to Augsburg has four tracks and near Munich even more\n\n==== Ireland ====\n[[File:Kishoge Station.jpg|thumb|Quadrupled section of the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] system]]\n* In [[Ireland]], the busiest section of railway in the country, on the approach to Dublin's [[Heuston railway station|Heuston station]] from [[Hazelhatch and Celbridge railway station|Hazelhatch & Celbridge]] was quadrupled in 2009.\n\n==== Italy ====\n* The [[Rome\u2013Naples high-speed railway]] and the Rome\u2013Sulmona\u2013Pescara railway in Italy combine to form a quadruple track section between Roma Prenestina railway station and Salone railway station.\n* The main section of [[Ferrovie Nord Milano]] line between [[Milan]] and [[Saronno]] in Italy. Outer regional trains are segregated from the inner suburban trains.\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n* The [[Amsterdam\u2013Arnhem railway]] between [[Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA railway station|Amsterdam Bijlmer]] and [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]], the Netherlands, has been quadrupled between 1999 and 2008.\n* The [[Breda\u2013Eindhoven railway]] between [[Boxtel railway station|Boxtel]] and [[Eindhoven railway station|Eindhoven]], the Netherlands, was quadrupled between 1998 and 2002.\n* The [[Breda\u2013Rotterdam railway]] between Rotterdam and Dordrecht has been quadrupled.\n\n==== Portugal ====\n\n* The sub-urban railway axis between [[Agualva-Cac\u00e9m|Mira-Sintra]] and [[Alverca do Ribatejo|Alverca]] in the [[Lisbon metropolitan area|Lisbon Metropolitan]] Area, part of the [[Linha de Sintra]], [[Linha de Cintura|Linha da Cintura]] and [[Linha do Norte]]. Portugal's busiest railway by number of passengers and trains.\n\n==== Sweden ====\n* All of the mainline railway through [[Stockholm County]] (between [[J\u00e4rna]] and Myrbacken north of [[M\u00e4rsta]], {{convert|83|km|mi|abbr=on}}) has four tracks, sometimes having two routes. There are plans to widen Stockholm\u2013[[B\u00e5lsta]] and Myrbacken\u2013[[Uppsala]] to quadruple track with parts finished or under construction. After this, the [[Stockholm commuter rail]] would have its own tracks everywhere.\n* The section between [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Arl\u00f6v]] on the [[Southern Main Line]] has four tracks. As of 2018, an extension to [[Lund]] is expected to be finished in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.trafikverket.se/lund-arlov |title=Lund\u2013Arl\u00f6v, fyra sp\u00e5r |publisher=[[Swedish Transport Administration]] |language=Swedish |access-date=19 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Switzerland ====\n* The 120&nbsp;km long railway from Z\u00fcrich to Olten contains long quadruple track sections from Z\u00fcrich to Killwangen-Spreitenbach ([[Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden railway]]) and from Rupperswil to Aarau ([[Heitersberg Railway]]), currently being extended to Olten ([[Olten\u2013Aarau railway]]).\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n[[File:St Albans MMB 02 Midland Main Line 319433.jpg|thumb|Quadruple track section of the [[Midland Main Line]], England]]\n* Significant lengths of the [[West Coast Main Line]], [[Great Western Main Line]], [[South Wales Main Line]], [[Midland Main Line]], [[South Western Main Line]], [[Brighton Main Line]] and [[East Coast Main Line]] in [[Rail transport in Great Britain|Great Britain]] are quadruple track, with the remainder of the lines being double track.

In [[the Bronx]], the Amtrak trains run separate from the New Haven Line. The right-of-way from [[Woodside, Queens]], over the [[Hell Gate Bridge]] to [[Co-op City, Bronx]], is three-tracked due to the presence of the single-tracked [[New York Connecting Railroad]].\n* The [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]] had a four track main line on the former [[Erie Railroad]], from its [[Pavonia Terminal]] in Jersey city to [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]] yard in [[Rockland County, New York]].

Hence, many express services are operated in the New York City Subway. Express trains and local trains are separated with each different track.\n* [[SEPTA Regional Rail|SEPTA]]'s [[Center City Commuter Connection]] in [[Philadelphia]] is quadruple track, as is much of Philadelphia's [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]].\n* [[Reading Company]]'s [[New York Branch]] between [[Neshaminy Falls station|Neshaminy Falls]] and [[Yardley station]] was originally quadruple-tracked before being reduced to three tracks between Neshaminy Falls and [[Woodbourne station]] and two tracks between Woodbourne and Yardley. In 2016, the third track between Woodbourne and Yardley was relaid by SEPTA in order to separate SEPTA's [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]] and CSX's Trenton Subdivision.\n\n===== Midwest =====\n* The [[BNSF Railway Line|BNSF Racetrack]] in [[Chicago]] has a quadruple track section from [[Chicago Union Station|Union Station]] to [[La Vergne (Metra station)|LaVergne]].\n* The [[Chicago \"L\"]] has a four-track section on the [[North Side Main Line (CTA)|North Side Main Line]] ([[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], and [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]] Lines) between [[Howard (CTA station)|Howard]] and [[Fullerton (CTA station)|Fullerton]].\n* The [[Metra Electric District|Metra Electric District Line]] main line in [[Chicago]] is quadrupled between 11th street and 111th street.\n\n===== West coast =====\n* [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco]] had quadruple track streetcars for much of its length in the early 1900s \u2013 two tracks operated by [[United Railroads of San Francisco]] and two tracks operated by the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni). As the streetcar system was acquired by the government and was modernized to light rail, capacity was maintained by tunneling an additional right-of-way for Muni vehicles parallel, under the surface. The [[Market Street Subway]]'s two subterranean levels are both double tracked, and the (retained) double tracked surface section runs [[heritage trolley]] cars for a total of six tracks in the same thoroughfare. The surface and upper level are laid at [[standard gauge]] and maintained by the [[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency]] while the lower level is [[Indian gauge]] track operated by [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]].\n* [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] is quadruple tracked for a short section at the approaches to and at [[MacArthur station (BART)|MacArthur station]] in [[Oakland, California]].

Quadruple-track railways can handle large amounts of traffic, and so are used on very busy routes.\n\n== Advantages ==\n* Quadruple track can manage a larger amount of traffic with usually twice the capacity of double track.  It is often seen around large [[metropolis]] or on busy inter-city corridors.\n* In quadruple track, faster trains can overtake slower ones, and quadrupling can contribute to faster operation of trains. [[High-speed rail]] of 200&nbsp;km/h average speed and [[commuter rail]] of 40&nbsp;km/h average can co-exist in quadruple track without interrupting each other.\n* It is relatively easy to do maintenance and engineering work of tracks in quadruple line with minimum effect of train delay because double-track service is kept even if the other two double tracks are halted during the work.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n* Quadruple track costs more due to requiring more materials and increased land acquisition costs. This also applies to tunneling and bridge costs.\n* When adding tracks, land acquisition can become prohibitively expensive.\n* Maintenance costs are higher and often more complex as there may be more switches (points) on the track than on a two-track line (to facilitate switching from outer to inner tracks and vice versa).\n* For safety, costly [[grade separation]]s are almost always required.\n* If needing more capacity, it can be better to add a double track along a different route, because it could improve local and regional transit much along an under-served route, and reduce land acquisition cost by choosing a less built-up area.\n\n== Operation ==\nIn quadruple track, trains are sorted in various ways in order to make maximum use of track capacity. These can include one or a combination of:\n* '''Sorting by speed'''\nA faster express line and a stopping local line are separated, with each having a separate pair of tracks.\nConstruction of new double tracks dedicated to [[high-speed rail]] alongside existing conventional double track used by regional and local passenger trains and freight trains is a form of quadruple track. It increases the capacity of that route significantly, and allows for significant increases in inter-city high-speed train frequency with reduced travel times.\n* '''Sorting by distance'''\nLong distance [[inter-city rail]] and freight trains are separated from short distance commuter rail. This helps to prevent delays on one service affecting the other, and is commonly seen in metropolitan areas. Quadrupling may be necessary when a new commuter rail service begins to operate on an existing line. Sometimes the local trains have separate technology, such as electrical system or signalling, which requires strict separation, for example in [[Berlin S-Bahn|Berlin]] or [[S-train|Copenhagen]].\n* '''Sorting by destination'''\nWhen a quadruple track line divides to different destinations part way along, trains need to be sorted by their destination.\n* '''Sorting by passenger/ freight'''\nPassenger trains and freight trains can be separated with each different track.\n\nA variation of this can be found on the quadruple track section of the [[Main Northern railway line|Main Northern line]] in [[New South Wales]] between [[Waratah railway station|Waratah]] and [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]] where one pair of tracks are used exclusively for coal trains and the other pair are used for passenger trains and general freight.  A similar process, but with all intercity and commuter passenger trains on the outer tracks and thru-freight trains on the inner tracks, was done by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] on its New York-Washington and Philadelphia-Pittsburgh mainlines prior to the takeover of operations by [[Amtrak]] and [[Conrail]] (and later [[Norfolk Southern]]).  This is somewhat still done to this day by NS, [[CSX]], and Conrail Shared Assets trains on Amtrak-owned trackage in the Philadelphia area.\n* '''Other modes'''\nTwo double track lines along opposite sides of a river can operate as a quadruple track. Examples of this can be found in [[Rhone]] in France and [[Rhine]] in Germany.\n\n== Layouts ==\nAs it can be seen from the pictures below in the Gallery of diagrams, the four tracks can be paired either by direction (slow and fast in each pair) or by purpose (speed or direction in each pair). Sometimes two of the tracks go more straight and with a little distance from the two other. This is a design decision when widening a double track section, and allows higher speed on the faster tracks.\n<gallery>\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Direction - Fast in Centre.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Direction - Platforms in Centre.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Direction - Slow in Centre.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Use.jpg\nFile:Four Tracks Paired by Use SIS.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:COUNTY-Pre-Rebuild-West-Gantry.jpg|thumb|4-track section of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] in New Jersey]]\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== Belgium ====\nSeveral lines radiating from [[Brussels]] are quadrupled, for instance the [[Ghent]]-[[Ostend]] line as far as [[Essene-Lombeek]]. Further quadrupling has recently been carried out as part of the development of the [[Brussels Regional Express Network]]. The building of high-speed lines has also led to quadrupling - for instance the [[HSL 2]] high-speed line between Brussels and [[Cologne]] runs inside the local lines as far as [[Leuven]]. Meanwhile since 1934 Brussels and [[Antwerp]] have been connected by two separate pairs of double track. Fast trains normally use line [[Belgian railway line 25|25]], while line 27 serves slow trains. In places they run parallel, but at times diverge and cross over each other.\n\n==== Denmark ====\n* There are two places in Denmark with four tracks: Between [[Klampenborg]] and [[H\u00f8je Taastrup]], through [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, there are four tracks; two are for the separated [[S-train]]s and two for mainline trains; where the two tracks closest to Copenhagen (the oldest and central parts of Copenhagen) are reserved for S-trains (on much the lines this is the Northern and Western two tracks). Also between [[H\u00f8je Taastrup]] and [[Roskilde]], where the two center tracks are for InterCity, long distance commuter trains (further than [[Roskilde]] or [[Ringsted]]), while the outer two tracks are for commuter trains to/from [[Ringsted]] or [[Holb\u00e6k]]. It has been suggested that the S-trains should continue from H\u00f8je Taastrup to Roskilde, but this plan was abandoned; partly due to Roskilde refusing the offer for fear they would become a suburb of Copenhagen, and partly due to construction costs which would exceed the advantages.\n\n==== Finland ====\n* [[Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki railway]] has four tracks between [[Helsinki Central Station]] and [[Kerava railway station]]\n* [[Rantarata|Helsinki-Turku railway]] has four tracks between [[Helsinki Central Station]] and [[Lepp\u00e4vaara station]]\n\n==== Germany ====\n* The [[Berlin Stadtbahn]], Germany, has four tracks. Two are for the separated [[S-Bahn]] and two for mainline trains.\n* The 112&nbsp;km long [[Hamm\u2013Minden railway]] between [[Hamm]] and [[Minden]] in Germany is completely quadruple-track with separate tracks for freight and passenger trains.\n* The 50&nbsp;km long railway from Rastatt to Offenburg in Germany has four tracks.\n* The [[Hohenzollern Bridge]], with six tracks\n* The line from Munich to Augsburg has four tracks and near Munich even more\n\n==== Ireland ====\n[[File:Kishoge Station.jpg|thumb|Quadrupled section of the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] system]]\n* In [[Ireland]], the busiest section of railway in the country, on the approach to Dublin's [[Heuston railway station|Heuston station]] from [[Hazelhatch and Celbridge railway station|Hazelhatch & Celbridge]] was quadrupled in 2009.\n\n==== Italy ====\n* The [[Rome\u2013Naples high-speed railway]] and the Rome\u2013Sulmona\u2013Pescara railway in Italy combine to form a quadruple track section between Roma Prenestina railway station and Salone railway station.\n* The main section of [[Ferrovie Nord Milano]] line between [[Milan]] and [[Saronno]] in Italy. Outer regional trains are segregated from the inner suburban trains.\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n* The [[Amsterdam\u2013Arnhem railway]] between [[Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA railway station|Amsterdam Bijlmer]] and [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]], the Netherlands, has been quadrupled between 1999 and 2008.\n* The [[Breda\u2013Eindhoven railway]] between [[Boxtel railway station|Boxtel]] and [[Eindhoven railway station|Eindhoven]], the Netherlands, was quadrupled between 1998 and 2002.\n* The [[Breda\u2013Rotterdam railway]] between Rotterdam and Dordrecht has been quadrupled.\n\n==== Portugal ====\n\n* The sub-urban railway axis between [[Agualva-Cac\u00e9m|Mira-Sintra]] and [[Alverca do Ribatejo|Alverca]] in the [[Lisbon metropolitan area|Lisbon Metropolitan]] Area, part of the [[Linha de Sintra]], [[Linha de Cintura|Linha da Cintura]] and [[Linha do Norte]]. Portugal's busiest railway by number of passengers and trains.\n\n==== Sweden ====\n* All of the mainline railway through [[Stockholm County]] (between [[J\u00e4rna]] and Myrbacken north of [[M\u00e4rsta]], {{convert|83|km|mi|abbr=on}}) has four tracks, sometimes having two routes. There are plans to widen Stockholm\u2013[[B\u00e5lsta]] and Myrbacken\u2013[[Uppsala]] to quadruple track with parts finished or under construction. After this, the [[Stockholm commuter rail]] would have its own tracks everywhere.\n* The section between [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Arl\u00f6v]] on the [[Southern Main Line]] has four tracks. As of 2018, an extension to [[Lund]] is expected to be finished in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.trafikverket.se/lund-arlov |title=Lund\u2013Arl\u00f6v, fyra sp\u00e5r |publisher=[[Swedish Transport Administration]] |language=Swedish |access-date=19 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Switzerland ====\n* The 120&nbsp;km long railway from Z\u00fcrich to Olten contains long quadruple track sections from Z\u00fcrich to Killwangen-Spreitenbach ([[Z\u00fcrich\u2013Baden railway]]) and from Rupperswil to Aarau ([[Heitersberg Railway]]), currently being extended to Olten ([[Olten\u2013Aarau railway]]).\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n[[File:St Albans MMB 02 Midland Main Line 319433.jpg|thumb|Quadruple track section of the [[Midland Main Line]], England]]\n* Significant lengths of the [[West Coast Main Line]], [[Great Western Main Line]], [[South Wales Main Line]], [[Midland Main Line]], [[South Western Main Line]] [[Brighton Main Line]] and [[East Coast Main Line]] in [[Rail transport in Great Britain|Great Britain]] are quadruple track, with the remainder of the lines being double track. These lines are high capacity, intercity rail routes.\n\n=== The Americas ===\n\n==== United States ====\n\n===== East coast =====\n* The [[New York Central]]'s Water Level Route across [[upstate New York]] was four-tracked in majority as early as 1876, claiming to be the earliest 4-tracked steel main.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-map.com/picture/004/Railroad-Central-Hudson-River.htm|title=New York Central and Hudson River Railroad|website=www.history-map.com}}</ref> This was extended to Buffalo by 1936.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/NYC/NYC%20Maps/NYC%20Buffalo%20Mileage%20Chart%201-1-1936.pdf|title=New York Central Mileage Chart 1936|website=multimodalways.org}}</ref> Financial troubles and changing traffic patterns caused this to be downgraded to a [[double track]] by 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/PCTC/PCTC%20Track%20Charts/PCTC%20Buffalo%20Track%20Chart%201-1-1975%20P.pdf|title=Penn Central Transportation Company Track Chart 1975|website=multimodalways.org}}</ref>\n* The [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] is four-tracked from [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]] to [[New Haven Union Station]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].\n* Much of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], to New Haven, Connecticut, is a four-track line, except for the segment between [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] and the [[Sunnyside Yard]] in [[Queens]], New York. In [[the Bronx]], the Amtrak trains run separate from the New Haven Line. The right-of-way from [[Woodside, Queens]], over the [[Hell Gate Bridge]] to [[Co-op City, Bronx]], is three-tracked due to the presence of the single-tracked [[New York Connecting Railroad]].\n* The [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]] had a four track main line on the former [[Erie Railroad]], from its [[Pavonia Terminal]] in Jersey city to [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]] yard in [[Rockland County, New York]]. This allowed separation of freight and commuter trains. The EL Rwy also inherited former [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna]] four-track [[Montclair-Boonton Line|Boonton]] [[Main line (railway)|Main Line]] from [[Dover (NJT station)|Dover, NJ]], to [[Delawanna (NJT station)|Delawanna (Passaic), NJ]].\n* The [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] had a four track main from the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey|CNJ Terminal]] in [[Jersey City]] to [[Phillipsburg, NJ]], across from [[Easton, PA]].\n* The Long Island Rail Road's [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] is four-tracked from its [[East River Tunnels]] [[portal (architecture)|portal]] in [[Long Island City]] to [[Queens Village, NY]].\n* The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] had a four-track mainline carrying freight from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg via the [[Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)]]. This was how the name ''[[Broadway Limited]]'' came about from the \"Broadway of a 4-track main.\" Much of the route between Pittsburgh and Paoli has been downgraded to three or two tracks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n* Many lines of the [[New York City Subway]] are quadrupled \u2013 one of the few rapid transit systems in the United States to have extensive duplication. Hence, many express services are operated in the New York City Subway. Express trains and local trains are separated with each different track.\n* [[SEPTA Regional Rail|SEPTA]]'s [[Center City Commuter Connection]] in [[Philadelphia]] is quadruple track, as is much of Philadelphia's [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]].\n* [[Reading Company]]'s [[New York Branch]] between [[Neshaminy Falls station|Neshaminy Falls]] and [[Yardley station]] was originally quadruple-tracked before being reduced to three tracks between Neshaminy Falls and [[Woodbourne station]] and two tracks between Woodbourne and Yardley. In 2016, the third track between Woodbourne and Yardley was relaid by SEPTA in order to separate SEPTA's [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]] and CSX's Trenton Subdivision.\n\n===== Midwest =====\n* The [[BNSF Railway Line|BNSF Racetrack]] in [[Chicago]] has a quadruple track section from [[Chicago Union Station|Union Station]] to [[La Vergne (Metra station)|LaVergne]].\n* The [[Chicago \"L\"]] has a four-track section on the [[North Side Main Line (CTA)|North Side Main Line]] ([[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], and [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]] Lines) between [[Howard (CTA station)|Howard]] and [[Fullerton (CTA station)|Fullerton]].\n* The [[Metra Electric District|Metra Electric District Line]] main line in [[Chicago]] is quadrupled between 11th street and 111th street.\n\n===== West coast =====\n* [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco]] had quadruple track streetcars for much of its length in the early 1900s \u2013 two tracks operated by [[United Railroads of San Francisco]] and two tracks operated by the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni). As the streetcar system was acquired by the government and was modernized to light rail, capacity was maintained by tunneling an additional right-of-way for Muni vehicles parallel, under the surface. The [[Market Street Subway]]'s two subterranean levels are both double tracked, and the (retained) double tracked surface section runs [[heritage trolley]] cars for a total of six tracks in the same thoroughfare. The surface and upper level are laid at [[standard gauge]] and maintained by the [[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency]] while the lower level is [[Indian gauge]] track operated by [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]].\n* [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] is quadruple tracked for a short section at the approaches to and at [[MacArthur station (BART)|MacArthur station]] in [[Oakland, California]]. The transit system had plans that called for [[Market Street Subway]] to be fully quadruple tracked to their unique operational specifications, with express trains running on a separate level than local trains; the final system was reconfigured due to budget constraints.\n* [[Caltrain]] commuter rail service was partially quad-tracked in short sections to enable [[Caltrain Express|Baby Bullet express service]].\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n==== China ====\n[[File:Huning Lines.jpg|thumb|Huning Lines]]\n\n* [[Beijing\u2013Baotou Railway]] is quadruplicated in 2012 between Hohhot East and [[Baotou railway station]] with one pair of tracks for conventional services of the [[Beijing\u2013Baotou Railway]] and a pair for high speed trains that continue into the [[Zhangjiakou\u2013Hohhot High-Speed Railway]]. \n* The [[Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen Railway]] is quadruplicated in 2007 for its entire length separating high-speed passenger with freight and conventional passenger services. It is the first railway in China to do so. The third track was added in 2000, but the mixing of services heading in one direction caused disruption in schedules, so the fourth track was built allowing for complete separation.\n* The [[Shanghai\u2013Nanjing Intercity Railway]] runs follows the same alignment to the slower conventional [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway|Nanjing\u2013Shanghai Railway]] between [[Zhenjiang]] and [[Suzhou]]. In [[Kunshan]] it follows the [[Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway]] effectively making it a 4-track corridor for a majority of its length.\n* The [[Qingdao\u2013Jinan High-Speed Railway|Jiaozhou-Jinan Passenger Dedicated Line]] runs shares the same alignment to the slower conventional [[Jiaozhou\u2013Jinan Railway]], effectively making the Jiaoji Line as a quadruple track corridor. This is not to be confused with the [[Qingdao\u2013Jinan High-Speed Railway]] which is another parallel railway running on a new alignment several kilometers north of the Jiaoji Line.\n* The [[Datong\u2013Xi'an Passenger Railway]] and the [[Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway]] parallel each other between [[Xi'an]] and [[Weinan]] with a pair of tracks for each line.\n* The [[Nanning\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] and [[Guiyang\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] run beside each other between [[Guangzhou]] and [[Dinghu District|Dinghu]] with a pair of tracks for each line.\n* The [[Nanning\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]] and [[Liuzhou\u2013Nanning Intercity Railway]] run beside each other between [[Nanning]] and [[Binyang County|Binyang]] with a pair of tracks for each line.\n<!--Qingdao\u2013Jinan_High-Speed_Railway article title is wrong, the article is describing the Passenger-Dominated Line (250 km/h)-->\n* [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway]] (Nanchang\u2013Jiujiang section) / [[Nanchang\u2013Jiujiang Intercity Railway]].

Paektu, Jong Il Peak and Tonghung Hill in Hamhung City where the statue of President Kim Il Sung is standing at a time when all Korean people are mourning the demise of leader Kim Jong Il in bitterest sorrow.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 17 layers of ice were broken on Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu, shaking the lake with big noise.\n\nThe Group for Comprehensive Exploration of Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu said it was the first time that such big noise was heard from the ridge of Janggun Peak and the lake.\n\nThe temperature on Mt. Paektu that day registered 22.4 degrees Celsius below zero and there was strong wind accompanied by snowstorm measuring 18 meters per second.\n\nThe snowstorm stopped blowing all of a sudden from dawn of Tuesday and heavy clouds were seen hanging around Hyangdo Peak.\n\nAt around 8:05&nbsp;am the sky began turning red with sunrise on the horizon. The peaks looked like a picture for wide and thick glow.\n\nKim Jong Il's autographic writings \"Mt. Paektu, holy mountain of revolution. Kim Jong Il.\" carved on the mountain, in particular, were bright with glow.\n\nThis phenomenon lasted till 5:00&nbsp;pm.\n\nGlow was seen atop Jong Il Peak for half an hour from 16:50 on Dec. 19 when the nation was shocked by the news of the leader's demise. This was the first of its kind in dozens of years since the observation of the area was started.\n\nA natural wonder was also observed around the statue of the President standing on Tonghung Hill.\n\nAt around 21:20 Tuesday a Manchurian crane was seen flying round the statue three times before alighting on a tree. The crane stayed there for quite a long while with its head drooped and flew in the direction of Pyongyang at around 22:00.\n\nObserving this, the director of the Management Office for the Hamhung Revolutionary Site, and others said in union that even the crane seemed to mourn the demise of Kim Jong Il born of Heaven after flying down there at dead of cold night, unable to forget him.|source=KCNA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kcna.co.jp/item/2011/201112/news21/20111221-49ee.html |accessdate=13 January 2012 |title=Natural Wonders Observed |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107220128/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2011/201112/news21/20111221-49ee.html |archivedate=7 January 2012 }}</ref>{{Long quote|date=May 2016}}}}\n{{Clear}}\nIn the past, the North Korean government has been known to encourage stories of miraculous deeds and supernatural events credited to Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} KCNA also claimed that more than five million North Koreans, more than 25% of the national population, had shown up to mourn Kim.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2011/12/18/kim-jong-il-is-dead/ Chronological coverage] at North Korean Economy Watch\n* [http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2012/01/13/kim-jong-ils-funeral-procession/ Route of the funeral procession] at North Korean Economy Watch\n\n{{Kim Jong-il}}\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Politics|North Korea}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kim, Jong-il, Death and Funeral of}}\n[[Category:2011 in North Korea]]\n[[Category:History of the Workers' Party of Korea]]\n[[Category:Deaths by person|Kim, Jong-il]]\n[[Category:Kim Jong-il|Death]]\n[[Category:Funerals by person|Kim, Jong-il]]\n[[Category:Funerals in North Korea|Kim, Jong-il]]\n[[Category:21st century in Pyongyang]]\n[[Category:December 2011 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Kim Myong-sik", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Kim_Jong-il"}

In the first regular March session, Republicans superseded the Crittenden Resolution, removing the prohibition against emancipation of slaves.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}}\n\nIn South Carolina, Gen. [[David Hunter]], issued a General Order in early May 1862 freeing all slaves in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. President Lincoln quickly rescinded the order, reserving this \"supposed power\" to his own discretion if it were indispensable to saving the Union.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lprbscsm&fileName=scsm0579/lprbscsmscsm0579.db \"Presidential Proclamation May 19, 1862\"], Abraham Lincoln's response to General Hunter's General Order Number Eleven. [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] was to be outside the police functions of field commanders.</ref> Later in the same month without directly disobeying Lincoln's prohibition against emancipation, General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] at [[Fort Monroe#1860\u201361|Fort Monroe]] Virginia declared slaves escaped into his lines as \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] of war\", that is, forfeit to their rebel owners.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 New York Times: \"How Slavery Really Ended in America\"] Viewed November 9, 2011.</ref> On May 24, Congress followed General Butler's lead, and passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|First Confiscation Act]] in August, freeing slaves used for rebellion.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\">McPherson, p. 57-58</ref>\n\nIn Missouri, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], the 1856 Republican nominee for President, exceeded his authority as a General, declaring that all slaves held by rebels within his military district would be freed.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\"/> Republican majorities in Congress responded on opening day of the December Session. Sen. [[Lyman Trumbull]] introduced a bill for confiscation of rebel property and emancipation for their slaves. \"Acrimonious debate on confiscation proved a major preoccupation\" of Congress.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}} On March 13, 1862, Congress directed the armies of the United States to stop enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. The next month, the Congress [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|abolished slavery in the District of Columbia]] with compensation for loyal citizens. An additional [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act in July]] declared free all slaves held by citizens in rebellion, but it had no practical effect without addressing where the act would take effect, or how ownership was to be proved.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}}\n\nLincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation was issued September 22, 1862.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}} It became the principal issue before the public in the mid-term elections that year for the 38th Congress. But Republican majorities in both houses held (see 'Congress as a campaign machine' below), and the Republicans actually increased their majority in the Senate.<ref>McPherson, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1863, the war measure by executive proclamation directed the army and the navy to treat all escaped slaves as free when entering Union lines from territory still in rebellion.

Chandler, who had been one of McClellan's advocates promoting his spectacular rise,<ref>McPherson, p. 76</ref> particularly documented criticism of McClellan's Peninsular Campaign with its circuitous maneuvering, endless entrenchment and murderous camp diseases.

It would create the modern Congressional era in which generals fought wars with Congress looking over their shoulders, \"and with public opinion following closely behind.\"{{sfn | Neely | page=212\u2013213}}\n\n=== Republican Platform goals ===\n\nRepublican majorities in both houses, apart from pro-union Democrats, and without vacant southern delegations, were able to enact their party platform. These included the [[Legal Tender Act]], February 20, 1862, and increases in the tariff that amounted to protective tariffs. The Homestead Act, May 20, 1862, for government lands, and the Morrill Land Grant Act, July 2, 1862, for universities promoting practical arts in agriculture and mining, had no immediate war purpose. But they would have long range effects, as would the [[Pacific Railroad Act]], July 1, 1862, for a transcontinental railroad.{{sfn | Neely | page=211}}\n\nTreasury innovations were driven by Secretary [[Salmon P.

In the first regular March session, Republicans superseded the Crittenden Resolution, removing the prohibition against emancipation of slaves.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}}\n\nIn South Carolina, Gen. [[David Hunter]], issued a General Order in early May 1862 freeing all slaves in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. President Lincoln quickly rescinded the order, reserving this \"supposed power\" to his own discretion if it were indispensable to saving the Union.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lprbscsm&fileName=scsm0579/lprbscsmscsm0579.db \"Presidential Proclamation May 19, 1862\"], Abraham Lincoln's response to General Hunter's General Order Number Eleven. [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] was to be outside the police functions of field commanders.</ref> Later in the same month without directly disobeying Lincoln's prohibition against emancipation, General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] at [[Fort Monroe#1860\u201361|Fort Monroe]] Virginia declared slaves escaped into his lines as \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] of war\", that is, forfeit to their rebel owners.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 New York Times: \"How Slavery Really Ended in America\"] Viewed November 9, 2011.</ref> On May 24, Congress followed General Butler's lead, and passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|First Confiscation Act]] in August, freeing slaves used for rebellion.<ref name=\"McPherson, p. 57-58\">McPherson, p. 57-58</ref>\n\nIn Missouri, [[John C.

Sen. [[Lyman Trumbull]] introduced a bill for confiscation of rebel property and emancipation for their slaves. \"Acrimonious debate on confiscation proved a major preoccupation\" of Congress.{{sfn | Neely | page=210}} On March 13, 1862, Congress directed the armies of the United States to stop enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. The next month, the Congress [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|abolished slavery in the District of Columbia]] with compensation for loyal citizens. An additional [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act in July]] declared free all slaves held by citizens in rebellion, but it had no practical effect without addressing where the act would take effect, or how ownership was to be proved.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}}\n\nLincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation was issued September 22, 1862.{{sfn | Neely | page=214}} It became the principal issue before the public in the mid-term elections that year for the 38th Congress. But Republican majorities in both houses held (see 'Congress as a campaign machine' below), and the Republicans actually increased their majority in the Senate.<ref>McPherson, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1863, the war measure by executive proclamation directed the army and the navy to treat all escaped slaves as free when entering Union lines from territory still in rebellion.
