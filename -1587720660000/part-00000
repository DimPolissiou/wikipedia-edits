It won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].<ref name=\"AM\" />\n\n==Recording==\n''The Missing Years'' was Prine's first studio release since his 1986 album ''German Afternoons'' and is regarded as his comeback album.  According to the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes,  manager Al Bunetta and longtime Prine associate Dan Einstein were brainstorming over prospective producers at Oh Boy headquarters and the name of [[Howie Epstein]] came up.  Epstein, the bass player in [[Tom Petty]]'s Heartbreakers, was a longtime fan, with Prine recalling \"I'd heard for years that he and (Heartbreakers keyboard player) [[Benmont Tench]] would show up at my shows.  And I heard all the guys in the Heartbreakers played my stuff on the road.  So Al called Howie.  And before he could even hang up the phone, Howie was in the office.  Four hours later, he was still there, talking to my manager about my music.\"  [[Roger Waters]] and [[Michael Kamen]] were also very interested in producing Prine's new album.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=139|2015}} Although it was partially recorded at The Money Pit in [[Nashville]],  it was mostly recorded at Huh Sound Theater in [[Los Angeles]] (actually Epstein's guest bedroom on Laurelcrest Drive),{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=140|2015}} which led to a coterie of famous contributors, including Tom Petty, [[Phil Everly]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Albert Lee]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]].  Prine had bumped into Springsteen at an Italian restaurant the day he arrived to record, with Springsteen telling Prine, \"When you guys get into the record and have something to play, please invite me over.  I'd just love to play guitar or harmonica or sing or whatever.\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=144|2015}}  Prine told the ''Phoenix New Times'' in a 1991 interview, \"Howie has one of those houses that looks like it's going to fall off the cliff.  But it was great.  All we paid for was the musicians, the tape and the engineer.  I recorded most of it in a hallway.  I mean a hallway - we're talkin' three-and-a-half feet wide.\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=141|2015}}\n\n==Composition==\nAlthough many listeners might assume that the album's title might allude to Prine's recent sabbatical from the music business, it actually refers to the song \"Jesus The Missing Years\", which speculates upon the unrecorded middle 18 years of [[Christ]]'s life.  The surreal piece features, among other things, Jesus traveling to [[France]] and [[Spain]], marrying an [[Irish people|Irish]] bride, inventing [[Santa Claus]], and opening a show for country singer [[George Jones]].  \"All The Best\" dealt with the theme of [[divorce]], with the singer commenting before a performance of the song on Irish TV in 1990, \"Country songs and country songwriters are a strange lot.  Seems like some of the best country songs over the years have come from some of the sadder situations in life - like divorce.  Having recently acquired my second divorce, about a month later the song truck pulled up and dumped a bunch of great songs on my lawn.\"\n\nIn the ''Great Days'' anthology, Prine recalls that \"The Sins Of Memphisto\" was written under pressure from producer Epstein:  \"We were 12 cuts into ''The Missing Years'', and Howie says, 'We need one or two more cuts.'  And I went, 'You're kidding.  From where?  We've been working for nine months.  I don't have anything hiding on the shelf.  You could take a autopsy, and you won't find a song inside of me.' So I went and locked myself in a hotel room and went, 'If he wants a song, he'll get a song.'  I tried to write one from as far in left field as I could and came up with 'Memphisto'.\"  Prine biographer Eddie Huffman calls the song \"a casually visionary song about loss of innocence, relationships, sex, aging, and the passage of time, one of the most remarkable in Prine's catalog, effortlessly tying together various lyrical threads from throughout his career as a songwriter.\"{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=142|2015}}\n\n''The Missing Years'' also features \"Take A Look At My Heart\" (co-written with rocker [[John Mellencamp]]) and collaborations with Keith Sykes and British songwriter [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]].  Prine covers the [[Lefty Frizzell]] classic \"I Want To Be With You Always,\" while \"Daddy's Little Pumpkin\" was partly inspired by [[Mississippi John Hurt]], who [[Pat McLaughlin]] reintroduced Prine to at the time.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=142|2015}}  The album opener \"Picture Show\" (which features Tom Petty on background vocals) reflects Prine's lifelong love of movies and namechecks [[John Garfield]], [[James Dean]], and [[Montgomery Clift]], while \"It's a Big Old Goofy World\" was inspired by his mother Verna's love of crossword puzzles.{{sfn|Huffman, Eddie|p=144-145|2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlman |title= ''The Missing Years'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r15828 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 =[[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev2Score = (A-) <ref name=\"RC\">{{cite web |first= Robert |last= Christgau|title= ''The Missing Years'' > Review |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=John+Prine |publisher=[[Robert Christgau]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|4}} <ref name=\"CT\">{{cite journal |last=Van Matre |first=Lynn |title=Review: ''The Missing Years'' |journal=[[Chicago Tribune]] |issue= |date=October 1991 |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-10-31/features/9104070905_1_missing-years-all-star-john-prine |page=}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = (A-)<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite journal |last=Nash |first=Alanna |title=Review: ''The Missing Years'' |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue= |date=November 1991 |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316253,00.html |page=}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=4th|isbn=978-0195313734|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>\n}}\n''The Missing Years'' was well received by critics and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].

R.

After three days in captivity, 14 officers are released, but one is murdered. The police find a tape recording and a file on the dead officer's body that provide significant evidence concerning the [[kidnapping]] and subsequent murder. The file suggests that the crimes were committed by members of the self-proclaimed \"Anti-[[Corruption]] Force\" (ACF), a citizen militia seeking to eliminate corruption through vigilante acts. The militia, acting as a [[kangaroo court]], \"sentenced\" corrupt officials in the area to death, beginning with the captured revenue officers who were apparently engaging in criminal activity.\n\nThe film's setting then shifts to M. Ramanaa, a mild-mannered professor at [[National College, Bangalore|National College]], who lives in a house with four adopted kids. While treating his adopted child at a big private hospital, Ramanaa discovers that the officials at the facility are engaging in [[extortion]] and [[fraud]]. After collecting evidence of the hospital staff's deception, Ramanaa turns them over to the authorities. The ringleader is the hospital dean, Rishi, who commits suicide when this is discovered. His grief-stricken father, a big and powerful construction magnate named Bhadrinarayanan, vows to take revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. Meanwhile, the ACF goes on kidnapping the top 15 corrupt officials each month and then killing the #1. Those officials include officials from transport, PWD, revenue, sports, health, etc. Then, suddenly, Devaki, a college girl and friend of Ramana's kids, finds out about him being the leader of the ACF. She questions him about this immoral activity.\n\nSeven years ago, Ramana was a college professor with a small cute family, of him, his nine-month pregnant wife Chitra, and his daughter. During the festival of [[Diwali|Deepavali]], Ramanaa's apartment building collapses due to heavy construction work near-by, killing many residents including Chitra and his daughter. Recovering from the incident, he demands to know who was responsible for the building's collapse. He discovers that the building was built and owned by Bhadrinarayanan, who knowingly constructed the complex on loose soil. When Ramanaa confronts the District Council with evidence, Bhadrinarayanan walks in and boasts about all the bribe he has thrown to the top district officials including the collector. he gives Ramanaa a chance to call any two top officials in the state and get him arrested, but both the officials who are called immediately hang up. Frustrated, Ramanaa seals the room and attacks all officers, and as he is about to kill Bhadrinarayanan, he is beaten badly by his men, and is thrown on a highway. He is then rescued by National college students, who were on a trip. In response to Bhadrinarayanan's actions, and the general corruption in the region, Ramanaa forms the Anti-Corruption Force (ACF). Ramanaa and the ACF ultimately capture and hang Bhadrinarayanan, along with other corrupt government officials.\n\nMeanwhile, a local police constable, frustrated for being not promoted, as he could not bribe officials, begins secretly building the case against the ACF. The constable eventually realizes that the ACF is primarily composed of people who do not take bribes. He visits multiple revenue offices, but his superiors neglect him due to him being their low associate. Then, a message comes saying that civil supply officers are going to be taken. All corrupt officials try to get police protection by proving their corruption, but at the last moment, the ACF switches to Police department. All corrupt civil supply officers are arrested, and the government promises to employ 25,000 youngsters within a week. 15 district police chiefs are kidnapped. The police officer is killed, and everyone is frustrated. An IPS Punjabi officer is flown from Delhi to head the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Bhadrinarayanan is trying to re-corrupt the officials. As the final stroke, the top 15 dons are kidnapped. Ramanaa personally comes to Bhadrinarayanan. As was done to him, he gives the same lifeline to Bhadri, to call any two people within India. This time, Bhadrinarayanan fails, and is kidnapped and later killed. Then, the constable reveals his plan to his superiors, and the IPS officer is delighted.\n\nThe officer takes swift action against them. The ACF members are captured and tortured by the police but refuse to reveal Ramanaa's identity. Ramanaa is overcome with guilt over his students' sacrifice and surrenders himself, on the condition that all the other members of the ACF be released. He is tried and convicted of being the mastermind organiser behind the murders of Bhadrinarayanan and 14 other government officials, and is sentenced to death. Public pressure from the sympathetic community and family makes the Chief Minister offer Ramanaa a pardon appeal, which will definitely give him complete freedom. However, Ramanaa refuses, stating that only he must face the consequences of his actions, and is [[Hanging|hanged]] the next day. The constable is offered a promotion for his role in disbanding the ACF, but he refuses out of guilt.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijayakanth]] as M.

Ramanaa is overcome with guilt over his students' sacrifice and surrenders himself, on the condition that all the other members of the ACF be released. He is tried and convicted of being the mastermind organiser behind the murders of Bhadrinarayanan and 14 other government officials, and is sentenced to death. Public pressure from the sympathetic community and family makes the Chief Minister offer Ramanaa a pardon appeal, which will definitely give him complete freedom. However, Ramanaa refuses, stating that only he must face the consequences of his actions, and is [[Hanging|hanged]] the next day. The constable is offered a promotion for his role in disbanding the ACF, but he refuses out of guilt.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijayakanth]] as M.

The [[Snooker world rankings 2018/2019|rankings at the start of 2018/2019 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2016/2017|2016/2017]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2017/2018|2017/2018]] seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2018/2019 season, all of the points from the 2017/2018 season, and the points from the 2016/2017 season that have not yet been dropped. \n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n<ref>{{Cite web |title=Calendar 2018/2019 |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calendar_2018_19_v15.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127221420/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calendar_2018_19_v15.pdf |accessdate=24 February 2019 |archivedate=27 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Indicative Prize Money Rankings Schedule 2018/2019 |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here-for-the-prize-money.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719104200/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here-for-the-prize-money.pdf |date=18 July 2018 |archivedate=19 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=2018/2019 Re-ranking Points List (Seeding Cut-off Points) |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719104424/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here.pdf |date=18 July 2018 |archivedate=19 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

professional [[snooker]] players on the [[World Snooker Tour#Main Tour|World Snooker Main Tour]] in the [[Snooker season 2018/2019|2018/2019 season]] are based on performances in ranking [[List of snooker tournaments|tournaments]] over a two-year rolling period. The [[Snooker world rankings 2018/2019|rankings at the start of 2018/2019 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2016/2017|2016/2017]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2017/2018|2017/2018]] seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2018/2019 season, all of the points from the 2017/2018 season, and the points from the 2016/2017 season that have not yet been dropped. \n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n<ref>{{Cite web |title=Calendar 2018/2019 |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calendar_2018_19_v15.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127221420/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Calendar_2018_19_v15.pdf |accessdate=24 February 2019 |archivedate=27 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Indicative Prize Money Rankings Schedule 2018/2019 |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here-for-the-prize-money.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719104200/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here-for-the-prize-money.pdf |date=18 July 2018 |archivedate=19 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=2018/2019 Re-ranking Points List (Seeding Cut-off Points) |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719104424/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Click-here.pdf |date=18 July 2018 |archivedate=19 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

The [[Snooker world rankings 2017/2018|rankings at the start of 2017/2018 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2015/2016|2015/2016]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2016/2017|2016/2017]] seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2017/2018 season, all of the points from the 2016/2017 season, and the points from the 2015/2016 season that have not yet been dropped.\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n<ref>{{Cite web |title=Calendar 2017/2018 |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2017-18-calendar.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004122845/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2017-18-calendar.pdf |format=PDF |archivedate=4 October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indicative Prize Money Rankings Schedule 2017/2018 Season |date=11 July 2017|work=World Snooker|publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]]|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-Here-For-The-Prize-Money-Schedule.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715124335/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-Here-For-The-Prize-Money-Schedule.pdf|format=PDF|archivedate=15 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=reranking>{{cite web|title=2017/2018 Re-ranking Points List|work=World Snooker|publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]]|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-here-for-the-seeding-cut-off-information.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715124524/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-here-for-the-seeding-cut-off-information.pdf |format=PDF|archivedate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

'''2017/2018 snooker [[Snooker world rankings|world ranking]] points''' for the professional [[snooker]] players on the [[World Snooker Tour#Main Tour|World Snooker Main Tour]] in the [[Snooker season 2017/2018|2017/2018 season]] are based on performances in ranking [[List of snooker tournaments|tournaments]] over a two-year rolling period. The [[Snooker world rankings 2017/2018|rankings at the start of 2017/2018 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2015/2016|2015/2016]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2016/2017|2016/2017]] seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2017/2018 season, all of the points from the 2016/2017 season, and the points from the 2015/2016 season that have not yet been dropped.\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n<ref>{{Cite web |title=Calendar 2017/2018 |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2017-18-calendar.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004122845/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2017-18-calendar.pdf |format=PDF |archivedate=4 October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indicative Prize Money Rankings Schedule 2017/2018 Season |date=11 July 2017|work=World Snooker|publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]]|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-Here-For-The-Prize-Money-Schedule.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715124335/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-Here-For-The-Prize-Money-Schedule.pdf|format=PDF|archivedate=15 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=reranking>{{cite web|title=2017/2018 Re-ranking Points List|work=World Snooker|publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]]|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-here-for-the-seeding-cut-off-information.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715124524/http://www.worldsnooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Click-here-for-the-seeding-cut-off-information.pdf |format=PDF|archivedate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

United then formed [[United\u2013Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|a coalition government]] with Reform, making Labour the Opposition. The coalition retained power in the {{NZ election link|1931}}, but gradually, the public became highly dissatisfied with its failure to resolve the country's economic problems. Harry Holland died in 1933 and was replaced by his deputy Michael Joseph Savage as party leader. In the {{NZ election link|1935}}, the Labour Party gained a significant majority, gaining 53 seats to the coalition's 19, and returned to government.\n\nSeveral of the early Labour Party stalwarts were Australian-born: [[Alfred Hindmarsh]], [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Bob Semple]], [[Paddy Webb]], [[Bill Parry (politician)|Bill Parry]] and later [[Jerry Skinner]], [[Mabel Howard]], [[Hugh Watt]] and [[Dorothy Jelicich]].\n\n=== First Government (1935\u20131949) and opposition ===\n{{main|First Labour Government of New Zealand}}\n[[File:Michael Joseph Savage Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Joseph Savage, the first Prime Minister from the Labour Party]]\nParty leader [[Michael Joseph Savage]] became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour's first term in office.

While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the \"doctrinaire\" Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. Some within the party, however, were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A. Lee]]. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and [[social credit]] theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, Lee [[The Lee Affair|was expelled]] from the party, establishing his own breakaway [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John A Lee|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/john-a-lee|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSavage died in 1940, and was replaced by [[Peter Fraser]], who became Labour's longest-serving prime minister. Fraser is best known as New Zealand's leader for most of [[World War II]]. In the [[post-war]] period, however, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity, and the National Party, under [[Sidney Holland]], gained ground although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 elections. Eventually, in the {{NZ election link|1949}}, Labour was defeated.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=133}}\n\nFraser died shortly afterwards, and was replaced by [[Walter Nash]], the long-serving [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=136}} It was to be some time before Labour would return to power, however \u2013 Nash lacked the charisma of his predecessors, and National won considerable support for opposing the \"industrial anarchy\" of the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]].

It governed [[Second Labour Government of New Zealand|from 1957 to 1960]], and again [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|from 1972 to 1975]] (a single [[term of office|term]] each time). In 1974, the prime minister [[Norman Kirk]] died in office, which contributed to a decline in party support. Up to the 1980s, the party advocated a strong role for governments in economic and social matters. When it governed from [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|1984 to 1990]], Labour instead [[privatised]] [[State ownership|state assets]] and reduced the role of the state in the economy; Labour prime minister [[David Lange]] also introduced [[New Zealand's nuclear-free policy]]. Labour again became the largest party [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|from 1999 to 2008]], when it governed in coalition with, or on the basis of negotiated support from, several minor parties; [[Helen Clark]] became the first Labour prime minister to lead her government through a third term in office.<!-- Savage, Fraser and Lange won two terms each. -->\n\nSince the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] Labour has comprised the second-largest [[caucus]] represented in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice Labour Party politicians regard themselves as part of a broader [[labour movement]] and tradition.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Labour Party: The labour movement in New Zealand|url=http://www.labour.org.nz/history|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\n{{formation of New Zealand Labour Party}}\nThe New Zealand Labour Party was an amalgamation of a number of early groups, the oldest of which was founded in 1901. The process of unifying these diverse groups into a single party was difficult, with tensions between different factions running strong.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=13}}\n\nAt the turn of the century, the radical side of New Zealand [[working class]] politics was represented by the [[New Zealand Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], founded in 1901. The more moderate leftists were generally supporters of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=13f}} In 1905, a group of working class politicians who were dissatisfied with the Liberal approach established the [[Independent Political Labour League]],{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=17f}} which managed to win a seat in Parliament in the {{NZ election link|1908}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=216}}{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=19}} This established the basic dividing line in New Zealand's left-wing politics \u2013 the Socialists tended to be revolutionary and militant, while the moderates focused instead on progressive reform.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\"/>\n\nIn 1910, the Independent Political Labour League was relaunched as an organisation called the [[New Zealand Labour Party (1910)|Labour Party]], distinct from the modern party. Soon, however, the leaders of the new organisation decided additional effort was needed to promote left-wing cooperation, and organised a \"[[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1912 conference|Unity Conference]]\". The Socialists refused to attend, but several independent labour activists agreed. The [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] was born.<ref name=\"McLintock1966\">{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-8 |title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |chapter=Labour Party |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manat\u016b Taonga]] |editor-first=A.

United then formed [[United\u2013Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|a coalition government]] with Reform, making Labour the Opposition. The coalition retained power in the {{NZ election link|1931}}, but gradually, the public became highly dissatisfied with its failure to resolve the country's economic problems. Harry Holland died in 1933 and was replaced by his deputy Michael Joseph Savage as party leader. In the {{NZ election link|1935}}, the Labour Party gained a significant majority, gaining 53 seats to the coalition's 19, and returned to government.\n\nSeveral of the early Labour Party stalwarts were Australian-born: [[Alfred Hindmarsh]], [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Bob Semple]], [[Paddy Webb]], [[Bill Parry (politician)|Bill Parry]] and later [[Jerry Skinner]], [[Mabel Howard]], [[Hugh Watt]] and [[Dorothy Jelicich]].\n\n=== First Government (1935\u20131949) and opposition ===\n{{main|First Labour Government of New Zealand}}\n[[File:Michael Joseph Savage Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Joseph Savage, the first Prime Minister from the Labour Party]]\nParty leader [[Michael Joseph Savage]] became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour's first term in office.

While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the \"doctrinaire\" Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. Some within the party, however, were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A. Lee]]. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and [[social credit]] theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, Lee [[The Lee Affair|was expelled]] from the party, establishing his own breakaway [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John A Lee|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/john-a-lee|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSavage died in 1940, and was replaced by [[Peter Fraser]], who became Labour's longest-serving prime minister.

In the [[post-war]] period, however, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity, and the National Party, under [[Sidney Holland]], gained ground although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 elections. Eventually, in the {{NZ election link|1949}}, Labour was defeated.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=133}}\n\nFraser died shortly afterwards, and was replaced by [[Walter Nash]], the long-serving [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=136}} It was to be some time before Labour would return to power, however \u2013 Nash lacked the charisma of his predecessors, and National won considerable support for opposing the \"industrial anarchy\" of the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]].

His foreign policy stances included strong criticism of [[nuclear weapon]]s testing and of [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] system.
