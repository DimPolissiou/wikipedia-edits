There were agreements with Australia (1953), New Zealand (1956) and Canada (1959) but these did not require payment of up-rated pensions.

Admissibility Issues ====\n\n===== A. The Chamber's Conclusions =====\n\n*The ECHR Fourth Section had previously decided that the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken alone was inadmissible. It also decided that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 was admissible, and that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 did not need to be examined.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 53''</sup>\n\n===== B. The parties' submissions =====\n\n*Article 1 of Protocol No. 1:<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 54''</sup>\n#The adding of \"country of residence\" in determining whether a UK pensioner should receive the annual state pension increase involved a ''\"deprivation or interference\"'' with the right to receiving the annual increase;\n#The ''\"possession\"'' that UK pensioners have (in the state pension they receive) was being eroded every year for which they did not receive the annual increase. \nThe applicants argued that the ECHR Fourth section had only dealt with the first of the two complaints above.\n*Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 had not been heard in UK court proceedings brought by Carson (alone), and therefore should not have been dismissed so lightly in the ECHR Fourth Section.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 55''</sup>\n*The Government said that:<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 56''</sup>\n#Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 for all the applicants (other than Carson) should be declared inadmissible since they had not brought proceedings before the UK courts.\n#Since Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 had not been tested in the UK courts, it should be declared inadmissible to this Court.\n\n===== C. The Court's Assessment =====\n\n*The Court maintained that, under UK domestic law, under Article 1 Protocol No. 1, the applicants do not have a right to receive the annual uprating. This had been dismissed by the ECHR Fourth Section and cannot be appealed.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 57''</sup> \n*The Court did not accept the UK Government's objections to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the 12 applicants that had not filed domestic proceedings in the UK, and given that Carson had failed in that regard, there was no point in them litigating in the UK.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 58''</sup>\n*The Court declared that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 should be inadmissible, because this had not been tested in the UK domestic courts.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 59 and 60''</sup>\n\n==== 2. Alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in Conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ====\n\n===== A. The Court's general approach =====\n\n*The Court then re-reviewed Case law that had been raised in the ECHR Fourth Section, and they accepted that the UK Government was better placed to understand ''\"..what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds\".''<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 61''</sup>\n*The Court discounted the hardship that \"freezing\" the UK state pension had on the applicants, and thousands like them, since ''\"any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorizations to distinguish between different groups in need.\"''. The question before the court was whether different groups of UK pensioners were in similar situations such that one group was discriminated against over the other.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 63''</sup>\n\n===== B. Whether the facts underlying the complaint fall within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 =====\n\n*Article 14 by itself has no meaning in law, since it is an anti-discrimination law, without identifying who or what is being discriminated against, so, in order to be used the applicants case must be ''\"within scope\"'' of one or more of the underlying Article(s).<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 63''</sup>\n*The ECHR Fourth Section had found that the applicants case was with the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 64''</sup>\n*The Court agrees with this assessment, and there was no argument relating to this from the UK Government.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 65''</sup>\n\n===== C. Whether \"country of residence\" falls within the phrase \"or other status\" in Article 14 =====\n\n====== 1. The ECHG Fourth Section's conclusions ======\n\n*The Lower Chamber had agreed that ''\"country of residence\"'' fell within scope of Article 14.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 66''</sup>\n\n====== 2. The parties' submissions ======\n\n*The applicants maintained that the treating of ''residence'' was an aspect of ''personal status'' and was consistent with Case law. In addition, their position is that whilst moving abroad is a question of ''\"free choice\"'' it is not so if it is driven by the need or desire to be close to family members.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 67''</sup>\n*The Government had conceded in the UK domestic courts that Carson's ''\"foreign residence''\" was protected under Article 14, but argued that moving abroad was a matter of choice.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 68''</sup>\n*The third party, [[Age Concern]] and [[Help the Aged]], emphasized the importance of family support in old age.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 69''</sup>\n\n====== 3. The Court's Assessment ======\n\n*Based on Case law, the Court (Grand Chamber) supported the decision by the ECHR Fourth Section - ''\"place of residence\"'' is an aspect of ''\"personal status\"''.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 70 & 71''</sup>\n\n===== D. Whether the applicants are in a relatively similar position to pensioners receiving uprating =====\n\n====== 1. The ECHR Fourth Section Chamber's conclusions ======\n\n*There are three cohort of UK pensioners. Those that live:\n:a). in the UK;\n:b). abroad, but live in a country that has a reciprocal agreement with the UK; and\n:c). abroad, but live in a country that does not have a reciprocal agreement with the UK.\n*The UK's social welfare and pension system was primarily for UK pensioners living in the UK. The Chambers did not believe that the pensioners in the second and third categories could be compared against each other.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 72''</sup>\n\n====== 2. The parties' submissions ======\n\n:a. The Applicants\n\n::1. The applicants argued that there was no difference between the pensioner in groups b. and c. above, and therefore they should be treated the same, regarding the annual state pension increase.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 73''</sup>\n::2. They agreed with the dissenting opinions expressed by [[User:The Retiree/sandbox/R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions 3|Lord Carswell (House of Lords Appeal)]], and by [[User:The Retiree/sandbox/R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions 4|Judge Garlicki, President, ECHR Fourth Section]], namely:<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 74 & 75''</sup>\n:::i).   UK Pensioners will have spent major parts of their life working in the UK, and all would have made the same [[National Insurance Contributions]], regardless of which of the three groups above they were in;\n:::ii).  UK Pensioners will have become entitled to the same UK state pension, again, regardless of which of the three groups above they were in;\n:::iii). The UK state pension was a contributory system, and that the UK Government themselves had made it available to pensioners living abroad;\n:::iv).  Regardless of ''\"country of residence\"'', all UK pensioners would want to maintain the same standard of living. There was no empirical evidence to support differences in social economic conditions in countries where uprating was paid and in those countries where it wasn't.  \n::3. The Court should not put too much emphasis on the [[Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952|1952 International Labour Organisation Convention]], since this focused on social security systems in general, and not specifically related to contributory pensions in particular.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 76''</sup>\n::4. Under UK domestic law, the existence of reciprocal arrangements was not a requirement for the UK state pension to be increased. In addition, there was no pattern between those countries where reciprocal arrangements with the UK existed, and those countries where they didn't.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 77''</sup> \n::5. Once the UK Government had decided that all pensioners should receive a UK state pension (regardless of which country they lived in), then it was irrational not to pay the same amount to everyone on an on-going basis.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 78''</sup>\n\n:b. The Government\n\n::1. The Government set out what previous courts had decided - the UK social security and taxation system is designed for the benefit of residents of the UK. They also argued that there were distinct differences between those pensioners living abroad that received the annual increase versus those that don't.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 79''</sup>\n::2. There was no practical way in which the factors that influence the annual increase - inflation, economic growth, and fluctuations in exchange rates - could be compared (or aligned) between countries.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 80''</sup>\n::3. The Government argued that National Insurance Contributions paid into the National Insurance Fund cannot be equated to contributions to an occupational or private pension. There are no guaranteed entitlements.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 81''</sup>\n::4. Pensioners living abroad fall into two groups - those that live in countries where social security bilateral agreements with the UK have been negotiated (in which case, the UK pensioners receive the annual increase) and those that live in countries that do not have social security bilateral agreements with the UK (in which case, the UK pensioners do not receive the annual increase). The Government argued that these are two different groups of UK pensioners, and they were well with their rights to treat them differently. If they were to be treated the same, then this would ''\"negate the power to enter into bilateral treaties of this kind\"''.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 82''</sup>\n\n====== 3. The Courts Assessment ======\n\n*The applicants believed that they were in the same position as those UK pensioners that lived abroad and received the annual increase. ''\"National Insurance Contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions\"''. They form part of the revenue which is used to pay a number of social security benefits, and because of this, the two different groups of UK pensioners living outside the UK can be regarded as the same. National Insurance Contributions go towards maintaining a minimum standard of living for residents of the UK.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 84 and 85''</sup>\n*UK pensioners living outside the UK cannot be compared with those living in the UK due to ''\"differing economic and social conditions\"''.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 86''</sup>\n*The Court did not believe that the two groups of UK pensioners living abroad (those countries that have bilateral agreements, and those that don't) can be regarded as the same.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 87-90''</sup>\n\n=== The Court ===\n\n#Agreed unanimously that the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 inadmissible;\n#Rejected unanimously the UK Government's preliminary objection concerning the admissibility of the complaints of the applicants, other than Carson herself; \n#Agreed, by eleven votes to six that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe six dissenting judges agreed that:\n\n#Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No 1 had been violated;\n#Article 14 on its own had been violated;\n#All of the applicants were in the same boat even though their countries of residence may be different;\n#The majority approach regarding \"residence\" seemed self contradictory, and inconsistent with the spirit of Article 14;\n#The conclusion of the majority, regarding the characteristics of UK pensioners living in the UK and those living in \"frozen\" countries was wrong because, other than country of residence, there is no difference between the two pensioner cohorts - they all paid into the same system; all of them are entitled to a UK State Pension which is based on the number of Contributing years;\n#The majority of the judges decided that even though both cohorts of UK pensioners (those that received the annual State Pension uprating and those that didn't) had made equal contributions to the National Insurance system that does not mean that they can be treated the same. The majority argued that the State pension has multiple sources, but those dissenting could not see the relevance of that and because both cohorts of pensioners paid into the system, they should all be treated the same. The right to a State Pension, and the right to be treated the same is based on the rules by which a pensioner receives a State Pension;\n#All pensioners living abroad (whether or not they received the annual increase) had a common characteristic - their buying power was decreased every year based on the drop in currency exchange rates;\n#Those pensioners who lived in the UK received inflationary increases every year. Those pensioners living abroad who received the increase, received the same increase as those in the UK regardless of the increase of the inflationary rate in their own country. For those countries that had higher inflationary rates, then UK pensioners living in those countries would find their UK State Pension depreciating compared to those pensioners living in the UK. Those pensioners living in countries like South Africa, who did not receive annual increases found that their UK State Pension was depreciating at an even faster rate. In Carson's case this was significant. In the period 2000-2005 she found that her weekly UK State Pension had fallen by 28%. Comparing this to a pensioner living in the UK, the comparative loss increased further with time;\n#Given the two cohorts of pensioners - those that received annual increases, and those that did not - the dissenting judges could see no relevant differences between the two cohorts that justified such a radical difference in the UK State Pension received. In addition, they were not persuaded by the UK Government to decide otherwise and that their argument went against the spirit of Article 14 of the Convention;\n#Whilst the UK State Pension system is designed to ensure that the financial needs of pensioners living in the UK are taken into account, the dissenting judges could see no justification for treating them unfavorably and unequally. There will always be differences in the increases in inflation for each country and the impact that this has on the buying power of the State Pension. The fall in the sterling exchange rate has been consistent for over a century, and the impact that this has on UK pensioners living overseas in \"frozen\" countries can cause irreparable deterioration in the real value of the State Pension. The complete denial of any increases represents a disproportionate difference which cannot be justified;\n#UK pensioners living overseas do not receive health benefits, such as the [[National Health Service]], and nor do they pay UK taxes - this is no reason as to why they should not receive the annual increase, since, UK taxes forgone are less than the housing, healthcare and social welfare benefits which are payable to pensioners living in the UK but not those who live abroad.\n\nThe UK Government prevailed; Carson and the other Applicants lost their appeal and they had run out of Courts to appeal to.<ref>{{cite news |title=UK expats lose pension freeze appeal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8568970.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=16 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Adam |title=European Court rejects UK pensioners\u2019 top-up claim |url=https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/03/28/european-court-rejects-uk-pensioners-top-up-claim/ |website=UK Human Rights Blog |date=28 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Citations ==\n\n''Burden v.

There were agreements with Australia (1953), New Zealand (1956) and Canada (1959) but these did not require payment of up-rated pensions.

Admissibility Issues ====\n\n===== A. The Chamber's Conclusions =====\n\n*The ECHR Fourth Section had previously decided that the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken alone was inadmissible. It also decided that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 was admissible, and that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 did not need to be examined.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 53''</sup>\n\n===== B. The parties' submissions =====\n\n*Article 1 of Protocol No. 1:<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 54''</sup>\n#The adding of \"country of residence\" in determining whether a UK pensioner should receive the annual state pension increase involved a ''\"deprivation or interference\"'' with the right to receiving the annual increase;\n#The ''\"possession\"'' that UK pensioners have (in the state pension they receive) was being eroded every year for which they did not receive the annual increase. \nThe applicants argued that the ECHR Fourth section had only dealt with the first of the two complaints above.\n*Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 had not been heard in UK court proceedings brought by Carson (alone), and therefore should not have been dismissed so lightly in the ECHR Fourth Section.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 55''</sup>\n*The Government said that:<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 56''</sup>\n#Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 for all the applicants (other than Carson) should be declared inadmissible since they had not brought proceedings before the UK courts.\n#Since Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 had not been tested in the UK courts, it should be declared inadmissible to this Court.\n\n===== C. The Court's Assessment =====\n\n*The Court maintained that, under UK domestic law, under Article 1 Protocol No. 1, the applicants do not have a right to receive the annual uprating. This had been dismissed by the ECHR Fourth Section and cannot be appealed.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 57''</sup> \n*The Court did not accept the UK Government's objections to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the 12 applicants that had not filed domestic proceedings in the UK, and given that Carson had failed in that regard, there was no point in them litigating in the UK.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 58''</sup>\n*The Court declared that Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 should be inadmissible, because this had not been tested in the UK domestic courts.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 59 and 60''</sup>\n\n==== 2. Alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in Conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ====\n\n===== A. The Court's general approach =====\n\n*The Court then re-reviewed Case law that had been raised in the ECHR Fourth Section, and they accepted that the UK Government was better placed to understand ''\"..what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds\".''<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 61''</sup>\n*The Court discounted the hardship that \"freezing\" the UK state pension had on the applicants, and thousands like them, since ''\"any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorizations to distinguish between different groups in need.\"''. The question before the court was whether different groups of UK pensioners were in similar situations such that one group was discriminated against over the other.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 63''</sup>\n\n===== B. Whether the facts underlying the complaint fall within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 =====\n\n*Article 14 by itself has no meaning in law, since it is an anti-discrimination law, without identifying who or what is being discriminated against, so, in order to be used the applicants case must be ''\"within scope\"'' of one or more of the underlying Article(s).<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 63''</sup>\n*The ECHR Fourth Section had found that the applicants case was with the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 64''</sup>\n*The Court agrees with this assessment, and there was no argument relating to this from the UK Government.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 65''</sup>\n\n===== C. Whether \"country of residence\" falls within the phrase \"or other status\" in Article 14 =====\n\n====== 1. The ECHG Fourth Section's conclusions ======\n\n*The Lower Chamber had agreed that ''\"country of residence\"'' fell within scope of Article 14.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 66''</sup>\n\n====== 2. The parties' submissions ======\n\n*The applicants maintained that the treating of ''residence'' was an aspect of ''personal status'' and was consistent with Case law. In addition, their position is that whilst moving abroad is a question of ''\"free choice\"'' it is not so if it is driven by the need or desire to be close to family members.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 67''</sup>\n*The Government had conceded in the UK domestic courts that Carson's ''\"foreign residence''\" was protected under Article 14, but argued that moving abroad was a matter of choice.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 68''</sup>\n*The third party, [[Age Concern]] and [[Help the Aged]], emphasized the importance of family support in old age.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 69''</sup>\n\n====== 3. The Court's Assessment ======\n\n*Based on Case law, the Court (Grand Chamber) supported the decision by the ECHR Fourth Section - ''\"place of residence\"'' is an aspect of ''\"personal status\"''.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 70 & 71''</sup>\n\n===== D. Whether the applicants are in a relatively similar position to pensioners receiving uprating =====\n\n====== 1. The ECHR Fourth Section Chamber's conclusions ======\n\n*There are three cohort of UK pensioners. Those that live:\n:a). in the UK;\n:b). abroad, but live in a country that has a reciprocal agreement with the UK; and\n:c). abroad, but live in a country that does not have a reciprocal agreement with the UK.\n*The UK's social welfare and pension system was primarily for UK pensioners living in the UK. The Chambers did not believe that the pensioners in the second and third categories could be compared against each other.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 72''</sup>\n\n====== 2. The parties' submissions ======\n\n:a. The Applicants\n\n::1. The applicants argued that there was no difference between the pensioner in groups b. and c. above, and therefore they should be treated the same, regarding the annual state pension increase.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 73''</sup>\n::2. They agreed with the dissenting opinions expressed by [[User:The Retiree/sandbox/R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions 3|Lord Carswell (House of Lords Appeal)]], and by [[User:The Retiree/sandbox/R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions 4|Judge Garlicki, President, ECHR Fourth Section]], namely:<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 74 & 75''</sup>\n:::i).   UK Pensioners will have spent major parts of their life working in the UK, and all would have made the same [[National Insurance Contributions]], regardless of which of the three groups above they were in;\n:::ii).  UK Pensioners will have become entitled to the same UK state pension, again, regardless of which of the three groups above they were in;\n:::iii). The UK state pension was a contributory system, and that the UK Government themselves had made it available to pensioners living abroad;\n:::iv).  Regardless of ''\"country of residence\"'', all UK pensioners would want to maintain the same standard of living. There was no empirical evidence to support differences in social economic conditions in countries where uprating was paid and in those countries where it wasn't.  \n::3. The Court should not put too much emphasis on the [[Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952|1952 International Labour Organisation Convention]], since this focused on social security systems in general, and not specifically related to contributory pensions in particular.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 76''</sup>\n::4. Under UK domestic law, the existence of reciprocal arrangements was not a requirement for the UK state pension to be increased. In addition, there was no pattern between those countries where reciprocal arrangements with the UK existed, and those countries where they didn't.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 77''</sup> \n::5. Once the UK Government had decided that all pensioners should receive a UK state pension (regardless of which country they lived in), then it was irrational not to pay the same amount to everyone on an on-going basis.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 78''</sup>\n\n:b. The Government\n\n::1. The Government set out what previous courts had decided - the UK social security and taxation system is designed for the benefit of residents of the UK. They also argued that there were distinct differences between those pensioners living abroad that received the annual increase versus those that don't.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 79''</sup>\n::2. There was no practical way in which the factors that influence the annual increase - inflation, economic growth, and fluctuations in exchange rates - could be compared (or aligned) between countries.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 80''</sup>\n::3. The Government argued that National Insurance Contributions paid into the National Insurance Fund cannot be equated to contributions to an occupational or private pension. There are no guaranteed entitlements.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 81''</sup>\n::4. Pensioners living abroad fall into two groups - those that live in countries where social security bilateral agreements with the UK have been negotiated (in which case, the UK pensioners receive the annual increase) and those that live in countries that do not have social security bilateral agreements with the UK (in which case, the UK pensioners do not receive the annual increase). The Government argued that these are two different groups of UK pensioners, and they were well with their rights to treat them differently. If they were to be treated the same, then this would ''\"negate the power to enter into bilateral treaties of this kind\"''.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 82''</sup>\n\n====== 3. The Courts Assessment ======\n\n*The applicants believed that they were in the same position as those UK pensioners that lived abroad and received the annual increase. ''\"National Insurance Contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions\"''. They form part of the revenue which is used to pay a number of social security benefits, and because of this, the two different groups of UK pensioners living outside the UK can be regarded as the same. National Insurance Contributions go towards maintaining a minimum standard of living for residents of the UK.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 84 and 85''</sup>\n*UK pensioners living outside the UK cannot be compared with those living in the UK due to ''\"differing economic and social conditions\"''.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''para 86''</sup>\n*The Court did not believe that the two groups of UK pensioners living abroad (those countries that have bilateral agreements, and those that don't) can be regarded as the same.<ref name=\"ECHR 2\" /> <sup>''paras 87-90''</sup>\n\n=== The Court ===\n\n#Agreed unanimously that the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 inadmissible;\n#Rejected unanimously the UK Government's preliminary objection concerning the admissibility of the complaints of the applicants, other than Carson herself; \n#Agreed, by eleven votes to six that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe six dissenting judges agreed that:\n\n#Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No 1 had been violated;\n#Article 14 on its own had been violated;\n#All of the applicants were in the same boat even though their countries of residence may be different;\n#The majority approach regarding \"residence\" seemed self contradictory, and inconsistent with the spirit of Article 14;\n#The conclusion of the majority, regarding the characteristics of UK pensioners living in the UK and those living in \"frozen\" countries was wrong because, other than country of residence, there is no difference between the two pensioner cohorts - they all paid into the same system; all of them are entitled to a UK State Pension which is based on the number of Contributing years;\n#The majority of the judges decided that even though both cohorts of UK pensioners (those that received the annual State Pension uprating and those that didn't) had made equal contributions to the National Insurance system that does not mean that they can be treated the same. The majority argued that the State pension has multiple sources, but those dissenting could not see the relevance of that and because both cohorts of pensioners paid into the system, they should all be treated the same. The right to a State Pension, and the right to be treated the same is based on the rules by which a pensioner receives a State Pension;\n#All pensioners living abroad (whether or not they received the annual increase) had a common characteristic - their buying power was decreased every year based on the drop in currency exchange rates;\n#Those pensioners who lived in the UK received inflationary increases every year. Those pensioners living abroad who received the increase, received the same increase as those in the UK regardless of the increase of the inflationary rate in their own country. For those countries that had higher inflationary rates, then UK pensioners living in those countries would find their UK State Pension depreciating compared to those pensioners living in the UK. Those pensioners living in countries like South Africa, who did not receive annual increases found that their UK State Pension was depreciating at an even faster rate. In Carson's case this was significant. In the period 2000-2005 she found that her weekly UK State Pension had fallen by 28%. Comparing this to a pensioner living in the UK, the comparative loss increased further with time;\n#Given the two cohorts of pensioners - those that received annual increases, and those that did not - the dissenting judges could see no relevant differences between the two cohorts that justified such a radical difference in the UK State Pension received. In addition, they were not persuaded by the UK Government to decide otherwise and that their argument went against the spirit of Article 14 of the Convention;\n#Whilst the UK State Pension system is designed to ensure that the financial needs of pensioners living in the UK are taken into account, the dissenting judges could see no justification for treating them unfavourably and unequally. There will always be differences in the increases in inflation for each country and the impact that this has on the buying power of the State Pension. The fall in the sterling exchange rate has been consistent for over a century, and the impact that this has on UK pensioners living overseas in \"frozen\" countries can cause irreparable deterioration in the real value of the State Pension. The complete denial of any increases represents a disproportionate difference which cannot be justified;\n#UK pensioners living overseas do not receive health benefits, such as the [[National Health Service]], and nor do they pay UK taxes - this is no reason as to why they should not receive the annual increase, since, UK taxes forgone are less than the housing, healthcare and social welfare benefits which are payable to pensioners living in the UK but not those who live abroad.\n\nThe UK Government prevailed; Carson and the other Applicants lost their appeal and they had run out of Courts to appeal to.<ref>{{cite news |title=UK expats lose pension freeze appeal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8568970.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=16 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Adam |title=European Court rejects UK pensioners\u2019 top-up claim |url=https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/03/28/european-court-rejects-uk-pensioners-top-up-claim/ |website=UK Human Rights Blog |date=28 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Citations ==\n\n''Burden v.

A computer [[Hydrological model|model of the hydraulic basin]] and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n== Social and environmental impact of dams ==\nLarge dams can ruin river ecosystems, cover large areas of land causing green house gas emissions from underwater rotting vegetation and displace thousands of people and affect their livelihood.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46098118 Large hydropower dams 'not sustainable' in the developing world] BBC, 2018</ref><ref>Moran, Emilio F. et al [https://www.pnas.org/content/115/47/11891 Sustainable hydropower in the 21st century] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 115.47 (2018): 11891-11898.

In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=633|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Hydroelectricity===\n{{Main|Hydroelectricity}}\nHydroelectricity is the application of hydropower to generate electricity.\nIt is the primary use of hydropower today.\n[[Hydroelectric power plant]]s can include a [[reservoir]] (generally created by a [[dam]]) to exploit the energy of falling water, or can use the [[kinetic energy]] of water as in [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]].\nHydroelectric plants can vary in size from small community sized plants ([[micro hydro]]) to very large plants supplying power to a whole country.\nAs of 2019, the [[List of largest power stations|five largest power stations in the world]] are conventional hydroelectric power stations with dams.\n\nHydroelectricity can also be used to store energy in the form of [[potential energy]] between two reservoirs at different heights with [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]].\nWater is pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.\n\nOther forms of electricity generation with hydropower include [[tidal stream generator]]s using energy from [[tidal power]] generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.british-hydro.org/tidal-range-off-shore/ | title=Tidal Range & off Shore}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Hydroelectric dam.svg|A [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|conventional]] dammed-hydro facility (hydroelectric dam) is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation.\nFile:Chief Joseph Dam.jpg|[[Chief Joseph Dam]] near [[Bridgeport, Washington]], is a major [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river station]] without a sizeable reservoir.\nFile:Nw vietnam hydro.jpg|[[Micro hydro]] in Northwest Vietnam\nFile:Stwlan.dam.jpg|The upper reservoir and dam of the [[Ffestiniog Power Station|Ffestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme]] in [[Wales]].
