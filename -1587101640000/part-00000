Once widespread across Northumberland, Tyneside and northern County Durham, this feature is now largely confined to older residents in rural areas in Northumberland and northern County Durham.\n*Verbs ending in [t] are often rhotacised, becoming [\u0279]/[\u0280], especially if the following word begins with a vowel. Therefore, the phrase \"get away\" becomes \"gerr away\" in Northumbrian.\n*Words ending in [\u014b] (like in the gerund \"-ing\") are often pronounced as [n], and so the word \"shopping\" becomes ''shoppin'' or \"walking\" becomes ''waakin'' \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

Lateral\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | l\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n===Vowels===\n*The vowel [\u025c\u02d0] typically becomes [\u0254\u02d0] ,and so ''work'' would rhyme with ''fork'' in Northumbrian. For instance, ''certainly'' becomes ''sortainly'' [s\u0254\u02d0tn\u0329li]  and ''surge'' becomes ''sorge'' [s\u0254\u02d0d\u0361\u0292] etc.\n*The letter \"i\" in words like ''find'', ''blind'' or ''pint'' is pronounced as [\u026a], as opposed to [a\u026a], and so \"''find\"'' would rhyme with ''wind'' (noun) or ''stint.''\n*The vowel sound [\u0254\u02d0] as in ''call'' corresponds to [a\u02d0] (represented by aa). And so ''call'', ''walk'' and ''talk'' are ''caal'', ''waak'' and ''taak'' in Northumbrian.\n**This creates some minimal pairs based upon phonemic vowel length, such as ''te tak'' /tak/ (\"to take\" in some dialects, such as those of Wearside) vs. te taak /ta\u02d0k/\n*The diphthong [a\u028a\u032f] in words such as down and town corresponds to the long vowel [u\u02d0] (written as \"oo\"), therefore ''down'' and ''town'' are  \"doon\" and \"toon\" in Northumbrian. However, it is shortened to [\u028a] when followed by [nd], so \"pound\" and \"found\" are \"pund\" and \"fund\".\n*The diphthong [e\u026a] often corresponds to [j\u025b] in dialectal Northumbrian speech, such as ''te tyek'' (to take) and ''fyess'' (face), but may also correspond to [(j)a] in some Northumbrian dialects such as ''te tak'' or ''fyass''.\n*Long vowel [u\u02d0]  in words such as ''book'' and ''cook'' typically corresponds to other sounds, such as [j\u0289\u02d0] or [\u0289.\u0259], as in the word ''skeul'' (school).\n*Lack of [[Phonological_history_of_English_close_back_vowels#Foot\u2013strut_split|foot-strut split]], as in other Northern English varieties.\n*Words with the [[Received Pronunciation]] diphthong [\u0259\u028a] usually corresponds to [j\u025b] in some words in traditional Northumbrian dialect, such as ''byeth'' and ''hyem'' for \"both\" and \"home\". However, older forms such as ''baith'' and ''hame'', which are shared with Scots, survive in some Northumbrian dialects.<ref>[[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]]: ''A Dictionary of North East Dialect'', 2004, Northumbria University Press, {{ISBN|1-904794-16-5}}, p.&nbsp;79</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Monophthongs of Northumbrian (Tyneside)\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | Front\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Central\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Back\n|- class=\"small\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | unrounded\n! rowspan=\"2\" | rounded\n|- class=\"small\"\n! short\n! long\n! short\n! long\n|-\n!

The local speech has characteristics of the rural Northumberland dialect and due to its geographical location, has characteristics of the East Central Scots dialect as well.<ref>[http://www.visitberwick.com/what-are-we]</ref>\n\nThis Dialect has several distinguishing features from the Geordie dialect and features of this dialect include the \"Northumbrian burr\", a distinct pronunciation of the letter R and elongation of vowels although this feature is not just specific to Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\nA sociological study of the Anglo-Scottish border region conducted in the year 2000 found that locals of Alnwick, 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) south of Berwick, associated the Berwick accent with Scottish influence. Conversely, those from Eyemouth, Scotland, 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) north of Berwick, firmly classed Berwick speech as English, identifying it as Northumbrian.\n\n==Classification in relation to English and Scots==\nThe Northumbrian Language Society, founded in 1983 to research, preserve and promote the Northumbrian language variety, considers it as divergent enough to be not a dialect of [[Modern English|Modern Standard English]] but, rather, a [[Anglic languages|separate English (Anglic) language]] of its own, since it is largely not comprehensible by standard English speakers.<ref name=NLS/> Northumbrian has perhaps an even closer relationship with the [[Scots language]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/geordie.html |title=Newcastle English (Geordie) |publisher=Hawaii.edu |date=2000-05-06 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref> and both are sometimes considered as distinct [[Anglic languages|languages derived from Old English]] but close relatives,<ref name=NLS/> or as essentially the same language, albeit with minor differences; however, this similarity is not commonly or formally recognised due to sensitivities on both side of the border.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riley |title=Geordie and Northumbria Dialect: Resource Book for North East English Dialect |publisher=CreateSpace |pages=10}}</ref> The status of Scots and Northumbrian as either languages or dialects therefore continues to be open to debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://badlinguistics.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/can-scots-be-english/ |title=Can Scots be English? - BadLinguistics |publisher=Badlinguistics.posterous.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n===Nouns===\nNorthumbrian includes some strong plurals such as ''ee''/''een'' (eye/eyes), ''hoose''/''hoosen'' (house/houses), ''pee''/''pesen'' (pea/peas), ''coo''/''kye'' (cow/cows) and ''shough''/''shoon'' (shoe/shoes) that survived from Old English into Northumbrian but have become weak plurals in Standard Modern English \u2013 ox/oxen and child/children being exceptions. Regular Northumbrian plurals which correspond to irregular in Standard English include ''loafs'' (loaves), ''wifes'' (wives) and ''shelfs'' (shelves)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ridley |first1=Brendan |title=Geordie and Northumbria Dialect: Resource book for North East English dialect |date=2016 |pages=81}}</ref>\n===Pronouns===\nNorthumbrian uses the singular second-person pronouns ''thoo'' and ''thee''.

Once widespread across Northumberland, Tyneside and northern County Durham, this feature is now largely confined to older residents in rural areas in Northumberland and northern County Durham.\n*Verbs ending in [t] are often rhotacised, becoming [\u0279]/[\u0280], especially if the following word begins with a vowel. Therefore, the phrase \"get away\" becomes \"gerr away\" in Northumbrian.\n*Words ending in [\u014b] (like in the gerund \"-ing\") are often pronounced as [n], and so the word \"shopping\" becomes ''shoppin'' or \"walking\" becomes ''waakin'' \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

For instance, ''certainly'' becomes ''sortainly'' [s\u0254\u02d0tn\u0329li]  and ''surge'' becomes ''sorge'' [s\u0254\u02d0d\u0361\u0292] etc.\n*The letter \"i\" in words like ''find'', ''blind'' or ''pint'' is pronounced as [\u026a], as opposed to [a\u026a], and so would rhyme with ''wind'' (noun) or ''stint'' \n*The vowel sound [\u0254\u02d0] as in ''call'' corresponds [a\u02d0] (represented by aa). And so ''call'', ''walk'' and ''talk'' are ''caal'', ''waak'' and ''taak'' in Northumbrian.\n**This creates some minimal pairs based upon phonemic vowel length, such as ''te tak'' /tak/ (\"to take\" in some dialects, such as those of wearside Wearside) vs. te taak /ta\u02d0k/\n*The diphthong [a\u028a\u032f] in words such as down and town corresponds to the long vowel [u\u02d0] (written as \"oo\"), therefore ''down'' and ''town'' are  \"doon\" and \"toon\" in Northumbrian. However, it is shortened to [\u028a] when followed by [nd], so \"pound\" and \"found\" are \"pund\" and \"fund\".\n*The diphthong [e\u026a] often corresponds to [j\u025b] in dialectal Northumbrian speech, such as ''te tyek'' (to take) and ''fyess'' (face), but may also correspond to [(j)a] in some Northumbrian dialects such as ''te tak'' or ''fyass''.\n*Long vowel [u\u02d0] or in words such as ''book'' and ''cook'' typucally corresponds to other sounds, such as [j\u0289\u02d0] or [\u0289.\u0259], as in the word ''skeul'' (school).\n*Lack of [[Phonological_history_of_English_close_back_vowels#Foot\u2013strut_split|foot-strut split]], as in other Northern English varieties.\n*Words with the [[Received Pronunciation]] diphthong [\u0259\u028a] usually corresponds to [j\u025b] in some words in traditional Northumbrian dialect, such as ''byeth'' and ''hyem'' for \"both\" and \"home\". However, older forms such as ''baith'' and ''hame'', which are shared with Scots, survive in some Northumbrian dialects.<ref>[[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]]: ''A Dictionary of North East Dialect'', 2004, Northumbria University Press, {{ISBN|1-904794-16-5}}, p.&nbsp;79</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Monophthongs of Northumbrian (Tyneside)\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | Front\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Central\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Back\n|- class=\"small\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | unrounded\n! rowspan=\"2\" | rounded\n|- class=\"small\"\n! short\n! long\n! short\n! long\n|-\n!

The local speech has characteristics of the rural Northumberland dialect and due to its geographical location, has characteristics of the East Central Scots dialect as well.<ref>[http://www.visitberwick.com/what-are-we]</ref>\n\nThis Dialect has several distinguishing features from the Geordie dialect and features of this dialect include the \"Northumbrian burr\", a distinct pronunciation of the letter R and elongation of vowels although this feature is not just specific to Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\nA sociological study of the Anglo-Scottish border region conducted in the year 2000 found that locals of Alnwick, 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) south of Berwick, associated the Berwick accent with Scottish influence. Conversely, those from Eyemouth, Scotland, 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) north of Berwick, firmly classed Berwick speech as English, identifying it as Northumbrian.\n\n==Classification in relation to English and Scots==\nThe Northumbrian Language Society, founded in 1983 to research, preserve and promote the Northumbrian language variety, considers it as divergent enough to be not a dialect of [[Modern English|Modern Standard English]] but, rather, a [[Anglic languages|separate English (Anglic) language]] of its own, since it is largely not comprehensible by standard English speakers.<ref name=NLS/> Northumbrian has perhaps an even closer relationship with the [[Scots language]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/geordie.html |title=Newcastle English (Geordie) |publisher=Hawaii.edu |date=2000-05-06 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref> and both are sometimes considered as distinct [[Anglic languages|languages derived from Old English]] but close relatives,<ref name=NLS/> or as essentially the same language, albeit with minor differences; however, this similarity is not commonly or formally recognised due to sensitivities on both side of the border.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riley |title=Geordie and Northumbria Dialect: Resource Book for North East English Dialect |publisher=CreateSpace |pages=10}}</ref> The status of Scots and Northumbrian as either languages or dialects therefore continues to be open to debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://badlinguistics.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/can-scots-be-english/ |title=Can Scots be English? - BadLinguistics |publisher=Badlinguistics.posterous.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n===Nouns===\nNorthumbrian includes some strong plurals such as ''ee''/''een'' (eye/eyes), ''hoose''/''hoosen'' (house/houses), ''pee''/''pesen'' (pea/peas), ''coo''/''kye'' (cow/cows) and ''shough''/''shoon'' (shoe/shoes) that survived from Old English into Northumbrian but have become weak plurals in Standard Modern English \u2013 ox/oxen and child/children being exceptions.

After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on [[horoscope]]s, [[Graphology|graphological]] analyses, and the like.

For example, hucksters are more likely to be successful if they exude an air of confidence (\"If you look and act as if you believe in what you are doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects\"), if they \"[m]ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys\" showing \"what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on\", if they employ \"a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading\", if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their \"clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech\", if they are not afraid of \"hamming it up\", and if they use flattery.<ref name=\"Psychology Today\"/>\n\n[[Michael H.

Because the assessment statements are so vague, people interpret their own meaning, thus the statement becomes \"personal\" to them. Also, individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the person presenting the assessment as a high-status professional.\n\nThe term \"Barnum effect\" was coined in 1956 by psychologist [[Paul Meehl]] in his essay ''Wanted \u2013 A Good Cookbook'', because he relates the vague personality descriptions used in certain \"pseudo-successful\" psychological tests to those given by showman [[P.

After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on [[horoscope]]s, [[Graphology|graphological]] analyses, and the like. Each of the managers was then asked how accurate the assessment of him or her was.

Those in the third group were most likely to say that their \"horoscopes\" applied to them; those in the first group were least likely to do so.<ref name=\"Denis Dutton\"/>\n\n==Exploiting the effect==\n{{see also|Cold reading}}\nIn 1977, [[Ray Hyman]] wrote about the way in which palm readers and other such [[huckster]]s exploit the Forer effect to take advantage of victims (or 'marks'). He provided a list of factors that help these tricksters to dupe their prey. For example, hucksters are more likely to be successful if they exude an air of confidence (\"If you look and act as if you believe in what you are doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects\"), if they \"[m]ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys\" showing \"what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on\", if they employ \"a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading\", if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their \"clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech\", if they are not afraid of \"hamming it up\", and if they use flattery.<ref name=\"Psychology Today\"/>\n\n[[Michael H.

An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as '''[[vaudeville]] blues'''. Classic blues were performed by singers accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles and were the first blues to be recorded. [[Ma Rainey]], [[Bessie Smith]], [[Ethel Waters]], and the other singers in this genre were instrumental in spreading the popularity of the blues.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nBlues, a type of black folk music originating in the American South, were mainly in the form of work songs until about 1900.<ref name=\"Fabre100\">Fabre and Feith 2001, p. 100.</ref> [[Ma Rainey|Gertrude \u201cMa\u201d Rainey]] (1886\u20131939), known as \"The Mother of the Blues\u201d, is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and comedy around 1902.<ref>Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 38,</ref><ref>Harrison 1988, p. 34.</ref> Rainey had heard a woman singing about the man she had lost, learned the song, and began using it as her closing number, calling it \u201cthe blues\".

Most toured through a circuit established by the black-owned [[Theatre Owners Booking Association]] ([[T.O.B.A.]]) on the East Coast and through the South as far west as Oklahoma.\n\nA key figure in popularizing the blues was the composer [[W. C. Handy]], who published the first of his blues songs in 1912.<ref>Randell 2003, p. 104.</ref> His compositions, notably \"[[The Memphis Blues]]\" and \"[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]\", quickly became standards for blues singers.

Bradford's persistence led the General Phonograph Company to record the New York cabaret singer [[Mamie Smith]] in its [[Okeh]] studio on February 14, 1920.

Singers like [[Lil Johnson (blues singer)|Lil Johnson]], [[Memphis Minnie]] and [[Lucille Bogan]] started recording for the [[American Record Corporation|ARC]] group of cheaper labels and for [[Decca Records]] (after late 1934). Other 1920s female blues singers who later made swing blues records include Victoria Spivey, Ida Cox, and [[Bertha Hill|Bertha \"Chippie\" Hill]].\n\nIn the 1960s a revival of interest in the blues brought Sippie Wallace, [[Alberta Hunter]], Edith Wilson and Victoria Spivey back to the concert stage. In 1961 Spivey started her own [[record label]], Spivey Records.

The present city of Richmond was founded in 1737. It became the capital of the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1780, replacing [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. During the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] period, several notable events occurred in the city, including [[Patrick Henry]]'s \"[[Give me liberty or give me death]]\" speech in 1775 at [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)|St. John's Church]], and the passage of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] written by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Richmond was the capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. It entered the 20th century with one of the world's first successful electric [[streetcar]] systems. The [[Jackson Ward]] neighborhood is a traditional hub of [[African-American]] commerce and culture.\n\nRichmond's economy is primarily driven by law, finance, and government, with federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as notable legal and banking firms in the [[Downtown Richmond, Virginia|downtown area]].

To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed [[James River bateau]]x above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, [[George Washington]] helped design the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] from [[Westham, Virginia|Westham]] east to Richmond, to bypass Richmond's rapids on the upper James River with the intent of providing a water route across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Kanawha River]] flowing westward into the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] then eventually to the [[Mississippi River]]. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to [[hydropower]] due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the country's largest manufacturing facilities, including iron works and flour mills, the largest of their kind in [[Southeastern United States|the South]].

The [[Seven Days Battles]] followed in late June and early July 1862, during which commanding Union General-in-Chief [[George B. McClellan]] threatened to take Richmond in the [[Peninsula campaign]] but failed.\n\nThree years later, in March 1865, Richmond became indefensible after nearby [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken. On March 25 Confederate General [[John B. Gordon]]'s desperate attack on [[Battle of Fort Stedman|Fort Stedman]] east of Petersburg failed. On April 1 Federal Cavalry General [[Philip Sheridan]], assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by Southern General [[George Pickett]] at the [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]] junction, smashing them, taking thousands of prisoners, and encouraging Union General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to order a general advance. When the Union Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on the Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5,000, about a tenth of Lee's defending army. Lee then informed President [[Jefferson Davis]] that he was about to evacuate Richmond.<ref>Levine pp. 271\u201372</ref>\n\nDavis and his cabinet, along with the government archives and Treasury gold, left the city by train that night, as government officials burned documents and departing Confederate troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny their contents to the victors.

After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered Weitzel to prevent the former Confederate state legislature from meeting. Union forces killed, wounded or captured 8,000 Confederate troops at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]] southwest of Petersburg on April 6, as the Southerners continued a general retreat southwestward.

From [[Lewis Hallam]]'s early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest,<ref>Macready, William, ''The diaries of William Charles Macready, 1833\u20131851, Volume 2'', p. 416</ref> and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day under the name Virginia Repertory Theatre.\n* [[Virginia Repertory Theatre]] is Central Virginia's largest professional theatre organization. It was created in 2012 when Barksdale Theatre and Theatre IV, which had shared one staff for over a decade, merged to become one company. With an annual budget of over $5 million, the theatre employs over 240 artists each year, presenting a season at the November Theatre and Theatre Gym at Virginia Rep Center, as well as productions at the Hanover Tavern and The Children's Theatre in The Shops at Willow Lawn. The historic November Theatre opened in 1911 as the Empire Theatre, offering stock and vaudeville performances. In 1915 it changed its name from the Empire to the Strand and continued under that name until damaged by fire in 1927. It reopened in 1933 as the \"Booker T,\" and served as the leading black movie house for many years when Richmond was segregated. It closed in 1974 and was idle until real estate developer Mitchell Kambis rescued and renovated it. Kambis restored the Empire name and in 1979 leased it to Keith Fowler, artistic director of the American Revels Company. Revels restored live professional theater to downtown Richmond. Revels was succeeded by Theatre IV in 1984. On its 100th anniversary in 2011 the theatre was further restored when Sara Belle and Neil November made a $2 million gift to Theatre IV and Barksdale.[1] The November now serves as Virginia Rep's headquarters and home and anchors the Arts District. It is currently under the leadership of Artistic Director Bruce Miller and Managing Director Phil Whiteway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/03/know-a-theatre-virginia-repertory-theatre-of-richmond-va/ |title=Know a Theatre: Virginia Repertory Theatre of Richmond, Va. |work=americantheatre.org |access-date=June 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923181446/http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/03/know-a-theatre-virginia-repertory-theatre-of-richmond-va/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Richmond Ballet]], founded in 1957.\n* [[Richmond Triangle Players]], founded in 1993, delivers theater programs exploring themes of equality, identity, affection and family across sexual orientation and gender spectrums.\n* [[Richmond Symphony]]\n* [[Virginia Opera]], the Official Opera Company of the Commonwealth of Virginia, founded in 1974.

The city contains diverse styles, including significant examples of Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, Egyptian Revival, Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Tudor Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Modernist, International, and Postmodern buildings.\n\nMuch of Richmond's early architecture was destroyed by the Evacuation Fire in 1865. It is estimated that 25% of all buildings in Richmond were destroyed during this fire.<ref>Hansen, Harry. \"The Civil War: A History.\" Published 2002, Signet Classic. {{ISBN|978-0-451-52849-0}}</ref> Even fewer now remain due to construction and [[urban renewal|demolition]] that has taken place since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In spite of this, Richmond contains many historically significant buildings and districts. Buildings remain from Richmond's colonial period, such as the [[Patteson-Schutte House]] and the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia)]], both built before 1750.\n\n[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|right|[[Egyptian Building]] of the VCU School of Medicine (1845)]]\nArchitectural classicism is heavily represented in all districts of the city, particularly in Downtown, the Fan, and the Museum District. Several notable classical architects have designed buildings in Richmond. The Virginia State Capitol was designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] in 1785. It is the second-oldest US statehouse in continuous use (after Maryland's) and was the first US government building built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style of architecture, setting the trend for other state houses and the federal government buildings (including the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|The Capitol]]) in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"jefferson_capital\">\"[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ Jefferson & The Capital Of Virginia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115150112/http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ |date=January 15, 2010 }}.\" An Exhibition at the [[Library of Virginia]]; January 7&nbsp;\u2013 June 15, 2002.

Adjoining it is the 1845 [[Egyptian Building]], one of the few [[Egyptian Revival]] buildings in the United States.\n\n[[File:Science Museum - Broad Street Station (2256100684).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Science Museum of Virginia]], housed in [[Broad Street Station (Richmond)|Broad Street Station]], designed by [[John Russell Pope]]]]\nThe firm of [[John Russell Pope]] designed [[Broad Street Station (Richmond)|Broad Street Station]] as well as [[Branch House]] on [[Monument Avenue]], designed as a private residence in the Tudor style, now serving as the Branch Museum of Architecture and Design. Broad Street Station (or Union Station), designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style, is no longer a functioning station but is now home to the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. [[Main Street Station (Richmond)|Main Street Station]], designed by Wilson, Harris, and Richards, has been returned to use in its original purpose. The Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club were both designed by the classically trained Beaux-Arts architects Carr\u00e8re and Hastings. Many buildings on the [[University of Richmond]] campus, including Jeter Hall and Ryland Hall, were designed by [[Ralph Adams Cram]], most famous for his Princeton University Chapel and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.\n\nRichmond's urban residential neighborhoods also hold particular significance to the city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely single use town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's growth in population over the last decade has been concentrated in these areas.\n\nAmong Richmond's most interesting architectural features is its [[Cast-iron architecture]]. Second only to [[New Orleans]] in its concentration of cast iron work, the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports.<ref>Robert P. Winthrop, Cast and Wrought: The Architectural Metalwork of Richmond, Virginia, (Richmond, Virginia: Valentine Museum, 1980), 93.</ref> Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application.\n\nRichmond is home to several notable instances of various styles of modernism. [[Minoru Yamasaki]] designed the Federal Reserve Building which dominates the downtown skyline. The [[architectural firm]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] has designed two buildings: the [[Library of Virginia]] and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. [[Philip Johnson]] designed the [[WRVA Building]]. The [[Richard Neutra]]-designed [[Rice House (Richmond, Virginia)|Rice House]], a residence on a private island on the James River, remains Richmond's only true International Style home. The W.G. Harris residence in Richmond was designed by famed early modern architect and member of the [[Harvard Five]],<ref>\"The Harvard Five in New Canaan\", William D. Earls AIA, W. W Norton and Co., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-393-73183-5}}</ref> [[Landis Gores]]. The VCU [[Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond|Institute for Contemporary Art]], designed by [[Steven Holl]], opened in 2018. Other notable architects to have worked in the city include Rick Mather, [[I.M. Pei]], and [[Gordon Bunshaft]].\n\nMany of Richmond's historic properties were documented in books and 1970s era black and white photographs by [[John G. Zehmer]], an architectural historian and preservationist.\n\n===Historic districts===\n\nRichmond's City Code provides for the creation of old and historic districts so as to \"recognize and protect the historic, architectural, cultural, and artistic heritage of the City\".<ref>[https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.2PU City Code of Richmond, Virginia, Section 30-930.2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625033821/https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.2PU |date=June 25, 2016 }}.</ref> Pursuant to that authority, the city has designated 45 districts throughout the city.<ref>[https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.5ESPAOLHIDI City Code of Richmond, Virginia, Section 30-930.5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625034925/https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.5ESPAOLHIDI |date=June 25, 2016 }}.</ref> The majority of these districts are also listed in the [[Virginia Landmarks Register]] (\"VLR\") and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (\"NRHP\").\n\nFifteen of the districts represent broad sections of the city:<ref>Detailed descriptions of these districts are provided by the city in [http://www.richmondgov.com/CommissionArchitecturalReview/documents/Old_Historic_Dist.pdf Old & Historic Districts of Richmond, Virginia, Handbook and Design Review Guidelines (1st Edition, December, 2006, updated January, 2015), p. 11] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100203/http://www.richmondgov.com/CommissionArchitecturalReview/documents/Old_Historic_Dist.pdf |date=October 17, 2016 }}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Today, Monroe Park sits adjacent to the [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] campus and is one of more than 40 parks comprising a total of more than {{convert|1500|acre|ha}}.\n\nSeveral parks are located along the James River, and the James River Parks System offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks along the river's route through the city.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | title = James River Park System Mountain Biking Trails | website = Trailforks | access-date = August 26, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002242/https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | archive-date = September 22, 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref> The trails are used as part of the Xterra East Championship course for both the running and mountain biking portions of the off-road triathlon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html|title=XTERRA East Championship|author=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=November 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923213653/http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html|archive-date=September 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are also parks on two major islands in the river: [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]] and Brown's Island. Belle Isle, at various former times a Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two, and contains many bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for [[rock climbing]] instruction. One can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the Civil War prison camp, such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that was used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is a smaller island and a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals in the spring and summer, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series or the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.\n\n[[File:MaymontPark JapaneseGarden.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese Garden at [[Maymont]]]]\nTwo other major parks in the city along the river are [[Byrd Park]] and [[Maymont]], located near the Fan District.

Prominently featured in the park is the [[Carillon|World War I Memorial Carillon]], built in 1926 as a memorial to those that died in the war. Maymont, located adjacent to Byrd Park, is a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] estate with a museum, formal gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, [[carriage]] collection, and children's farm.

Several rafting companies offer complete services. There are also several easily accessed riverside areas within the city limits for rock-hopping, swimming, and picnicking.\n\n[[Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden]] is located adjacent to the city in Henrico County. Founded in 1984, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is located on {{convert|80|acre|m2}} and features a glass conservatory, a rose garden, a healing garden, and an accessible-to-all children's garden.

Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to 4 years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.\n\nIn 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of [[Curtis Holt Jr.]] who had claimed the council's existing election process&nbsp;\u2014 an at large voting system&nbsp;\u2014 was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black mayor, [[Henry L. Marsh]].\n\nIn 1990 religion and politics intersected to impact the outcome of the Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond.\n\nRichmond's government changed in 2004 from a [[council-manager]] form of government to an at-large, popularly elected Mayor. In a landslide election, incumbent mayor Rudy McCollum was defeated by [[L. Douglas Wilder]], who previously served Virginia as the first elected African American governor in the United States since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The current mayor of Richmond is [[Levar Stoney]] who was elected in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richmond City Government|url=http://www.richmondgov.com/Mayor/index.aspx|accessdate=January 30, 2017|ref=Richmond City Site|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129072427/http://www.richmondgov.com/Mayor/index.aspx|archive-date=January 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The mayor is not a part of the Richmond City Council.\n\n{{As of|2017|df=US}}, the Richmond City Council consisted of:\n* Chris A.

To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed [[James River bateau]]x above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, [[George Washington]] helped design the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] from [[Westham, Virginia|Westham]] east to Richmond, to bypass Richmond's rapids on the upper James River with the intent of providing a water route across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Kanawha River]] flowing westward into the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] then eventually to the [[Mississippi River]]. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag.

The [[Seven Days Battles]] followed in late June and early July 1862, during which commanding Union General-in-Chief [[George B. McClellan]] threatened to take Richmond in the [[Peninsula campaign]] but failed.\n\nThree years later, in March 1865, Richmond became indefensible after nearby [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken. On March 25 Confederate General [[John B. Gordon]]'s desperate attack on [[Battle of Fort Stedman|Fort Stedman]] east of Petersburg failed. On April 1 Federal Cavalry General [[Philip Sheridan]], assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by Southern General [[George Pickett]] at the [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]] junction, smashing them, taking thousands of prisoners, and encouraging Union General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S.

Union forces killed, wounded or captured 8,000 Confederate troops at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]] southwest of Petersburg on April 6, as the Southerners continued a general retreat southwestward. Lee continued to reject Grant's surrender suggestions until Sheridan's infantry and cavalry moved around the shrinking [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and appeared in front of his withdrawing forces on April 8, cutting off the line of further retreat southwest.

From [[Lewis Hallam]]'s early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest,<ref>Macready, William, ''The diaries of William Charles Macready, 1833\u20131851, Volume 2'', p. 416</ref> and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day under the name Virginia Repertory Theatre.\n* [[Virginia Repertory Theatre]] is Central Virginia's largest professional theatre organization. It was created in 2012 when Barksdale Theatre and Theatre IV, which had shared one staff for over a decade, merged to become one company. With an annual budget of over $5 million, the theatre employs over 240 artists each year, presenting a season at the November Theatre and Theatre Gym at Virginia Rep Center, as well as productions at the Hanover Tavern and The Children's Theatre in The Shops at Willow Lawn. The historic November Theatre opened in 1911 as the Empire Theatre, offering stock and vaudeville performances. In 1915 it changed its name from the Empire to the Strand and continued under that name until damaged by fire in 1927. It reopened in 1933 as the \"Booker T,\" and served as the leading black movie house for many years when Richmond was segregated. It closed in 1974 and was idle until real estate developer Mitchell Kambis rescued and renovated it. Kambis restored the Empire name and in 1979 leased it to Keith Fowler, artistic director of the American Revels Company. Revels restored live professional theater to downtown Richmond. Revels was succeeded by Theatre IV in 1984. On its 100th anniversary in 2011 the theatre was further restored when Sara Belle and Neil November made a $2 million gift to Theatre IV and Barksdale.[1] The November now serves as Virginia Rep's headquarters and home and anchors the Arts District. It is currently under the leadership of Artistic Director Bruce Miller and Managing Director Phil Whiteway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/03/know-a-theatre-virginia-repertory-theatre-of-richmond-va/ |title=Know a Theatre: Virginia Repertory Theatre of Richmond, Va. |work=americantheatre.org |access-date=June 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923181446/http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/03/know-a-theatre-virginia-repertory-theatre-of-richmond-va/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Richmond Ballet]], founded in 1957.\n* [[Richmond Triangle Players]], founded in 1993, delivers theater programs exploring themes of equality, identity, affection and family across sexual orientation and gender spectrums.\n* [[Richmond Symphony]]\n* [[Virginia Opera]], the Official Opera Company of the Commonwealth of Virginia, founded in 1974.

The city contains diverse styles, including significant examples of Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, Egyptian Revival, Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Tudor Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Modernist, International, and Postmodern buildings.\n\nMuch of Richmond's early architecture was destroyed by the Evacuation Fire in 1865. It is estimated that 25% of all buildings in Richmond were destroyed during this fire.<ref>Hansen, Harry. \"The Civil War: A History.\" Published 2002, Signet Classic. {{ISBN|978-0-451-52849-0}}</ref> Even fewer now remain due to construction and [[urban renewal|demolition]] that has taken place since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In spite of this, Richmond contains many historically significant buildings and districts. Buildings remain from Richmond's colonial period, such as the [[Patteson-Schutte House]] and the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia)]], both built before 1750.\n\n[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|right|[[Egyptian Building]] of the VCU School of Medicine (1845)]]\nArchitectural classicism is heavily represented in all districts of the city, particularly in Downtown, the Fan, and the Museum District. Several notable classical architects have designed buildings in Richmond. The Virginia State Capitol was designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] in 1785. It is the second-oldest US statehouse in continuous use (after Maryland's) and was the first US government building built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style of architecture, setting the trend for other state houses and the federal government buildings (including the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|The Capitol]]) in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"jefferson_capital\">\"[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ Jefferson & The Capital Of Virginia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115150112/http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ |date=January 15, 2010 }}.\" An Exhibition at the [[Library of Virginia]]; January 7&nbsp;\u2013 June 15, 2002.

Broad Street Station (or Union Station), designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style, is no longer a functioning station but is now home to the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. [[Main Street Station (Richmond)|Main Street Station]], designed by Wilson, Harris, and Richards, has been returned to use in its original purpose. The Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club were both designed by the classically trained Beaux-Arts architects Carr\u00e8re and Hastings. Many buildings on the [[University of Richmond]] campus, including Jeter Hall and Ryland Hall, were designed by [[Ralph Adams Cram]], most famous for his Princeton University Chapel and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.\n\nRichmond's urban residential neighborhoods also hold particular significance to the city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely single use town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's growth in population over the last decade has been concentrated in these areas.\n\nAmong Richmond's most interesting architectural features is its [[Cast-iron architecture]]. Second only to [[New Orleans]] in its concentration of cast iron work, the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports.<ref>Robert P. Winthrop, Cast and Wrought: The Architectural Metalwork of Richmond, Virginia, (Richmond, Virginia: Valentine Museum, 1980), 93.</ref> Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application.\n\nRichmond is home to several notable instances of various styles of modernism. [[Minoru Yamasaki]] designed the Federal Reserve Building which dominates the downtown skyline. The [[architectural firm]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] has designed two buildings: the [[Library of Virginia]] and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. [[Philip Johnson]] designed the [[WRVA Building]]. The [[Richard Neutra]]-designed [[Rice House (Richmond, Virginia)|Rice House]], a residence on a private island on the James River, remains Richmond's only true International Style home. The W.G. Harris residence in Richmond was designed by famed early modern architect and member of the [[Harvard Five]],<ref>\"The Harvard Five in New Canaan\", William D. Earls AIA, W.

The VCU [[Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond|Institute for Contemporary Art]], designed by [[Steven Holl]], opened in 2018. Other notable architects to have worked in the city include Rick Mather, [[I.M.

The park system began when the city council voted in 1851 to acquire {{convert|7.5|acre|m2}}, now known as [[Monroe Park]]. Today, Monroe Park sits adjacent to the [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] campus and is one of more than 40 parks comprising a total of more than {{convert|1500|acre|ha}}.\n\nSeveral parks are located along the James River, and the James River Parks System offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks along the river's route through the city.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | title = James River Park System Mountain Biking Trails | website = Trailforks | access-date = August 26, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002242/https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | archive-date = September 22, 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref> The trails are used as part of the Xterra East Championship course for both the running and mountain biking portions of the off-road triathlon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html|title=XTERRA East Championship|author=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=November 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923213653/http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html|archive-date=September 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are also parks on two major islands in the river: [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]] and Brown's Island. Belle Isle, at various former times a Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two, and contains many bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for [[rock climbing]] instruction. One can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the Civil War prison camp, such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that was used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is a smaller island and a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals in the spring and summer, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series or the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.\n\n[[File:MaymontPark JapaneseGarden.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese Garden at [[Maymont]]]]\nTwo other major parks in the city along the river are [[Byrd Park]] and [[Maymont]], located near the Fan District. Byrd Park features a {{convert|1|mi|spell=in|adj=on}} running track, with exercise stops, a public [[dog park]], and a number of small lakes for small boats, as well as two monuments, Buddha house, and an amphitheatre. Prominently featured in the park is the [[Carillon|World War I Memorial Carillon]], built in 1926 as a memorial to those that died in the war. Maymont, located adjacent to Byrd Park, is a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] estate with a museum, formal gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, [[carriage]] collection, and children's farm. Other parks in the city include [[Joseph Bryan Park Azalea Garden]], Forest Hill Park (former site of the Forest Hill Amusement Park), [[Chimborazo Park]] (site of the National Battlefield Headquarters), among others.\n\nThe James River itself through Richmond is renowned as one of the best in the country for urban white-water rafting/canoeing/kayaking. Several rafting companies offer complete services. There are also several easily accessed riverside areas within the city limits for rock-hopping, swimming, and picnicking.\n\n[[Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden]] is located adjacent to the city in Henrico County.

Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to 4 years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.\n\nIn 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of [[Curtis Holt Jr.]] who had claimed the council's existing election process&nbsp;\u2014 an at large voting system&nbsp;\u2014 was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black mayor, [[Henry L. Marsh]].\n\nIn 1990 religion and politics intersected to impact the outcome of the Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond.\n\nRichmond's government changed in 2004 from a [[council-manager]] form of government to an at-large, popularly elected Mayor.

The 75-ton crane stood 400 feet tall and was installed over the course of four days. Removal of the crane began in October 1995, with the use of a second crane. The dismantling of the crane was one of the most significant challenges for the people working on the tower. The unique design of the tower pod and its limit space required construction crews to carefully plan the installation of the second crane, which weighed 30 tons. The second crane would lower pieces of the original crane to the ground, and would then be used to lift a seven-ton [[derrick]] into place, allowing workers to carry down sections of the second crane. The derrick would then be disassembled by hand, and workers would use a construction elevator to bring down the pieces.

In early October 1989, Stupak submitted plans to the city for the approval of the neon sign tower which would stand four times taller than the hotel. Later in the week, Stupak withdrew his plans to allow time for a revised version of the tower that would include an elevator leading up to an [[observation deck]]. Stupak, who wanted the tower to become a local landmark, said, \"What I'm trying to do for Las Vegas is what the [[Eiffel Tower]] did for [[Paris]], what the [[Empire State Building]] did for [[New York City|New York]], what the Seattle [[Space Needle]] did for [[Seattle]].\"<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite news|title=Stupak wants a landmark|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9617823/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=2017-03-20|work=[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]|date=1989-10-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Sign\">{{cite news|title=Vegas council turns down sign ordinance|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9617842/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=2017-03-20|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=1989-10-20}}</ref> Stupak's plans received widespread opposition,<ref name=Towers/> including from Las Vegas city staff, who drafted an [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] that would have limited signs to 35 feet in height.<ref name=Landmark/> The [[Las Vegas City Council]] rejected the ordinance, considering it to be a poorly drawn measure aimed specifically at stopping Stupak's project.<ref name=Sign/>\n\nIn February 1990, Stupak unveiled his revised plans for a $50 million, 1,012-foot observation tower with a top floor that would include a revolving restaurant and four penthouse suites.<ref>{{cite news|title=Revised plans unveiled|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9617993/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=2017-03-20|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=1990-02-14}}</ref> In April 1990, the city council approved Stupak's tower, despite objections from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), which stated that it was 200 feet (61 m) too tall.<ref>{{cite news|title=Las Vegas approves tower|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9618016/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=2017-03-20|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=1990-04-19}}</ref> [[Nellis Air Force Base]] also opposed the tower.

The 75-ton crane stood 400 feet tall and was installed over the course of four days. Removal of the crane began in October 1995, with the use of a second crane. The dismantling of the crane was one of the most significant challenges for the people working on the tower. The unique design of the tower pod and its limit space required construction crews to carefully plan the installation of the second crane, which weighed 30 tons.
