ENMU is New Mexico's largest regional comprehensive university and is the most recently founded state university in New Mexico (legislated in 1927, opened in 1934). It is a federally designated [[Hispanic-serving institution]] and a member of the [[Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities]]. The ENMU System consists of three campuses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ENMU Administration building from NW 1.JPG|thumb|left|Main administration building]]\n[[Image:ENMU1.jpg|thumb|A view of the main quad of ENMU.]]\n[[File:Walkway outside Golden Library, NMU.jpg|thumb|Central campus walkway]]\nThe New Mexico legislature approved the construction and staffing of a [[normal school]] in eastern [[New Mexico]] in 1927, and approved [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] for construction in 1929, but the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] hindered the school's opening, which was delayed until 1934 (construction had begun in 1931).\n\nFrom 1934 to 1940, the institution, first named '''Eastern New Mexico Junior College (ENMJC)''' operated as a [[community college]].<ref>http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/nm/roosevelt/history/history.txt</ref> In 1940, the third and fourth years of college were first offered, leading to a [[bachelor's degree]], and the institution was renamed '''Eastern New Mexico College''' ('''ENMC'''). ENMC was accredited by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]] as a four-year [[liberal arts college]] in 1946\u201347. Graduate work leading to the [[master's degree]] in some departments was added in 1949, and on April 5, 1949, the Board of Regents approved the change of the institution's name to '''Eastern New Mexico University'''.\n\n==ENMU System==\nENMU's main campus (ENMU-Portales), consisting of over {{convert|400|acre|km2}},<ref name=\"enmu.edu\"/> is located in Portales on the extreme eastern border of New Mexico, in the [[Eastern New Mexico]]/[[Llano Estacado]] region about halfway between the northern and southern boundaries of the state. (Portales is {{convert|90|mi|km}} northeast of [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], {{convert|120|mi|km}} southwest of [[Amarillo, Texas]], and {{convert|110|mi|km}} northwest of [[Lubbock, Texas]].) ENMU owns [[KENW (TV)]] and [[KENW-FM]], a public television and radio station that are housed and operated on the main campus. The president of ENMU-Portales also serves as the chancellor for the ENMU System.\n\nThe '''ENMU Ruidoso Campus''', ENMU-Ruidoso, is a two-year college or community college (one of 18 in New Mexico) and an official branch of ENMU (branch status being granted in July 2005). Undergraduate and graduate coursework completed at the ENMU-Ruidoso campus is transferable for credit toward an undergraduate or graduate degree at ENMU-Portales, and, typically other undergraduate/graduate institutions in the United States. In 1991, the Ruidoso location had been established as the '''ENMU Ruidoso Branch Community College''' and offered two-year college academic and vocational programs. ENMU-Ruidoso offers Certificates of Completion, [[Associate of Science]], [[Associate of Arts]], and [[Associate of Applied Science]] degrees, as well as community education classes, customized training workshops, and adult basic education courses. It operates a One-Stop Career Center which provides free employment services for employers and job seekers in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]].  The center offers both an academic and vocational curriculum. (Ruidoso is located southwest of Portales, in a mountainous region of south-central New Mexico.)\n\nThe '''ENMU Roswell Campus''', ENMU-Roswell, also a two-year branch, offers a wide variety of programs. ENMU-Roswell was established in the fall of 1958. In the spring of 1967, the institution moved to 12 buildings on {{convert|241|acre|km2}} of the former [[Walker Air Force Base]]. Roswell is one of New Mexico's larger cities, located in the southeast section of the state.\n\nENMU also offers online degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern New Mexico University Online Degrees|url=https://www.enmu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/online-programs|accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref> ENMU's online degrees in the fields of business and education are the most affordable in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Most Affordable U.S. Online Colleges|url=http://www.onlineu.org/college-rankings/most-affordable|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Academic organization==\nENMU-Portales consists of four colleges and a graduate school:\n\n;College of Business\n\n;College of Education and Technology\n*Department of Educational Studies\n*Department of Curriculum and Instruction\n*Department of Agriculture, Food Science and Kinesiology <ref>{{cite web|title=College of Education and Technology|url=https://www.enmu.edu/academics/colleges-departments/college-of-education-and-technology|accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n;College of Fine Arts\n*Department of Art\n*Department of Communication\n*Department of Music\n*Department of Theatre and Digital Filmmaking\n\n;College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n*Department of Anthropology and Applied Archaeology\n*Department of Biology\n*Department of Health and Human Services (Communicative Disorders, Social Work, Nursing, Emergency Management)\n*Department of History, Social Sciences and Religion\n*Department of Languages and Literature\n*Department of Mathematical Sciences\n*Department of Physical Sciences (Chemistry, Physics, Aviation Science)\n*Department of Psychology and Political Science\n\n;Graduate School\n*Anthropology\n*Biology\n*Business Administration\n*Chemistry\n**Analytical Chemistry\n**Biochemistry\n**Organic Chemistry\n**Physical Chemistry\n*Communication\n*Communicative Disorders\n*Counseling\n*Education\n**Alternative Licensure\n***Elementary Education\n***Secondary Education\n***Special Education\n**Bilingual Education\n**Career and Technical Education\n**Early Childhood Education\n**Education Administration\n**Educational Technology\n**Gifted Education Pedagogy\n**Pedagogy and Learning\n**Reading/Literacy\n**School Counseling\n**Secondary Education\n**Special Education\n**Special Education Pedagogy\n*Physical Education\n**Coaching\n**Sport Administration\n*Nursing\n\n==Other facilities==\nAmong ENMU's other facilities are 5 museums, an art gallery, and a library.\n\n===Golden Student Success Center===\nThe Golden Student Success Center (GSSC) construction was completed in 2018 replacing the original Golden Library building.

ENMU is New Mexico's largest regional comprehensive university and is the most recently founded state university in New Mexico (legislated in 1927, opened in 1934). It is a federally designated [[Hispanic-serving institution]] and a member of the [[Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities]]. The ENMU System consists of three campuses. ENMU's main campus (ENMU-Portales) is located in Portales; there are two associate degree-granting branches, one at [[Ruidoso, New Mexico|Ruidoso]] and one at [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:ENMU Administration building from NW 1.JPG|thumb|left|Main administration building]]\n[[Image:ENMU1.jpg|thumb|A view of the main quad of ENMU.]]\n[[File:Walkway outside Golden Library, NMU.jpg|thumb|Central campus walkway]]\nThe New Mexico legislature approved the construction and staffing of a [[normal school]] in eastern [[New Mexico]] in 1927, and approved [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] for construction in 1929, but the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] hindered the school's opening, which was delayed until 1934 (construction had begun in 1931).\n\nFrom 1934 to 1940, the institution, first named '''Eastern New Mexico Junior College (ENMJC)''' operated as a [[community college]].<ref>http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/nm/roosevelt/history/history.txt</ref> In 1940, the third and fourth years of college were first offered, leading to a [[bachelor's degree]], and the institution was renamed '''Eastern New Mexico College''' ('''ENMC'''). ENMC was accredited by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]] as a four-year [[liberal arts college]] in 1946\u201347. Graduate work leading to the [[master's degree]] in some departments was added in 1949, and on April 5, 1949, the Board of Regents approved the change of the institution's name to '''Eastern New Mexico University'''.\n\n==ENMU System==\nENMU's main campus (ENMU-Portales), consisting of over {{convert|400|acre|km2}},<ref name=\"enmu.edu\"/> is located in Portales on the extreme eastern border of New Mexico, in the [[Eastern New Mexico]]/[[Llano Estacado]] region about halfway between the northern and southern boundaries of the state. (Portales is {{convert|90|mi|km}} northeast of [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], {{convert|120|mi|km}} southwest of [[Amarillo, Texas]], and {{convert|110|mi|km}} northwest of [[Lubbock, Texas]].) ENMU owns [[KENW (TV)]] and [[KENW-FM]], a public television and radio station that are housed and operated on the main campus. The president of ENMU-Portales also serves as the chancellor for the ENMU System.\n\nThe '''ENMU Ruidoso Campus''', ENMU-Ruidoso, is a two-year college or community college (one of 18 in New Mexico) and an official branch of ENMU (branch status being granted in July 2005). Undergraduate and graduate coursework completed at the ENMU-Ruidoso campus is transferable for credit toward an undergraduate or graduate degree at ENMU-Portales, and, typically other undergraduate/graduate institutions in the United States. In 1991, the Ruidoso location had been established as the '''ENMU Ruidoso Branch Community College''' and offered two-year college academic and vocational programs. ENMU-Ruidoso offers Certificates of Completion, [[Associate of Science]], [[Associate of Arts]], and [[Associate of Applied Science]] degrees, as well as community education classes, customized training workshops, and adult basic education courses. It operates a One-Stop Career Center which provides free employment services for employers and job seekers in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]].  The center offers both an academic and vocational curriculum. (Ruidoso is located southwest of Portales, in a mountainous region of south-central New Mexico.)\n\nThe '''ENMU Roswell Campus''', ENMU-Roswell, also a two-year branch, offers a wide variety of programs. ENMU-Roswell was established in the fall of 1958. In the spring of 1967, the institution moved to 12 buildings on {{convert|241|acre|km2}} of the former [[Walker Air Force Base]]. Roswell is one of New Mexico's larger cities, located in the southeast section of the state.\n\nENMU also offers online degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern New Mexico University Online Degrees|url=https://www.enmu.edu/academics/degrees-programs/online-programs|accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref> ENMU's online degrees in the fields of business and education are the most affordable in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Most Affordable U.S. Online Colleges|url=http://www.onlineu.org/college-rankings/most-affordable|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Academic organization==\nENMU-Portales consists of four colleges and a graduate school:\n\n;College of Business\n\n;College of Education and Technology\n*Department of Educational Studies\n*Department of Curriculum and Instruction\n*Department of Agriculture, Food Science and Kinesiology <ref>{{cite web|title=College of Education and Technology|url=https://www.enmu.edu/academics/colleges-departments/college-of-education-and-technology|accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n;College of Fine Arts\n*Department of Art\n*Department of Communication\n*Department of Music\n*Department of Theatre and Digital Filmmaking\n\n;College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n*Department of Anthropology and Applied Archaeology\n*Department of Biology\n*Department of Health and Human Services (Communicative Disorders, Social Work, Nursing, Emergency Management)\n*Department of History, Social Sciences and Religion\n*Department of Languages and Literature\n*Department of Mathematical Sciences\n*Department of Physical Sciences (Chemistry, Physics, Aviation Science)\n*Department of Psychology and Political Science\n\n;Graduate School\n*Anthropology\n*Biology\n*Business Administration\n*Chemistry\n**Analytical Chemistry\n**Biochemistry\n**Organic Chemistry\n**Physical Chemistry\n*Communication\n*Communicative Disorders\n*Counseling\n*Education\n**Alternative Licensure\n***Elementary Education\n***Secondary Education\n***Special Education\n**Bilingual Education\n**Career and Technical Education\n**Early Childhood Education\n**Education Administration\n**Educational Technology\n**Gifted Education Pedagogy\n**Pedagogy and Learning\n**Reading/Literacy\n**School Counseling\n**Secondary Education\n**Special Education\n**Special Education Pedagogy\n*Physical Education\n**Coaching\n**Sport Administration\n*Nursing\n\n==Other facilities==\nAmong ENMU's other facilities are 5 museums, an art gallery, and a library.\n\n===Golden Student Success Center===\nThe Golden Student Success Center (GSSC) construction was completed in 2018 replacing the original Golden Library building.

It was originally clustered along a stream, named 'Hole Beck', about half a mile up the hill from the estuary below. It was also the junction of four roads passing through the area. Firstly, there was the 'Sands' road, named 'Marsh Lane' in maps of the 1850s, heading down the hill towards the shore, where it met one of the possible routes for crossing the treacherous tidal sands of the [[River Duddon|Duddon]] at low tide. Secondly, there was the lane heading north along a ridge towards [[Kirkby-in-Furness]]. Part of these two roads form today's A595 main road.

Firstly, there was the 'Sands' road, named 'Marsh Lane' in maps of the 1850s, heading down the hill towards the shore, where it met one of the possible routes for crossing the treacherous tidal sands of the [[River Duddon|Duddon]] at low tide. Secondly, there was the lane heading north along a ridge towards [[Kirkby-in-Furness]]. Part of these two roads form today's A595 main road.
