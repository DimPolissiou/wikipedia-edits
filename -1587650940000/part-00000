It is a suburb of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of the state.\n\nThe population of Whitehall Township was 26,738 at the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\n\n===1600s\u20131700s===\nThe province of Pennsylvania was created in 1681 when King Charles II granted a tract of land in America to William Penn. After the death of William Penn, his sons, John, Thomas, and Richard, became the owners of Pennsylvania. The Delaware Indians deeded that part of Lehigh County lying between the Lehigh (South) Mountain and the Blue Mountains to Penn\u2019s sons in 1736.\n\nA wave of immigrants from Germany\u2019s Palatinate settled in Whitehall Township, the first being Jacob Kohler, who settled in the vicinity of Egypt about 1728. The settlers staked their claim on the lands by applying to the Penn's for a land warrant. They cleared the land for farming and established churches around which villages grew.\n\nWhen the first European settlers came to the Whitehall area, the Lenape Indians were living on the banks of the Hokendauqua River. The Europeans and the Lenape Indians designed a deal to determine how much land the Europeans would acquire based on how far the Europeans were able to walk in two days. To gain more land, the Europeans paid a professional runner. The runner was able to get as far as what is now Coaldale, Pennsylvania, in Schuylkill County. A walk east got them as far as Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe local tribe of Native Americans, the Lenni Lenapes, lived peacefully among the white settlers for a time. The tribe suffered injustices at the hands of the settlers and lashed back during a 1763 uprising in Lehigh County. Fort Deshler, which stood near Route 145 at Chestnut Street, played a key role in the defense of settler-held lands during this battle, in which 23 settlers were killed.\n\n===1800s\u2013early 1900s===\n\nThe original Whitehall Township, established in 1753, was split into the three townships of Whitehall, North Whitehall, and South Whitehall in 1867. The name Whitehall is said to have originated from Lynford Lardner\u2019s hunting lodge that was painted with whitewash. Lardner named it \u201cGrouse Hall,\" but the common people of the region called it \u201cWhite Hall.\" Whitehall Township\u2019s villages include Cementon, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, Stiles, and West Catasauqua. Coplay was also part of Whitehall until it incorporated as a borough in 1869.\n\nAgriculture was the major industry until the mid-1800s. Today, about {{convert|2000|acres|0|abbr=on}} are under cultivation. There were six [[grist mill]]s in Whitehall, built to process grains for the farmers into flour and animal feed. Only one grist mill remains - the Helfrich Springs Grist Mill. It is the home of the Whitehall Historical Preservation Society, which has preserved the building for use as a local history museum.\n\nCompletion of the Lehigh Canal in 1829 led to further development. Discovery of iron ore deposits brought Whitehall into the Industrial Revolution when the first blast iron furnace was built in Hokendauqua in 1854. This was immediately followed by the establishment of a railroad system to transport raw materials to the furnaces and to ship the final product. Population grew rapidly as these industries attracted Welsh and Irish immigrants.\n\nWhile the railroads were being constructed, cuts in the bedrock led to the discovery of Whitehall \u2019s deposits of Jacksonburg limestone or \u201ccement rock\u201d. David O. Saylor perfected and patented the process of manufacturing Portland Cement. The first Portland Cement plant was located between the villages of Cementon and Coplay. Others quickly followed and, by 1914, 70% of the cement produced in the United States came from the \u201cCement Belt\u201d or Lehigh District. The cement industry attracted a new wave of immigrants from Austria-Hungary, creating yet another population spurt.\n\nWhitehall became classified as a First Class Township with a population of 7,935 in 1900. This gave the Township specified municipal rights for supplying electric lights, highways and sewers at public expense.\n\n===Recent and present day===\n[[File:PA 145 NB past Grape Street.jpg|thumb|right|The MacArthur Road retail corridor in Whitehall]]\nThe post-World War II era began the transition from the manufacturing industries to the retail industry as Whitehall became a bedroom community as a suburb of Allentown. The individual villages became united into one entity known as Whitehall in 1968, when the U.S. Post Office combined its separate town branches.\n\nIn 1974, voters approved the adoption of a Home Rule Charter form of government, creating a seven-member legislative body and an elected Mayor. Today, with an annual budget in excess of $21 million, Whitehall provides a full range of municipal services to its residents.<ref>{{cite web|last=William|first=Ford|title=In a numbers game, Hunsicker looks to be No. 1|url=http://www.donnasellshomes.com/Community/Whitehall.html}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of 12.8&nbsp;square miles (33.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which, 12.6&nbsp;square miles (32.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is land and 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (1.80%) is water.\n\nThe township was originally created on March 20, 1753 and included what is now [[North Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|North Whitehall]] and [[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall]] Townships.  In 1810, a petition was made to the [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] Court to split the township into two portions (at the time, the area now encompassed by [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] was part of Northampton County). The name Whitehall refers to a white hall that was built along the Jordan in the early 1700s as a hunting lodge. The area had a large ruffed grouse population along with numerous white-tail deer, eastern elk, eastern wolves, and black bear. Mountain lions or cougars may have also existed within Whitehall Township at some point in time. Because of the rich biodiversity of the area it became known as the wilderness of Whitehall. Old growth forest consisting of oak, tulip poplar, hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, basswood, American chestnut, American beech, and sycamore covered the entire township.\n\nIn 1867 eastern portions of both North and South Whitehall were reapportioned into the current Whitehall Township.  The new Whitehall Township is generally rectangular in shape, running from NNW to SSE and is situated along the western bank of the Lehigh River.  Two years after the new township's formation, the [[Coplay, Pennsylvania|Borough of Coplay]] was incorporated, removing from the township a square section of 0.6 square miles (1.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Whitehall is drained by the [[Lehigh River]], which separates it from [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] and Catasauqua.\n\nIts villages include [[Cementon, Pennsylvania|Cementon]], [[Egypt, Pennsylvania|Egypt]], [[Fullerton, Pennsylvania|Fullerton]], [[Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania|Hokendauqua]], Mickleys, North Coplay, [[Scherersville, Pennsylvania|Scherersville]] (also in South Whitehall), [[Stiles, Pennsylvania|Stiles]], and [[West Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|West Catasauqua]].\n\n===Adjacent municipalities===\n*[[Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|Catasauqua]] (east)\n*[[Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township]] (southeast)\n*[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] (south)\n*[[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall Township]] (southwest)\n*[[North Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|North Whitehall Township]] (northwest)\n*[[Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Allen Township, Northampton County]] (tangent to the northeast)\n*[[Northampton, Pennsylvania|Northampton, Northampton County]] (northeast)\n*[[Coplay, Pennsylvania|Coplay]] (east)\n*[[North Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|North Catasauqua, Northampton County]] (east)\n\n===Climate===\nWhitehall Township has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') and the [[hardiness zone]] is 6b.

On November 5, 1974, the township adopted a Home Rule Charter ([http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/339/chapter21/chap21toc.html here]) form of government that became effective January 5, 1976.\n\nAs part of this governmental arrangement, the Township has separate executive and legislative branches.  The legislative branch consists of a Township Board of Commissioners of seven (7) members, each serving 4-year terms.  Four of the seats have terms that overlap the remaining three seat terms (e.g. four of the current terms end in 2007, while the remaining 3 terms end in 2009).  The seated members then elect a President and Vice President who conduct Board meetings.\n\nThe executive branch consists of a Mayor, who also serves a 4-year term.  The Mayor may appoint a Deputy Mayor at his/her discretion, with approval from the Board of Commissioners.  The Deputy Mayor does not automatically become Mayor should the standing Mayor leave office for any reason\u2014a replacement is to be appointed by the Board of Commissioners.\n\nWhitehall Township also maintains an elected Treasurer who serves a 4-year term.\n\n===Voting Districts===\nThe township is broken into twelve (12) voting districts, each with one polling place.

It is a suburb of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of the state.\n\nThe population of Whitehall Township was 26,738 at the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\n\n===1600s\u20131700s===\nThe province of Pennsylvania was created in 1681 when King Charles II granted a tract of land in America to William Penn. After the death of William Penn, his sons, John, Thomas, and Richard, became the owners of Pennsylvania. The Delaware Indians deeded that part of Lehigh County lying between the Lehigh (South) Mountain and the Blue Mountains to Penn\u2019s sons in 1736.\n\nA wave of immigrants from Germany\u2019s Palatinate settled in Whitehall Township, the first being Jacob Kohler, who settled in the vicinity of Egypt about 1728. The settlers staked their claim on the lands by applying to the Penn's for a land warrant. They cleared the land for farming and established churches around which villages grew.\n\nWhen the first European settlers came to the Whitehall area, the Lenape Indians were living on the banks of the Hokendauqua River. The Europeans and the Lenape Indians designed a deal to determine how much land the Europeans would acquire based on how far the Europeans were able to walk in two days. To gain more land, the Europeans paid a professional runner. The runner was able to get as far as what is now Coaldale, Pennsylvania, in Schuylkill County. A walk east got them as far as Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe local tribe of Native Americans, the Lenni Lenapes, lived peacefully among the white settlers for a time. The tribe suffered injustices at the hands of the settlers and lashed back during a 1763 uprising in Lehigh County. Fort Deshler, which stood near Route 145 at Chestnut Street, played a key role in the defense of settler-held lands during this battle, in which 23 settlers were killed.\n\n===1800s\u2013early 1900s===\n\nThe original Whitehall Township, established in 1753, was split into the three townships of Whitehall, North Whitehall, and South Whitehall in 1867. The name Whitehall is said to have originated from Lynford Lardner\u2019s hunting lodge that was painted with whitewash. Lardner named it \u201cGrouse Hall,\" but the common people of the region called it \u201cWhite Hall.\" Whitehall Township\u2019s villages include Cementon, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, Stiles, and West Catasauqua. Coplay was also part of Whitehall until it incorporated as a borough in 1869.\n\nAgriculture was the major industry until the mid-1800s. Today, about {{convert|2000|acres|0|abbr=on}} are under cultivation. There were six [[grist mill]]s in Whitehall, built to process grains for the farmers into flour and animal feed. Only one grist mill remains - the Helfrich Springs Grist Mill. It is the home of the Whitehall Historical Preservation Society, which has preserved the building for use as a local history museum.\n\nCompletion of the Lehigh Canal in 1829 led to further development. Discovery of iron ore deposits brought Whitehall into the Industrial Revolution when the first blast iron furnace was built in Hokendauqua in 1854. This was immediately followed by the establishment of a railroad system to transport raw materials to the furnaces and to ship the final product. Population grew rapidly as these industries attracted Welsh and Irish immigrants.\n\nWhile the railroads were being constructed, cuts in the bedrock led to the discovery of Whitehall \u2019s deposits of Jacksonburg limestone or \u201ccement rock\u201d. David O. Saylor perfected and patented the process of manufacturing Portland Cement. The first Portland Cement plant was located between the villages of Cementon and Coplay. Others quickly followed and, by 1914, 70% of the cement produced in the United States came from the \u201cCement Belt\u201d or Lehigh District. The cement industry attracted a new wave of immigrants from Austria-Hungary, creating yet another population spurt.\n\nWhitehall became classified as a First Class Township with a population of 7,935 in 1900. This gave the Township specified municipal rights for supplying electric lights, highways and sewers at public expense.\n\n===Recent and present day===\n[[File:PA 145 NB past Grape Street.jpg|thumb|right|The MacArthur Road retail corridor in Whitehall]]\nThe post-World War II era began the transition from the manufacturing industries to the retail industry as Whitehall became a bedroom community as a suburb of Allentown. The individual villages became united into one entity known as Whitehall in 1968, when the U.S. Post Office combined its separate town branches.\n\nIn 1974, voters approved the adoption of a Home Rule Charter form of government, creating a seven-member legislative body and an elected Mayor. Today, with an annual budget in excess of $21 million, Whitehall provides a full range of municipal services to its residents.<ref>{{cite web|last=William|first=Ford|title=In a numbers game, Hunsicker looks to be No. 1|url=http://www.donnasellshomes.com/Community/Whitehall.html}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of 12.8&nbsp;square miles (33.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which, 12.6&nbsp;square miles (32.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is land and 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (1.80%) is water.\n\nThe township was originally created on March 20, 1753 and included what is now [[North Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|North Whitehall]] and [[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall]] Townships.  In 1810, a petition was made to the [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] Court to split the township into two portions (at the time, the area now encompassed by [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]] was part of Northampton County). The name Whitehall refers to a white hall that was built along the Jordan in the early 1700s as a hunting lodge. The area had a large ruffed grouse population along with numerous white-tail deer, eastern elk, eastern wolves, and black bear. Mountain lions or cougars may have also existed within Whitehall Township at some point in time. Because of the rich biodiversity of the area it became known as the wilderness of Whitehall. Old growth forest consisting of oak, tulip poplar, hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, basswood, American chestnut, American beech, and sycamore covered the entire township.\n\nIn 1867 eastern portions of both North and South Whitehall were reapportioned into the current Whitehall Township.  The new Whitehall Township is generally rectangular in shape, running from NNW to SSE and is situated along the western bank of the Lehigh River.  Two years after the new township's formation, the [[Coplay, Pennsylvania|Borough of Coplay]] was incorporated, removing from the township a square section of 0.6 square miles (1.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Whitehall is drained by the [[Lehigh River]], which separates it from [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] and Catasauqua.\n\nIts villages include [[Cementon, Pennsylvania|Cementon]], [[Egypt, Pennsylvania|Egypt]], [[Fullerton, Pennsylvania|Fullerton]], [[Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania|Hokendauqua]], Mickleys, North Coplay, [[Scherersville, Pennsylvania|Scherersville]] (also in South Whitehall), [[Stiles, Pennsylvania|Stiles]], and [[West Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|West Catasauqua]].\n\n===Adjacent municipalities===\n*[[Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|Catasauqua]] (east)\n*[[Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Hanover Township]] (southeast)\n*[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] (south)\n*[[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall Township]] (southwest)\n*[[North Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|North Whitehall Township]] (northwest)\n*[[Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Allen Township, Northampton County]] (tangent to the northeast)\n*[[Northampton, Pennsylvania|Northampton, Northampton County]] (northeast)\n*[[Coplay, Pennsylvania|Coplay]] (east)\n*[[North Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|North Catasauqua, Northampton County]] (east)\n\n===Climate===\nWhitehall Township has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') and the [[hardiness zone]] is 6b.

On November 5, 1974, the township adopted a Home Rule Charter ([http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/339/chapter21/chap21toc.html here]) form of government that became effective January 5, 1976.\n\nAs part of this governmental arrangement, the Township has separate executive and legislative branches.  The legislative branch consists of a Township Board of Commissioners of seven (7) members, each serving 4-year terms.  Four of the seats have terms that overlap the remaining three seat terms (e.g. four of the current terms end in 2007, while the remaining 3 terms end in 2009).  The seated members then elect a President and Vice President who conduct Board meetings.\n\nThe executive branch consists of a Mayor, who also serves a 4-year term.  The Mayor may appoint a Deputy Mayor at his/her discretion, with approval from the Board of Commissioners.  The Deputy Mayor does not automatically become Mayor should the standing Mayor leave office for any reason\u2014a replacement is to be appointed by the Board of Commissioners.\n\nWhitehall Township also maintains an elected Treasurer who serves a 4-year term.\n\n===Voting Districts===\nThe township is broken into twelve (12) voting districts, each with one polling place.

When Yakiemon warned him about playing a prank, the koz\u014d said \"shut up\" while turning around, and there was only one eye on his face. Yakiemon raised a shriek and fell down, and was sent back to his home by the people of the estate who were surprised by his voice. Afterward, according to the people of the estate, this kind of strange occurrence happens about four or five times each year, but it doesn't particularly do anything bad.

There are several regions that have the legend that \"mountain gods are cross-eyed ([[trabismus]]),\" and since \"has one eye\" was a common way to say \"cross-eyed,\" this is also originated from the divine spirits of the mountain. Also, there are hints that there existed people who lost a leg and an eye as a [[sacrifice]] in old rituals, and according to [[hunter]]s and [[lumberjack]]s, in a legend related to nature gods deified in the mountains, one can catch a glimpse of atypical gods that took on an appearance with one eye and one foot. Other than this, since, among those who were employed in smelting iron in a [[Tatara (furnace)|tatara]] there were many people who lost one eye, there is the theory that it is related to one-eyed god, [[Ame no Mahitotsu no Kami]] that people employed at iron smelting have put their faith into.\n\n==Cyclopia==\n{{main|Cyclopia}}\nThere is an inherited deformity called [[cyclopia]].

More than just abnormalities with the brain, nerves, or respiratory system, it is a condition that results in death in the womb before even birth. Vitamin A is, other than green vegetables, also contained in many animal foods, and in Japan, which did not have much of a culture in eating meat, it might not have been strange to be deficient in Vitamin A. With this background, since hitotsume-koz\u014d have the appearance of a child and the clothing of a young priest, it is thought that babies born with one eye were called this, which is where it started.<ref>{{Cite web|author=\u5c71\u7530\u654f\u4e4b|date=2007-06-29|url=http://www.sony-ef.or.jp/library/rakugo/2_ex.html|title=\u7b2c2\u56de \u300e\u4e00\u773c\u56fd\u300f\u3068\u8907\u773c\u601d\u8003 \u89e3\u8aac\u7de8|website=\u843d\u8a9e\u306b\u5b66\u3076 ([[Rakugo]] ni Manabu)|publisher=\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u6559\u80b2\u8ca1\u56e3|accessdate=2009-12-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110200707/http://www.sony-ef.or.jp/library/rakugo/2_ex.html|archivedate=2007-11-10}}</ref><ref name=\"\u307e\u3081\u3053\u305e\u3046\">{{Cite web|author=|date=2007-01-08|url=http://www.0462.net/blog/mamekozo/index.html?page=2133|title=\u307e\u3081\u3053\u305e\u3046\u306e\u65c5 \u5ea7\u9593\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u63a2\u691c \u7b2c34\u8a71 \u4e00\u3064\u76ee\u5c0f\u50e7\u5730\u8535|website=\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u5ea7\u9593\u304c\u3042\u308b 0462.net|publisher=\u5ea7\u9593\u5e02\u5546\u5e97\u4f1a\u9023\u5408\u4f1a|accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Zama, Kanagawa|Zama]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], in 1932 (Showa 7), a skull with only one eye socket was dug up from the cemetery inside the city, and it was presumed to have been the result of someone who was attacked by wild dogs after collapsing, and a \"Hitotsume-koz\u014d Jiz\u014d\" was constructed as a memorial for this, and afterwards people connected it with the legend of hitotsume-koz\u014d and conveyed between people.<ref>{{Cite book|author=\u5ea7\u9593\u5e02\u6587\u5316\u8ca1\u8abf\u67fb\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a\u57f7\u7b46\u7de8\u96c6|title=\u5ea7\u9593\u5e02\u6587\u5316\u8ca1\u8abf\u67fb\u5831\u544a\u66f8|year=1984|publisher=\u5ea7\u9593\u5e02\u6559\u80b2\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a|volume=\u7b2c9\u96c6|pages=96\u201397\u9801}}</ref> There is also the viewpoint that the owner of the skull had cyclopia.<ref name=\"\u307e\u3081\u3053\u305e\u3046\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cyclopes]]\n*[[List of legendary creatures from Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://hyakumonogatari.com/2012/03/12/tofu-kozo-the-tofu-boy/ T\u014dfu-koz\u014d \u2013 The Tofu Boy | \u767e\u7269\u8a9e\u602a\u8ac7\u4f1a Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai], by Mizuki Shigeru at hyakumonogatari.com\n*[http://en.gigazine.net/news/20081230_youkai_bronze/ 133 Yokai Statues on Mizuki Shigeru Road]; scroll down to see 84.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich.

The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

The FB trains operate largely in the street for this section of their route, sharing track with VBZ tram routes, but are categorised as route [[S18 (ZVV)|S18]] of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn railway network]] rather than as part of the tram network.

In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.<ref name=gpw>{{cite web | title = Gleisplan - Stra\u00dfenbahn Z\u00fcrich mit Glattal |  url = http://www.gleisplanweb.eu/Maps/Zuerich.pdf | language = German | trans-title = Trackplan - Z\u00fcrich with Glattal | date = 2014-01-23 | accessdate = 2014-06-21}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nMany of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided.

Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten.

All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network.

The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles.

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The line opened in 1912 as a rural tramway connecting at Rehalp with the city trams, with inter-running as far as the city centre. The line has since been rebuilt with more railway characteristics, and quite substantial trains, but these continue to operate across the city tram network between [[Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen railway station|Stadelhofen]] in the city centre and Rehalp.\n|-\n|'''[[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]]'''\n|VBZ\n|1950\n|\n|\n|Owned by city of Z\u00fcrich.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n|-\n|'''''[[BDWM Transport AG]]'''''\n|BDWM\n|2000\n|\n|\n|Created by amalgamation of the BD with the bus operator WM.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles. The ''Karpfen'' last ran in regular service in 2006, and the ''Mirage'' in 2010.

The tracks are electrified using [[overhead line]] at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], utilising a supply system shared with the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus network]].<ref name=\"figures\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/die_vbz/portraet/zahlen_fakten/linien.html |title=Startseite VBZ - Die VBZ - Portr\u00e4t - Zahlen & Fakten - Linien |publisher=Stadt Z\u00fcrich [City of Z\u00fcrich] |language=German |trans-title=Home VBZ - VBZ - Portrait - Facts & Figures - Lines |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nThe VBZ infrastructure within Z\u00fcrich is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic and significant sections where trams run in unrestricted traffic lanes. In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.<ref name=gpw>{{cite web | title = Gleisplan - Stra\u00dfenbahn Z\u00fcrich mit Glattal |  url = http://www.gleisplanweb.eu/Maps/Zuerich.pdf | language = German | trans-title = Trackplan - Z\u00fcrich with Glattal | date = 2014-01-23 | accessdate = 2014-06-21}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nMany of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided. In consequence all terminal locations are equipped with [[turning loop]]s, and all tram stops are to the [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]] of the tram.<ref name=gpw/>\n\n===Depots and workshops===\n[[File:Tramdepot Zuerich 1911 Friedrich Fissler.jpg|thumb|left|The tram depot at Hard was built in 1911]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram fleet is kept in the five operational depots of Hard, Irchel, Kalkbreite, Oerlikon and  Wollishofen, together with a permanent way yard at Hardturm. Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten.

Burgweis depot now houses the [[Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich]] main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.<ref name=gpw/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Tram fleet===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

Nephthys's association with the kite or the Egyptian hawk (and its piercing, mournful cries) evidently reminded the ancients of the lamentations usually offered for the dead by wailing women. In this capacity, it is easy to see how Nephthys could be associated with death and putrefaction in the [[Pyramid Texts]]. She was, almost without fail, depicted as crowned by the hieroglyphics signifying her name, which were a combination of signs for the sacred temple enclosure (''hwt''), along with the sign for ''neb'', or ''mistress (Lady)'',  on top of the enclosure sign.<ref>James P. Allen, Peter Der Manuelian, 'The Pyramid Texts' SBL, 2005</ref>\n\nNephthys was clearly viewed as a morbid-but-crucial force of heavenly transition, i.e., the Pharaoh becomes strong for his journey to the afterlife through the intervention of Isis and Nephthys. The same divine power could be applied later to all of the dead, who were advised to consider Nephthys a necessary companion. According to the [[Pyramid Texts]], Nephthys, along with Isis, was a force before whom demons trembled in fear, and whose magical spells were necessary for navigating the various levels of [[Duat]], as the region of the afterlife was termed.\n\n==Mythology and position in the Pantheon==\n===Nephthys and Set===\nThough it commonly has been assumed that Nephthys was married to [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and they have a son [[Anubis]], recent Egyptological research has called this into question.  Levai notes that while [[Plutarch]]'s ''De Iside et Osiride'' mentions the deity's marriage, there is very little specifically linking Nephthys and Set in the original early Egyptian sources.  She argues that the later evidence suggests that:\n\n<blockquote>while Nephthys's marriage to Set was a part of Egyptian mythology, it was not a part of the myth of the murder and resurrection of Osiris. She was not paired with Set the villain, but with Set's other aspect, the benevolent figure who was the killer of [[Apep|Apophis]]. This was the aspect of Set worshiped in the western oases during the Roman period, where he is depicted with Nephthys as co-ruler.<ref>Levai, Jessica.  \"Nephthys and Seth: Anatomy of a Mythical Marriage\", Paper presented at The 58th Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, Wyndham Toledo Hotel, Toledo, Ohio, Apr 20, 2007.[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p176897_index.html http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p176897_index.html]</ref></blockquote>\n\n\nIt is Nephthys who assists Isis in gathering and mourning the dismembered portions of the body of Osiris, after his murder by the envious Set. Nephthys also serves as the nursemaid and watchful guardian of the infant Horus. The [[Pyramid Texts]] refer to Isis as the \"birth-mother\" and to Nephthys as the \"nursing-mother\" of Horus.  Nephthys was attested as one of the four \"Great Chiefs\" ruling in the Osirian cult-center of Busiris, in the Delta<ref>The Book of the Dead, Theban Recension</ref> and she appears to have occupied an honorary position at the holy city of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. No cult is attested for her there, though she certainly figured as a goddess of great importance in the annual rites conducted, wherein two chosen females or priestesses played the roles of Isis and Nephthys and performed the elaborate 'Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys'. There, at Abydos, Nephthys joined Isis as a mourner in the shrine known as the Osireion.<ref>Byron Esely Shafer, Dieter Arnold, Temples in Ancient Egypt, p.&nbsp;112, 2005</ref> These \"[[Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys]]\" were ritual elements of many such Osirian rites in major ancient Egyptian cult-centers.\n\nAs a mortuary goddess like Isis, Neith, and Serqet, Nephthys was one of the protectresses of the [[Canopic jar]]s of the Hapi. Hapi, one of the [[Sons of Horus]], guarded the embalmed lungs.  Thus we find Nephthys endowed with the epithet, \"Nephthys of the Bed of Life\",<ref>Tomb of Tuthmosis III, Dynasty XVIII</ref> in direct reference to her regenerative priorities on the embalming table. In the city of Memphis, Nephthys was duly honored with the title \"Queen of the Embalmer's Shop\", and there associated with the [[jackal]]-headed god [[Anubis]] as patron.<ref>J. Berlandini, p. 41-62, Varia Memphitica, VI - La st\u00e8le de Par\u00e2herounemyef, BIFAO 82</ref>\n\nNephthys was also considered a festive deity whose rites could mandate the liberal consumption of beer. In various reliefs at Edfu, Dendera, and Behbeit, Nephthys is depicted receiving lavish beer-offerings from the Pharaoh, which she would \"return\", using her power as a beer-goddess \"that [the pharaoh] may have joy with no hangover\". Elsewhere at Edfu, for example, Nephthys is a goddess who gives the Pharaoh power to see \"that which is hidden by moonlight\". This fits well with more general textual themes that consider Nephthys to be a goddess whose unique domain was darkness, or the perilous edges of the desert.\n\nNephthys could also appear as one of the goddesses who assists at childbirth. An ancient Egyptian myth preserved in the [[Papyrus Westcar]] recounts the story of Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, and Heqet as traveling dancers in disguise, assisting the wife of a priest of Amun-Re as she prepares to bring forth sons who are destined for fame and fortune.\n\nNephthys's healing skills and status as direct counterpart of Isis, steeped, as her sister in \"words of power\", are evidenced by the abundance of [[Egyptian faience|faience]] amulets carved in her likeness, and by her presence in a variety of magical papyri that sought to summon her famously altruistic qualities to the aid of mortals.<ref>A. Gutbub, J. Bergman, Nephthys d\u00e9couverte dans un papyrus magique in M\u00e9langes, Publications de la recherche, universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Montpellier, FRANCE, 1984</ref>\n\n==New Kingdom cults==\n[[File:A mummy rests on a sacred boat guarded by Anubis.

From Egypt, 332 BCE to 395 CE. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, UK]]\nThe [[Ramesside]] Pharaohs were particularly devoted to Set's prerogatives and, in the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]], a temple of Nephthys called the \"House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\"  was built or refurbished in the town of [[Sepermeru]], midway between [[Oxyrhynchus|Oxyrhynchos]] and [[Herakleopolis]], on the outskirts of the [[Fayyum]] and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh. Here, as [[Papyrus Wilbour]] notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments, the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation by Ramesses II, located in close proximity to (or within) the precinct of the enclosure of Set. To be certain, the House of Nephthys was one of fifty individual, land-owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in [[Papyrus Wilbour]]. The fields and other holdings belonging to Nephthys's temple were under the authority of two Nephthys-prophets (named Penpmer and Merybarse) and one (mentioned) [[wa'ab]] priest of the goddess.\n\nWhile certainly affiliated with the \"House of Set\", the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands (several acres) clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution.<ref>'Land Tenure in the Ramesside Period' by S. Katary, 1989</ref> The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right, an independent entity. According to Papyrus Wilbour,<ref>Section 1. 28</ref> another \"House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\" seems to have existed to the north, in the town of Su, closer to the Fayyum region.\n\nAnother temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem. The [[Papyrus Bologna]] records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard. After making an introductory appeal to \"Re-Horakhte, Set, and Nephthys\" for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier, the prophet (named Pra'emhab) laments his workload. He notes his obvious administration of the \"House of Set\" and adds: \"I am also responsible for the ship, and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys, along with a heap of other temples.\"<ref>Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5, 8-7, 1</ref>\n\nAs \"Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\", the goddess and her shrines were under the particular endorsement of [[Ramesses II]]. The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru finally were discovered and identified in the 1980s, and the Nephthys temple was a self-sustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure.<ref>'Les Deesses de l'Egypte Pharaonique', R. LaChaud, 1992, Durocher-Champollion</ref>\n\nThere can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis, north of Sepermeru. A near life-sized statue of Nephthys (currently housed in the [[Louvre]]) boasts a curiously altered inscription. The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet-Habu, as part of the cultic celebration of the Pharaonic \"Sed-Festival\", but was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of [[Heryshaf|Herishef]]. The cult-image's inscription originally pertained to \"Nephthys, Foremost of the Sed [Festival] in the Booth of Annals\" (at Medinet-Habu), but was re-inscribed or re-dedicated to \"Nephthys, Foremost of the [Booths of] Herakleopolis\". A \"prophet of Nephthys\" is indeed attested for the town of Herakleopolis in the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|30th Dynasty]].<ref>Forgeau, 'Pretres Isiaques,' BIFAO 84, 155-157</ref>\n\n==Chief goddess of Nome VII==\nNephthys was considered the unique protectress of the Sacred Phoenix, or the [[Bennu]] Bird. This role may have stemmed from an early association in her native Heliopolis, which was renowned for its \"House of the Bennu\" temple. In this role, Nephthys was given the name \"Nephthys-Kheresket\", and a wealth of temple texts from Edfu, Dendera, Philae, Kom Ombo, El Qa'la, Esna, and others corroborate the late identification of Nephthys as the supreme goddess of Upper Egyptian Nome VII, where another shrine existed in honor of the [[Bennu]]. Nephthys also was the goddess of the \"Mansion of the [[Sistrum]]\" in Hwt-Sekhem (Gr. Diospolis Parva), the chief city of Nome VII. There, Nephthys was the primary protectress of the resident Osirian relic, of the Bennu Bird, and of the local Horus/Osiris manifestation, the god Neferhotep.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sauneron, Beitrage Bf. 6, 46; C.

Therefore, it should not surprise us that her cult images could likely be found as part of the divine entourage in temples at Kharga, Kellis, Deir el-Hagar, Koptos, Dendera, Philae, Sebennytos, Busiris, Shenhur, El Qa'la, Letopolis, Heliopolis, Abydos, Thebes, Dakleh Oasis, and indeed throughout Egypt.<ref>BIFAO website</ref> In most cases, Nephthys found her typical place as part of a triad alongside Osiris and Isis, or Isis and Horus, or Isis and Min, or as part of a quartet of deities.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture#Nephthys}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n{{Ancient Egyptian religion footer|collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Egyptian goddesses]]\n[[Category:Egyptian death goddesses]]\n[[Category:Sea and river goddesses]]\n[[Category:Night goddesses]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Egyptian deity}}\n{{For|the catworm virus|Nephtys}} \n{{Infobox deity\n| type        = Egyptian\n| name        = Nephthys\n| image       = Nepthys.svg\n| alt         = \n| caption     = Nephthys was normally portrayed as a young woman, wearing a headdress in the shape of a house and basket\n| hiro        = <hiero>O9 t:H8</hiero>\n| cult_center = None specifically, [[Diospolis Parva]]\n| symbol      = The house and mummy wrappings\n| parents     = [[Geb]] and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]\n| siblings    = [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Horus the Elder|Haroeris]], and [[Set (deity)|Set]]\n| consort     = [[Set (mythology)|Set]]\n| offspring   = [[Anubis]]\n}}\n\n'''Nephthys''' or '''Nebet-Het''' in Ancient Egyptian ({{lang-grc-gre|\u039d\u03ad\u03c6\u03b8\u03c5\u03c2}}) is a goddess in [[ancient Egyptian religion]].

As sister of [[Isis]] and especially [[Osiris]], Nephthys is a protective goddess who symbolizes the death experience, just as Isis represented the birth experience.\nNephthys was known in some ancient Egyptian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] theologies and cosmologies as the \"Helpful Goddess\" or the \"Excellent Goddess\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |first=P. |last=Wilson |title=A Ptolemaic Lexikon: A lexicographical study of the texts in the Temple of Edfu |series=OLA |volume=78 |year=1997}}</ref> These late Ancient Egyptian temple texts describe a goddess who represented divine assistance and protective guardianship.\n\nNephthys is regarded as the mother of the funerary-deity [[Anubis]] (Inpu) in some myths.<ref>{{cite journal |first=G.A. |last=Wainwright |title=Seshat and the Pharaoh |journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology |volume=26 |date=February 1941 |pages=30-40}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Virginia |last=Schomp |title=The Ancient Egyptians |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2007 |page=27}}</ref> Alternatively Anubis appears as the son of [[Bastet]]<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=A.K. |editor-last=Eyma |title=A Delta-man in Yebu |publisher=Universal Publishers |year=2003 |page=219 |article=On a topos in Egyptian medical history |first=Hedvig |last=Gy\u00f6ry}}</ref> or [[Isis]].<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Donald B. |last=Redford |title=The literary motif of the exposed child (cf.

Nephthys's association with the kite or the Egyptian hawk (and its piercing, mournful cries) evidently reminded the ancients of the lamentations usually offered for the dead by wailing women. In this capacity, it is easy to see how Nephthys could be associated with death and putrefaction in the [[Pyramid Texts]]. She was, almost without fail, depicted as crowned by the hieroglyphics signifying her name, which were a combination of signs for the sacred temple enclosure (''hwt''), along with the sign for ''neb'', or ''mistress (Lady)'',  on top of the enclosure sign.<ref>James P. Allen, Peter Der Manuelian, 'The Pyramid Texts' SBL, 2005</ref>\n\nNephthys was clearly viewed as a morbid-but-crucial force of heavenly transition, i.e., the Pharaoh becomes strong for his journey to the afterlife through the intervention of Isis and Nephthys. The same divine power could be applied later to all of the dead, who were advised to consider Nephthys a necessary companion. According to the [[Pyramid Texts]], Nephthys, along with Isis, was a force before whom demons trembled in fear, and whose magical spells were necessary for navigating the various levels of [[Duat]], as the region of the afterlife was termed.\n\n==Mythology and position in the Pantheon==\n===Nephthys and Set===\nThough it commonly has been assumed that Nephthys was married to [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and they have a son [[Anubis]], recent Egyptological research has called this into question.  Levai notes that while [[Plutarch]]'s ''De Iside et Osiride'' mentions the deity's marriage, there is very little specifically linking Nephthys and Set in the original early Egyptian sources.  She argues that the later evidence suggests that:\n\n<blockquote>while Nephthys's marriage to Set was a part of Egyptian mythology, it was not a part of the myth of the murder and resurrection of Osiris. She was not paired with Set the villain, but with Set's other aspect, the benevolent figure who was the killer of [[Apep|Apophis]]. This was the aspect of Set worshiped in the western oases during the Roman period, where he is depicted with Nephthys as co-ruler.<ref>Levai, Jessica.  \"Nephthys and Seth: Anatomy of a Mythical Marriage\", Paper presented at The 58th Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, Wyndham Toledo Hotel, Toledo, Ohio, Apr 20, 2007.[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p176897_index.html http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p176897_index.html]</ref></blockquote>\n\n\nIt is Nephthys who assists Isis in gathering and mourning the dismembered portions of the body of Osiris, after his murder by the envious Set. Nephthys also serves as the nursemaid and watchful guardian of the infant Horus. The [[Pyramid Texts]] refer to Isis as the \"birth-mother\" and to Nephthys as the \"nursing-mother\" of Horus.  Nephthys was attested as one of the four \"Great Chiefs\" ruling in the Osirian cult-center of Busiris, in the Delta<ref>The Book of the Dead, Theban Recension</ref> and she appears to have occupied an honorary position at the holy city of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. No cult is attested for her there, though she certainly figured as a goddess of great importance in the annual rites conducted, wherein two chosen females or priestesses played the roles of Isis and Nephthys and performed the elaborate 'Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys'. There, at Abydos, Nephthys joined Isis as a mourner in the shrine known as the Osireion.<ref>Byron Esely Shafer, Dieter Arnold, Temples in Ancient Egypt, p.&nbsp;112, 2005</ref> These \"[[Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys]]\" were ritual elements of many such Osirian rites in major ancient Egyptian cult-centers.\n\nAs a mortuary goddess like Isis, Neith, and Serqet, Nephthys was one of the protectresses of the [[Canopic jar]]s of the Hapi. Hapi, one of the [[Sons of Horus]], guarded the embalmed lungs.  Thus we find Nephthys endowed with the epithet, \"Nephthys of the Bed of Life\",<ref>Tomb of Tuthmosis III, Dynasty XVIII</ref> in direct reference to her regenerative priorities on the embalming table. In the city of Memphis, Nephthys was duly honored with the title \"Queen of the Embalmer's Shop\", and there associated with the [[jackal]]-headed god [[Anubis]] as patron.<ref>J. Berlandini, p. 41-62, Varia Memphitica, VI - La st\u00e8le de Par\u00e2herounemyef, BIFAO 82</ref>\n\nNephthys was also considered a festive deity whose rites could mandate the liberal consumption of beer. In various reliefs at Edfu, Dendera, and Behbeit, Nephthys is depicted receiving lavish beer-offerings from the Pharaoh, which she would \"return\", using her power as a beer-goddess \"that [the pharaoh] may have joy with no hangover\". Elsewhere at Edfu, for example, Nephthys is a goddess who gives the Pharaoh power to see \"that which is hidden by moonlight\". This fits well with more general textual themes that consider Nephthys to be a goddess whose unique domain was darkness, or the perilous edges of the desert.\n\nNephthys could also appear as one of the goddesses who assists at childbirth. An ancient Egyptian myth preserved in the [[Papyrus Westcar]] recounts the story of Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, and Heqet as traveling dancers in disguise, assisting the wife of a priest of Amun-Re as she prepares to bring forth sons who are destined for fame and fortune.\n\nNephthys's healing skills and status as direct counterpart of Isis, steeped, as her sister in \"words of power\", are evidenced by the abundance of [[Egyptian faience|faience]] amulets carved in her likeness, and by her presence in a variety of magical papyri that sought to summon her famously altruistic qualities to the aid of mortals.<ref>A. Gutbub, J. Bergman, Nephthys d\u00e9couverte dans un papyrus magique in M\u00e9langes, Publications de la recherche, universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Montpellier, FRANCE, 1984</ref>\n\n==New Kingdom cults==\n[[File:A mummy rests on a sacred boat guarded by Anubis.

From Egypt, 332 BCE to 395 CE. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, UK]]\nThe [[Ramesside]] Pharaohs were particularly devoted to Set's prerogatives and, in the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]], a temple of Nephthys called the \"House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\"  was built or refurbished in the town of [[Sepermeru]], midway between [[Oxyrhynchus|Oxyrhynchos]] and [[Herakleopolis]], on the outskirts of the [[Fayyum]] and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh. Here, as [[Papyrus Wilbour]] notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments, the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation by Ramesses II, located in close proximity to (or within) the precinct of the enclosure of Set. To be certain, the House of Nephthys was one of fifty individual, land-owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in [[Papyrus Wilbour]]. The fields and other holdings belonging to Nephthys's temple were under the authority of two Nephthys-prophets (named Penpmer and Merybarse) and one (mentioned) [[wa'ab]] priest of the goddess.\n\nWhile certainly affiliated with the \"House of Set\", the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands (several acres) clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution.<ref>'Land Tenure in the Ramesside Period' by S. Katary, 1989</ref> The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right, an independent entity. According to Papyrus Wilbour,<ref>Section 1. 28</ref> another \"House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\" seems to have existed to the north, in the town of Su, closer to the Fayyum region.\n\nAnother temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem. The [[Papyrus Bologna]] records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard. After making an introductory appeal to \"Re-Horakhte, Set, and Nephthys\" for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier, the prophet (named Pra'emhab) laments his workload. He notes his obvious administration of the \"House of Set\" and adds: \"I am also responsible for the ship, and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys, along with a heap of other temples.\"<ref>Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5, 8-7, 1</ref>\n\nAs \"Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\", the goddess and her shrines were under the particular endorsement of [[Ramesses II]]. The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru finally were discovered and identified in the 1980s, and the Nephthys temple was a self-sustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure.<ref>'Les Deesses de l'Egypte Pharaonique', R. LaChaud, 1992, Durocher-Champollion</ref>\n\nThere can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis, north of Sepermeru. A near life-sized statue of Nephthys (currently housed in the [[Louvre]]) boasts a curiously altered inscription. The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet-Habu, as part of the cultic celebration of the Pharaonic \"Sed-Festival\", but was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of [[Heryshaf|Herishef]]. The cult-image's inscription originally pertained to \"Nephthys, Foremost of the Sed [Festival] in the Booth of Annals\" (at Medinet-Habu), but was re-inscribed or re-dedicated to \"Nephthys, Foremost of the [Booths of] Herakleopolis\". A \"prophet of Nephthys\" is indeed attested for the town of Herakleopolis in the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|30th Dynasty]].<ref>Forgeau, 'Pretres Isiaques,' BIFAO 84, 155-157</ref>\n\n==Chief goddess of Nome VII==\nNephthys was considered the unique protectress of the Sacred Phoenix, or the [[Bennu]] Bird. This role may have stemmed from an early association in her native Heliopolis, which was renowned for its \"House of the Bennu\" temple. In this role, Nephthys was given the name \"Nephthys-Kheresket\", and a wealth of temple texts from Edfu, Dendera, Philae, Kom Ombo, El Qa'la, Esna, and others corroborate the late identification of Nephthys as the supreme goddess of Upper Egyptian Nome VII, where another shrine existed in honor of the [[Bennu]]. Nephthys also was the goddess of the \"Mansion of the [[Sistrum]]\" in Hwt-Sekhem (Gr. Diospolis Parva), the chief city of Nome VII. There, Nephthys was the primary protectress of the resident Osirian relic, of the Bennu Bird, and of the local Horus/Osiris manifestation, the god Neferhotep.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sauneron, Beitrage Bf. 6, 46; C.

Salle des offrandes 1 \u00e0 112</ref>\n\nNephthys was most widely and usually worshipped in ancient Egypt as part of a consortium of temple deities. Therefore, it should not surprise us that her cult images could likely be found as part of the divine entourage in temples at Kharga, Kellis, Deir el-Hagar, Koptos, Dendera, Philae, Sebennytos, Busiris, Shenhur, El Qa'la, Letopolis, Heliopolis, Abydos, Thebes, Dakleh Oasis, and indeed throughout Egypt.<ref>BIFAO website</ref> In most cases, Nephthys found her typical place as part of a triad alongside Osiris and Isis, or Isis and Horus, or Isis and Min, or as part of a quartet of deities.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture#Nephthys}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n{{Ancient Egyptian religion footer|collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Egyptian goddesses]]\n[[Category:Egyptian death goddesses]]\n[[Category:Sea and river goddesses]]\n[[Category:Night goddesses]]\n", "name_user": "2601:902:c280:1a40:648a:87a5:d235:42ec", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEtymology)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephthys"}

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]], and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the wider [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. It was the second of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThe conflict has been viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War]], which had concluded only two years before. After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1742)|Treaty of Berlin]] ended hostilities between Austria and Prussia in 1742, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s fortunes improved greatly in the continuing War of the Austrian Succession. As Austria expanded its alliances with the 1743 [[Treaty of Worms (1743)|Treaty of Worms]], Prussia entered a renewed alliance with Austria's enemies in the [[League of Frankfurt]] and rejoined the war, hoping to prevent a resurgent Austria from taking back Silesia.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of Habsburg Bohemia in mid-1744, and ended in a Prussian victory with the [[Treaty of Dresden]] in December 1745, which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. Continuing conflict over Silesia would draw Austria and Prussia into a [[Third Silesian War]] a decade later.

[[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict.

Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]], and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the wider [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. It was the second of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThe conflict has been viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War]], which had concluded only two years before. After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1742)|Treaty of Berlin]] ended hostilities between Austria and Prussia in 1742, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s fortunes improved greatly in the continuing War of the Austrian Succession. As Austria expanded its alliances with the 1743 [[Treaty of Worms (1743)|Treaty of Worms]], Prussia entered a renewed alliance with Austria's enemies in the [[League of Frankfurt]] and rejoined the war, hoping to prevent a resurgent Austria from taking back Silesia.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of Habsburg Bohemia in mid-1744, and ended in a Prussian victory with the [[Treaty of Dresden]] in December 1745, which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. Continuing conflict over Silesia would draw Austria and Prussia into a [[Third Silesian War]] a decade later.

[[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict.

Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone.
