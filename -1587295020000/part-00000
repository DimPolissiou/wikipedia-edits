Mobile devices are proving to increase political participation and are now even being portrayed as a voting gadget in even the [[least developed countries]].

In the 2019 London election, of 18-25 year olds 56% voted Labour and 21% Conservative. Although this cannot ever be wholly contributed to the backing of Corbyn by UK artists, the effect cannot be underestimated.

The largest use of bots is in web spidering, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/web_crawler.htm|title=Web crawler|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> This aids in the detection of bots as through qualitative coding, softwares can confirm the presence of bots. An example would be the Bot-a-meter developed by Indiana University, where they evaluate 7 different factors to determine whether or not an accounts is a bot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/|title=Botometer by OSoMe|website=botometer.iuni.iu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nA Sock Puppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127107-sock-puppet-accounts-unmasked-by-the-way-they-write-and-post/|title=Sock puppet accounts unmasked by the way they write and post|website=www.newscientist.com|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> The term originally referred to a false identity assumed by a member of an Internet community who is pretending to be another person. This includes other misleading uses of online identities, such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization, to manipulate public opinion, block evasion, ballot stuffing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postbulletin.com/opinion/our_view/our-view-bots-and-sockpuppets-are-deepening-the-political-divide/article_31fbbd42-1745-11e8-baec-db909ca5572d.html|title=Our View: Bots and sockpuppets are deepening the political divide|website=PostBulletin.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> There is significant evidence to indicate that the [[Internet Research Agency]], a group of professional Russian Trolls, created fake accounts on major networking sites, online newspapers, to promote specific Ukrainian, Middle Eastern, and American political issues, even advocating for Trump as early as December 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/23/troll-steven-poole-word-of-week|title=What's the difference between a troll and a sockpuppet?|last=Poole|first=Steven|date=2018-02-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==== Ease of manipulation ====\nCitizens involved in politics have developed a sense of security amongst the physical attending of a polling place or submitting their vote through mail. Like many physical experiences, they also have a digital counterpart. In areas such as the United States, [[Electronic voting|online voting]] have been developing in the form of smartphone applications or secure websites. Online voting allows more citizens to exercise their right to vote by breaking down the physical barrier that may keep a voter from voting.\n\nAs an unwanted result, online voting is easier to manipulate. Social media apps such as [[Instagram]] or [[Facebook]] have taken the initiative to get people registered and motivated to go and vote. Despite their efforts, there are social media account engineered to misinform the public causing a jaded perspective in electable candidates or understanding of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/05/13/publics-think-technology-impacts-the-political-environment-in-both-positive-and-negative-ways/|title=People think technology impacts politics positively and negatively|last=NW|first=1615 L.

In the 2016 U.S. election, [[Alex Halderman|J.

Official users of the application suffered from reporting issues, leading to incomplete data, and a bottleneck during transmission. President of [[Verified Voting Foundation|Verified Voting]], Marian Schneider released a statement that says,<blockquote>\"The situation with Iowa's caucus reveals the risks associated with technology, in this case with a mobile app, but more importantly that there needs to be a low-tech solution in order to recover from technological failures -- no matter the cause, There needs to be a way to monitor, detect, respond and recover.

It was a term first used at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2014. The basic concept of [[leapfrogging]] is that small and incremental innovations lead allow radical innovations with new firms or countries to \"leapfrog\" old and ancient ones, including with different governmental institutions and ideas. Countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later.\n\n==== Tunisia ====\nAn example of this is the new [[Tunisia|Tunsia]] constitution. Learning from America and other countries, Tunisia developed a constitution that provides more rights that typical constitutions with issues concerning climate change, healthcare, women's rights, and workers' rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/4-ways-tunisia-is-now-more-progressive-than-the-united-states-9879ae93d105/|title=4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> They have provided rights that the United States' government does not cover for its citizens. Tunisia has set the stage for many other countries to follow in their footsteps including Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Although these countries' attempts at democracies have not been nearly as successful as Tunisia's constitution.\n\n==== Estonia ====\nAnother example of a Leapfrog democracy is Estonia being one of the first countries to use online voting. Nearly 99% of their public services are available online, and a reported 44% of Estonia citizens use the online services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting/|title=i-Voting|website=e-Estonia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> [[Electronic voting in Estonia|Electronic Voting in Estonia]] has been occurring since 2005 and can cast votes through an app on their mobile device.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/06/07/how-estonias-e-voting-system-could-be-the-future/|title=How Estonia's E-Voting System Could Be The Future|last=Leetaru|first=Kalev|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Through Estonia's national ID infrastructure, National ID cards have the ability to perform cryptographic functions to authenticate their access to different websites and make legally binding signatures on documents if needed. These cards work through the use of two different RSA key pairs. However, there are still some drawbacks of this voting process as there are inadequate procedural controls that change several times or are not followed, lax operational security, and insufficient transparency. These weaknesses can allow for client side attacks on the voting system.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Springall|first=Drew|chapter=Security Analysis of the Estonian Internet Voting System|title= CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security |year=2014|pages=703\u2013715|doi=10.1145/2660267.2660315|isbn=9781450329576}}</ref>\n\n== Presence of online tools for political participation ==\n\nWith the increasing use of technology in the political sphere, many new platforms have emerged in an attempt to provide unbiased information to the general public in a manner that is accessible  to all. The idea of spreading unbiased information has become a popular platform for many apps to get started on. Many of these apps hope to be able to spread this information so that voters may be more educated about the political sphere and make more of an informed decisions when voting.<ref name=\"Armstrong\"/> Some more examples include Liquid.us, Countable,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.countable.us/|title=Contact your Reps, Influence Congress, Vote on Bills|website=www.countable.us|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Capitol Bells,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitolbells.com/splash/|title=Capitol Bells|website=www.capitolbells.com|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Fiscalnote,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fiscalnote.com/|title=Homepage|website=FiscalNote|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> and Councilmatic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://councilmatic.org/|title=Councilmatic - Your local city council, demystified|last=|website=Councilmatic|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Technology is progressing rapidly to making a significant impact on our future campaigns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/study-groups/technology-innovation-and-politics-led-sonal-shah|title=Technology, Innovation and Politics led by Sonal Shah|website=The Institute of Politics at Harvard University|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> A [[comparison of civic technology platforms]] highlights the similarities and differences between different online tools used for political participation.\n\n==== PopVox ====\nAn example of this is PopVox, as they provide a holistic view of every bill and resolution that has passed or is currently in discussion with our government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popvox.com/|title=Your direct connection to lawmakers|website=www.popvox.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Popvox also provides a platform for voters to share their opinions on different bills being discussed in Congress at the moment, and from the start of the app over 350,000 people have used the app from across the country to share their opinions on bills and become more informed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahmckinney/2014/02/01/the-future-of-political-engagement-is-here-and-its-called-popvox/|title=The Future Of Political Engagement Is Here (And It's Called POPVOX)|last=McKinney|first=Sarah|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>\n\n==== iSideWith ====\niSideWith is an application that seeks to provide voters with a more educated guess of who they would politically side with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isidewith.com/|title=America's most popular voting guide for elections, political issues, candidates, and poll data|website=iSideWith|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> They have an in-depth survey on their website that asks about the users' political opinion on common issues discussed or debated within the government currently to give the voter a ranking of which politician best aligns with what stance they have on the current political sphere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz|title=2019 Political Quiz|website=iSideWith|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> This gives voters more of an educated guess of who they should be casting their vote for.

The largest use of bots is in web spidering, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/web_crawler.htm|title=Web crawler|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> This aids in the detection of bots as through qualitative coding, softwares can confirm the presence of bots.

In areas such as the United States, [[Electronic voting|online voting]] have been developing in the form of smartphone applications or secure websites. Online voting allows more citizens to exercise their right to vote by breaking down the physical barrier that may keep a voter from voting.\n\nAs an unwanted result, online voting is easier to manipulate. Social media apps such as [[Instagram]] or [[Facebook]] have taken the initiative to get people registered and motivated to go and vote. Despite their efforts, there are social media account engineered to misinform the public causing a jaded perspective in electable candidates or understanding of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/05/13/publics-think-technology-impacts-the-political-environment-in-both-positive-and-negative-ways/|title=People think technology impacts politics positively and negatively|last=NW|first=1615 L.

In the 2016 U.S. election, [[Alex Halderman|J.

It was a term first used at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2014. The basic concept of [[leapfrogging]] is that small and incremental innovations lead allow radical innovations with new firms or countries to \"leapfrog\" old and ancient ones, including with different governmental institutions and ideas. Countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later.\n\n==== Tunisia ====\nAn example of this is the new [[Tunisia|Tunsia]] constitution. Learning from America and other countries, Tunisia developed a constitution that provides more rights that typical constitutions with issues concerning climate change, healthcare, women's rights, and workers' rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/4-ways-tunisia-is-now-more-progressive-than-the-united-states-9879ae93d105/|title=4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> They have provided rights that the United States' government does not cover for its citizens. Tunisia has set the stage for many other countries to follow in their footsteps including Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Although these countries' attempts at democracies have not been nearly as successful as Tunisia's constitution.\n\n==== Estonia ====\nAnother example of a Leapfrog democracy is Estonia being one of the first countries to use online voting.

The website displays past successful petitions that have made an impact and the petition does not necessarily have to be related to politics as well.

Specifically having a section about Internet Voting, they speak about the dangers and information leaks that come with using the internet or anything digital to cast votes, even with blockchain. Verified Voting defines internet voting to even include email or fax voting or any voting through an online portal. This is due to the fact that any form of electronic voting can cause the vote to be susceptible to a large number of security threats including cyber-attacks that can skew voting results and preferences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/|title=Internet Voting {{!}} Verified Voting|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> According to NIST, it is difficult to make sure that votes are coming from verified and registered voters and it has not been changed in transit.

Prior to the opening of the school, students from those communities had attended [[Southern Regional School District]] in the [[Manahawkin, New Jersey|Manahawkin]] section of [[Stafford Township, New Jersey|Stafford Township]], which had been dealing for years with overcrowding.<ref>[https://www.srsd.net/AboutUs/BriefHistory The History of SRHS], [[Southern Regional School District]]. Accessed January 22, 2020. \"But eventually the high school had to go into split sessions due to over-crowding again. That problem was finally solved in 1979 with the opening of Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton. All mainland students south of Manahawkin would no longer be attending Southern Regional.\"</ref>\n\nThe building originally held grades 7-8 on the third floor, 9-10 on the second, and 11-12 on the first. The building featured an experimental \"[[open classroom]]\" design, where a large group of students of varying skill levels would be in a single, large classroom with several teachers overseeing them; and contained no interior walls. However, this format didn't last long, and in the 1980s, the rooms were walled off and separated by floor-to-ceiling folding partitions.\n\nIn 1991, Pinelands Middle School opened across the street for students in grades 7-8. Also in the 1990s, a new building was completed next to the high school, which houses a daycare center called \"Rainbow Express\". Students taking childcare classes attend class in this building to help with the daycare kids. In 2002, the Middle School was expanded and the 9th grade was moved there. When the expansion was completed at the Middle School, it was renamed \"Pinelands Regional Junior High School\" while the high school was formally renamed the \"Senior High School\".\n\nIn 2017, voters approved a bond referendum for renovations to both schools, including new roofing, bathrooms, new masonry in the High School building, and other cosmetic and safety upgrades. Renovation work on the High School was halted after workers discovered [[asbestos]] and roofing nails dislodged in the commons area. The high school building was closed for the entirety of the 2018-2019 school year while renovations were completed; [[portable classrooms]] were installed at the junior high school to accommodate five grades of students, while 7th graders attended the nearby Frog Pond Elementary School.<ref>Lowe, Claire.

Most of the cast and crew is made up of students who take the class as an elective. The channel shows live morning announcements at 7:32am daily, followed by a commercial or short skit made by members of the WCAT class. Throughout the day, especially during lunch periods, other school programs or past school events are shown on the channel, usually shown on TVs in the cafeteria.

Student chaperones from 9th grade and up are assigned to chaperone students.

Prior to the opening of the school, students from those communities had attended [[Southern Regional School District]] in the [[Manahawkin, New Jersey|Manahawkin]] section of [[Stafford Township, New Jersey|Stafford Township]], which had been dealing for years with overcrowding.<ref>[https://www.srsd.net/AboutUs/BriefHistory The History of SRHS], [[Southern Regional School District]]. Accessed Januay 22, 2020. \"But eventually the high school had to go into split sessions due to over-crowding again. That problem was finally solved in 1979 with the opening of Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton. All mainland students south of Manahawkin would no longer be attending Southern Regional.\"</ref>\n\nThe building originally held grades 7-8 on the third floor, 9-10 on the second, and 11-12 on the first. The building featured an experimental \"[[open classroom]]\" design, where a large group of students of varying skill levels would be in a single, large classroom with several teachers overseeing them; and contained no interior walls. However, this format didn't last long, and in the 1980s, the rooms were walled off and separated by floor-to-ceiling folding partitions.\n\nIn 1991, Pinelands Middle School opened across the street for students in grades 7-8. Also in the 1990s, a new building was completed next to the high school, which houses a daycare center called \"Rainbow Express\". Students taking childcare classes attend class in this building to help with the daycare kids. In 2002, the Middle School was expanded and the 9th grade was moved there. When the expansion was completed at the Middle School, it was renamed \"Pinelands Regional Junior High School\" while the high school was formally renamed the \"Senior High School\".\n\nIn 2017, voters approved a bond referendum for renovations to both schools, including new roofing, bathrooms, new masonry in the High School building, and other cosmetic and safety upgrades. Renovation work on the High School was halted after workers discovered [[asbestos]] and roofing nails dislodged in the commons area. The high school building was closed for the entirety of the 2018-2019 school year while renovations were completed; [[portable classrooms]] were installed at the junior high school to accommodate five grades of students, while 7th graders attended the nearby Frog Pond Elementary School.<ref>Lowe, Claire.

He was the first Indonesian governor of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], serving between 1950 and 1955, and was an early proponent of Moluccan inclusion in the Indonesian state.\n\nLatuharhary was born in [[Saparua]] and moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to pursue higher education, before receiving a scholarship to study at [[Leiden University]]. Upon his return, he worked as a judge in [[East Java]] and began participating in the Indonesian nationalist movement through the Ambonese diaspora association ''Sarekat Ambon''. He later resigned and became an advocate and politician, merging the ''Sarekat'' with the mainstream movement of Indonesian nationalism after initial rifts caused by the issue of religion in politics. Latuharhary moved to [[Jakarta]] and worked under the Department of Home Affairs during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] to manage Moluccans in Java, being arrested three times for different reasons. He took part in the initial drafting of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] through his membership of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence|BPUPKI]] and [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence|PPKI]], where he unsuccessfully championed [[federalism]] and opposed the inclusion of religion in government through the [[Jakarta Charter]] and later opposing the formation of the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]].\n\nFollowing the [[proclamation of Indonesian independence|proclamation of independence]], he was appointed [[Governor of Maluku]], but could not take power and instead organized Moluccans in Java to join the revolutionary cause. He was for some time part of the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] leadership and he participated in the Indonesian delegations of the [[Renville Agreement|Renville]] and the [[Roem\u2013van Roijen Agreement]]s. He eventually took office in 1950, where he attempted to establish the government and rebuild the ruined city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], before he was removed from his post. He died on 8 November 1959.\n\n==Early life and education==\nLatuharhary was born in [[Ullath]], [[Saparua]] on 6 July 1900, from the couple of Jan Latuharhary and Josefin Hiarej. Jan was a school teacher in the neighboring village. Johannes initially studied at the local first grade school in Saparua which taught students [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but he later moved to [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] at the age of 9 to study at a ''[[Europeesche Lagere School]]'' there. Though the school was primarily designated for Europeans, Johannes was admitted as his father was a teacher. He studied there until 1917,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=1\u20133}} before he moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] for higher education. He graduated from Batavia's [[Hogere Burgerschool]] in 1923.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=7}}\n\nHe later received a scholarship from the ''Ambonsch Studiefonds'' to study at the [[Leiden University]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=11}} Latuharhary became the first [[Moluccans|Moluccan]] to receive a [[Master of Laws#Types of LL.M. degrees|Meester in de Rechten]] (Master of Law) degree from Leiden in June 1927. Throughout his time at Leiden, Latuharhary did not directly participate within the student organization [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]] (PI), but he had significant interactions with its members and is often considered as a member due to his connections with PI leaders such as [[Ali Sastroamidjojo]] and [[Iwa Kusumasumantri]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}} When Latuharhary returned home, he had become a proponent of Indonesian nationalism and unity.{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n==Career==\n===Dutch East Indies===\nFollowing his return to the Indies, Latuharhary (who had secured a recommendation letter from his professor [[Cornelis van Vollenhoven]]) was hired as an assistant at [[Surabaya]]'s High Court,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=32}} and he was later promoted to a judge there before being appointed chief judge in the district court at Kraksaan (in what is today [[Probolinggo Regency]]) in 1929.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=45}} He also joined the ''Sarekat Ambon''/SA (Ambon Association) and worked on its reorganization.

He was the first Indonesian governor of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], serving between 1950 and 1955, and was an early proponent of Moluccan inclusion in the Indonesian state.\n\nLatuharhary was born in [[Saparua]] and moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to pursue higher education, before receiving a scholarship to study at [[Leiden University]]. Upon his return, he worked as a judge in [[East Java]] and began participating in the Indonesian nationalist movement through the Ambonese diaspora association ''Sarekat Ambon''. He later resigned and became an advocate and politician, merging the ''Sarekat'' with the mainstream movement of Indonesian nationalism after initial rifts caused by the issue of religion in politics. Latuharhary moved to [[Jakarta]] and worked under the Department of Home Affairs during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] to manage Moluccans in Java, being arrested three times for different reasons. He took part in the initial drafting of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] through his membership of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence|BPUPKI]] and [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence|PPKI]], where he unsuccessfully championed [[federalism]] and opposed the inclusion of religion in government through the [[Jakarta Charter]] and later opposing the formation of the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]].\n\nFollowing the [[proclamation of Indonesian independence|proclamation of independence]], he was appointed [[Governor of Maluku]], but could not take power and instead organized Moluccans in Java to join the revolutionary cause. He was for some time part of the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] leadership and he participated in the Indonesian delegations of the [[Renville Agreement|Renville]] and the [[Roem\u2013van Roijen Agreement]]s. He eventually took office in 1950, where he attempted to establish the government and rebuild the ruined city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], before he was removed from his post. He died on 8 November 1959.\n\n==Early life and education==\nLatuharhary was born in [[Ullath]], [[Saparua]] on 6 July 1900, from the couple of Jan Latuharhary and Josefin Hiarej. Jan was a school teacher in the neighboring village. Johannes initially studied at the local first grade school in Saparua which taught students [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but he later moved to [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] at the age of 9 to study at a ''[[Europeesche Lagere School]]'' there. Though the school was primarily designated for Europeans, Johannes was admitted as his father was a teacher. He studied there until 1917,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=1\u20133}} before he moved to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] for higher education. He graduated from Batavia's [[Hogere Burgerschool]] in 1923.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=7}}\n\nHe later received a scholarship from the ''Ambonsch Studiefonds'' to study at the [[Leiden University]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=11}} Latuharhary became the first [[Moluccans|Moluccan]] to receive a [[Master of Laws#Types of LL.M. degrees|Meester in de Rechten]] (Master of Law) degree from Leiden in June 1927. Throughout his time at Leiden, Latuharhary did not directly participate within the student organization [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]] (PI), but he had significant interactions with its members and is often considered as a member due to his connections with the PI's leaders such as [[Ali Sastroamidjojo]] and [[Iwa Kusumasumantri]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}} When Latuharhary returned home, he had become a proponent of Indonesian nationalism and unity.{{sfn|Elson|2008|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n==Career==\n===Dutch East Indies===\nFollowing his return to the Indies, Latuharhary (who had secured a recommendation letter from his professor [[Cornelis van Vollenhoven]]) was hired as an assistant at [[Surabaya]]'s High Court,{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=32}} and he was later promoted to a judge there before being appointed chief judge in the district court at Kraksaan (in what is today [[Probolinggo Regency]]) in 1929.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=45}} He also joined the ''Sarekat Ambon''/SA (Ambon Association) and worked on its reorganization. He was also assigned as the chief editor of SA's official newspaper ''Haloean'',{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=34}} and applied for SA to be granted legal status in 1930, though it did not receive it until 1933.{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|pp=137\u2013138}} Latuharhary also formed trade [[cooperative]] for Moluccans in response to the economic hardships from the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=44}}\n\nSeveral members of the SA had proposed for the organization to join the [[Association of Political Organisations of the Indonesian People]] (PPPKI), which consisted of various nationalist and local organizations such as the [[Indonesian National Party]], [[Sarekat Islam]] and [[Budi Utomo]]. Latuharhary was, however, opposed to the inclusion of religious organizations in political movements, and SA did not join the PPPKI initially.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=34}} Eventually, however, in SA's third congress in early 1932, the leadership made the decision to join PPPKI.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=43}} Latuharhary had previously participated in PPPKI's congress in January 1932, where he delivered his [[preamble]] ''Azab Sengsara Kepoelauan Maloekoe'' (Suffering of the Mollucas) which described economic devastation by the [[Dutch East India Company]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=48\u201349}} He also wrote that the Dutch education system for the Moluccans was geared towards creating \"scribes and clerks, soldiers and sailors\".{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=145}}\n\nThroughout this time, Latuharhary had leaned towards a more [[federalism|federalist]] structure for the future Indonesian state, in accordance to others such as [[Sam Ratulangi]], [[Tan Malaka]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]].{{sfn|Elson|2008|p=68}} In 1932, his preamble was published as a book, though it was censured by the colonial government. He later resigned from being chief judge following an ultimatum from the colonial government to pick between his job or being part of the nationalist movement, and he became a lawyer instead.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=50\u201351}} As an advocate, one of his first cases was suing sugar factories for taking over local farmers' land. Latuharhary won the case and gained local renown in East Java, and he was elected a member of the ''Regentschapsraad'' (municipal council) of Kraksaan. Latuharhary moved with his family to [[Malang]] in 1934 and later was elected to East Java's ''Provinciale Raad'' (provincial council). He was a member of the council until 1942.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Manus et al.|1993|pp=12-13}}\n\nLatuharhary was later named as chairman of the ''Jong Ambon'' (Ambon Youth) upon the organization's founding in 1936.{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=55}} In 1939, Latuharhary ran for a seat in the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], campaigning in Ambon. Throughout the campaigns, Latuharhary spread his nationalist views and setup or restores several SA branches. In the end, he lost to a candidate from the ''Regentenbond'' (nobles' association).{{sfn|Chauvel|2008|p=151}} He later joined [[Great Indonesia Party|Parindra]].{{sfn|Nanulaitta|1982|p=56}}\n\n===Japanese occupation and early independence===\nFollowing the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese invasion and takeover]], Latuharhary alongside other Parindra leaders were arrested and imprisoned.

Iztacc\u00edhuatl was falsely told that Popocat\u00e9petl had died in battle, and believing the news, she died of grief.  When Popocat\u00e9petl returned to find his love dead, he took her body to a spot outside [[Tenochtitlan]] and kneeled by her grave. The gods covered them with snow and changed them into mountains.  Iztacc\u00edhuatl's mountain is called \"White Woman\" (from Nahuatl {{wikt-lang|nci|izt\u0101c}} \"white\" and {{wikt-lang|nci|cihu\u0101tl}} \"woman\") because it resembles a woman lying on her back, and is often covered with snow\u2009\u2014\u2009the peak is sometimes nicknamed ''{{lang|es|La Mujer Dormida}}'', \"The Sleeping Woman\".

Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of

The city is also used as a base from which to explore the rest of Tasmania.\n\nThe last 15\u201320 years has seen Hobart's wine industry thrive as many vineyards have developed in countryside areas outside of the city in the Coal River Wine Region and [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]], including [[Moorilla Estate]] at [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale]] one of the most awarded vineyards in Australia.\n\n===Antarctic bases===\nHobart is an Antarctic gateway city, with geographical proximity to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Infrastructure is provided by the port of Hobart for scientific research and cruise ships, and [[Hobart International Airport]] supports an Antarctic Airlink to Wilkins Runway at [[Casey Station]]. Hobart is a logistics point for the French icebreaker [[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|''L'Astrolabe'']].\n\nHobart is the home port for the Australian and French Antarctic programs, and provides port services for other visiting Antarctic nations and Antarctic cruise ships. Antarctic and Southern Ocean expeditions are supported by a specialist cluster offering cold climate products, services and scientific expertise. The majority of these businesses and organisations are members of the [[Tasmanian polar network]], supported in part by the Tasmanian State Government.\n\nTasmania has a high concentration of Antarctic and Southern Ocean scientists.

Indeed, many descriptions of Hobart have used the phrase \"nestled amidst the foothills\", so undulating is the landscape. At 1,271 metres, the mountain has its own ecosystems, is rich in biodiversity and plays a large part in determining the local weather.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe [[Tasman Bridge]] is also a uniquely important feature of the city, connecting the two shores of Hobart and visible from many locations. The [[Hobart Synagogue]] is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest synagogue in Australia]] and a rare surviving example of an [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogue.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Hobart Tasmania (32575994875).jpg|thumb|right|Former Bank of Australasia Building, heritage listed for its significance as an Inter-War commercial building]]\nHobart is known for its well-preserved Colonial architecture, much of it dating back to the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] eras, giving the city a distinctly \"[[Old World]]\" feel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Content-Area Vocabulary Strategies for Language Arts|year=2002|publisher=Walch Publishing |page=39 |isbn=0-82514337-3}}</ref> For locals, this became a source of discomfiture about the city's convict past, but is now a draw card for tourists.<ref>Clark, J. \"This Southern Outpost, Hobart 1846\u20131914\" pp. 1</ref> Regions within the city centre, such as [[Salamanca Place]], contain many of the city's heritage-listed buildings.

Completed in 1840, it was used as Tasmania's parliament house, and is now commemorated by a pub bearing the same name (built in 1844) which is frequented by yachtsmen after they have completed the [[Sydney to Hobart yacht race]].\n\nHobart is also home to many historic churches. The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834 to 1836, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847.

The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] on the Eastern Shore. A new team, [[Hobart Hurricanes]] represent the city in the [[Big Bash League]]. [[Bellerive Oval]] has been the breeding ground of some world class cricket players including the former Australia captain [[Ricky Ponting]].\n\nDespite [[Australian rules football]]'s huge popularity in the state of Tasmania, the state does not have a team in the [[Australian Football League]]. However, a [[Tasmanian AFL bid|bid for an Tasmanian AFL team]] is a popular topic among football fans. The State government is one of the potential sponsors of such a team. Local domestic club football is still played. [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian State League]] football features five clubs from Hobart, and other leagues such as [[Southern Football League (Tasmania)|Southern Football League]] and the Old Scholars Football Association are also played each Winter.\n\nThe city has two local [[rugby league]] football teams (Hobart Tigers and South Hobart Storm) that compete in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]].\n\nTasmania is not represented by teams in the [[National Rugby League|NRL]], [[Super Rugby]], [[ANZ Championship]], [[A-League]], or [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]].

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.\n\nFerry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service \u2013 leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|left|MONA ROMA ferry in the Port of Hobart]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100&nbsp;million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]]. This upgrade was, in part, funded under a promise made during the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] by the Abbott government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/airport-runway-extension-works-under-way/news-story/6c6c0bbbfa533ce4b487b32956d37600|title=Airport works under way|access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{See also|Category:People from Hobart}}\n\n===Arts===\n[[File:Errol Flynn1.jpg|200px|thumb|Actor [[Errol Flynn]] was born in Hobart in 1909.]]\n\n* [[Asta (musician)|Asta]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Phillip Borsos]], best known for his films ''[[The Mean Season]]'' (1985) and ''[[One Magic Christmas]]'' (1985)\n* [[Essie Davis]], actress\n* [[Richard Flanagan]], author\n* [[Errol Flynn]], Hollywood actor\n* [[Frederick Frith]], painter and photographer\n* [[Lisa Gormley]], English-born Australian actress best known for playing [[Bianca Scott]] on the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] serial drama ''[[Home and Away]]''\n* [[Lucky Grills]], best known for portraying the unconventional detective \"Bluey\" Hills in the television series ''[[Bluey (TV series)|Bluey]]'' in 1976.\n* [[Robert Grubb]], actor\n* [[John Harwood (writer)|John Harwood]], writer and poet\n* [[Ernest Higgins|Ernest]], [[Tasman Higgins|Tasman]] and [[Arthur Higgins]], brothers and pioneering [[cinematographer]]s during the [[silent era]]\n* [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], Australian classical composer\n* [[William Kermode]], artist\n* [[Constantine Koukias]], a Greek-Australian composer and [[flautist]]\n* [[Louise Lovely]], the first Australian motion picture actress to find success in Hollywood\n* [[Dennis Miller (Australian actor)|Dennis Miller]], actor best known for his recurring role on ''[[Blue Heelers]]'' as Ex-Sergeant [[List of recurring Blue Heelers characters#Pat Doyle|Pat Doyle]] (1994\u20132000).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588223/|title=Dennis Miller (II)|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]], most noted for playing the long-running role of Terry Sullivan in the Australian television series [[The Sullivans]].\n* [[Tara Morice]], actress\n* [[Gerda Nicolson]], actress\n* [[Glenn Richards]], musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist with [[Augie March]]\n* [[Brian Ritchie]], musician, bassist of [[Violent Femmes]]\n* [[Clive Sansom]], poet and playwright\n* [[Don Sharp]], actor\n* [[Michael Siberry]], actor\n* [[Jaason Simmons]], actor best known for his role as life guard [[Logan Fowler]] in the TV series ''[[Baywatch]]''\n* [[Freya Stafford]], actress who has appeared on TV programs such as ''[[Head Start (TV series)|Head Start]]'' and ''[[White Collar Blue]]'' and the 2010 horror film, ''[[The Clinic (2010 film)|The Clinic]]''\n* [[Amali Ward#Amali Ward|Amali Ward]], ''[[Australian Idol (season 2)|Australian Idol]]'' Season 2 finalist\n* [[Charles A.

Geologically Hobart is built predominantly on Jurassic [[Diabase|dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic siltstone and Permian mudstone. Hobart extends along both sides of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]; on the western shore from the Derwent valley in the north through the flatter areas of [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] which rests on older Triassic sediment and into the hilly areas of New Town, Lenah Valley. Both of these areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, in the Derwent estuary. South of the Derwent estuary lies Storm Bay and the [[Tasman Peninsula]].\n\nThe Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent valley area in a southerly direction hugging the Meehan Range in the east before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger deposits from the Quaternary. From there the city extends in an easterly direction through the [[Meehan Range]] into the hilly areas of Rokeby and Oakdowns, before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]].\n\nHobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself; Sandy Bay, Cornelian Bay, Nutgrove, Kingston, Bellerive, and Howrah Beaches as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as; Seven Mile, Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton, and Goats Beaches.\n\n[[File:Greater Hobart Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|centre|Hobart area from [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nHobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|\u00b0C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|\u22122.8|\u00b0C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name=\"BoM\"/> Annually, Hobart receives 40.8 clear days.

Mountain snow covering has also been known to occur during the other seasons. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 15 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to cold air masses arriving from Antarctica coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales.\n\n[[File:Panorama of

The city is also used as a base from which to explore the rest of Tasmania.\n\nThe last 15\u201320 years has seen Hobart's wine industry thrive as many vineyards have developed in countryside areas outside of the city in the Coal River Wine Region and [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]], including [[Moorilla Estate]] at [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale]] one of the most awarded vineyards in Australia.\n\n===Antarctic bases===\nHobart is an Antarctic gateway city, with geographical proximity to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Infrastructure is provided by the port of Hobart for scientific research and cruise ships, and [[Hobart International Airport]] supports an Antarctic Airlink to Wilkins Runway at [[Casey Station]]. Hobart is a logistics point for the French icebreaker [[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|''L'Astrolabe'']].\n\nHobart is the home port for the Australian and French Antarctic programs, and provides port services for other visiting Antarctic nations and Antarctic cruise ships. Antarctic and Southern Ocean expeditions are supported by a specialist cluster offering cold climate products, services and scientific expertise. The majority of these businesses and organisations are members of the [[Tasmanian polar network]], supported in part by the Tasmanian State Government.\n\nTasmania has a high concentration of Antarctic and Southern Ocean scientists.

Indeed, many descriptions of Hobart have used the phrase \"nestled amidst the foothills\", so undulating is the landscape. At 1,271 metres, the mountain has its own ecosystems, is rich in biodiversity and plays a large part in determining the local weather.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe [[Tasman Bridge]] is also a uniquely important feature of the city, connecting the two shores of Hobart and visible from many locations. The [[Hobart Synagogue]] is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest synagogue in Australia]] and a rare surviving example of an [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogue.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Hobart Tasmania (32575994875).jpg|thumb|right|Former Bank of Australasia Building, heritage listed for its significance as an Inter-War commercial building]]\nHobart is known for its well-preserved Colonial architecture, much of it dating back to the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] eras, giving the city a distinctly \"[[Old World]]\" feel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Content-Area Vocabulary Strategies for Language Arts|year=2002|publisher=Walch Publishing |page=39 |isbn=0-82514337-3}}</ref> For locals, this became a source of discomfiture about the city's convict past, but is now a draw card for tourists.<ref>Clark, J. \"This Southern Outpost, Hobart 1846\u20131914\" pp. 1</ref> Regions within the city centre, such as [[Salamanca Place]], contain many of the city's heritage-listed buildings.

Completed in 1840, it was used as Tasmania's parliament house, and is now commemorated by a pub bearing the same name (built in 1844) which is frequented by yachtsmen after they have completed the [[Sydney to Hobart yacht race]].\n\nHobart is also home to many historic churches. The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in Bathurst Street from 1834 to 1836, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. The Salamanca Place warehouses and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] were also constructed in this period. The Greek revival [[St. George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower, designed by James Blackburn, was added in 1847.

The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] on the Eastern Shore. A new team, [[Hobart Hurricanes]] represent the city in the [[Big Bash League]]. [[Bellerive Oval]] has been the breeding ground of some world class cricket players including the former Australia captain [[Ricky Ponting]].\n\nDespite [[Australian rules football]]'s huge popularity in the state of Tasmania, the state does not have a team in the [[Australian Football League]]. However, a [[Tasmanian AFL bid|bid for an Tasmanian AFL team]] is a popular topic among football fans. The State government is one of the potential sponsors of such a team. Local domestic club football is still played. [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian State League]] football features five clubs from Hobart, and other leagues such as [[Southern Football League (Tasmania)|Southern Football League]] and the Old Scholars Football Association are also played each Winter.\n\nThe city has two local [[rugby league]] football teams (Hobart Tigers and South Hobart Storm) that compete in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]].\n\nTasmania is not represented by teams in the [[National Rugby League|NRL]], [[Super Rugby]], [[ANZ Championship]], [[A-League]], or [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]].

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated passenger tram services, a [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. However, the tramway closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart.\n\nSuburban passenger trains, run by the Tasmanian Government Railways, were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the Tasman Limited, ceased running in 1978. Recently though there has been a push from the city, and increasingly from government, to establish a [[Riverline (Hobart)|light rail network]], intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks in a [[South Line, Tasmania|North South corridor]]; to help relieve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD.\n\nThe main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.\n\n[[File:HobartAirportTerminal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hobart International Airport]]]]\n\nFerry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, there has been the demise of a regular commuter ferry service \u2013 leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There is however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]].\n\nHobart is served by [[Hobart International Airport]] with flights to/from Melbourne ([[Qantas]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Jetstar Airways]] and [[Tiger Airways Australia]]); Sydney (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin); Brisbane (Virgin); Perth (Virgin); Gold Coast (Tiger Airways); and Adelaide (Jetstar).The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.\n\n[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|right|MONA ROMA ferry in the Port of Hobart]]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100&nbsp;million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]]. This upgrade was, in part, funded under a promise made during the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] by the Abbott government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/airport-runway-extension-works-under-way/news-story/6c6c0bbbfa533ce4b487b32956d37600|title=Airport works under way|access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{See also|Category:People from Hobart}}\n\n===Arts===\n[[File:Errol Flynn1.jpg|200px|thumb|Actor [[Errol Flynn]] was born in Hobart in 1909.]]\n\n* [[Asta (musician)|Asta]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Phillip Borsos]], best known for his films ''[[The Mean Season]]'' (1985) and ''[[One Magic Christmas]]'' (1985)\n* [[Essie Davis]], actress\n* [[Richard Flanagan]], author\n* [[Errol Flynn]], Hollywood actor\n* [[Frederick Frith]], painter and photographer\n* [[Lisa Gormley]], English-born Australian actress best known for playing [[Bianca Scott]] on the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] serial drama ''[[Home and Away]]''\n* [[Lucky Grills]], best known for portraying the unconventional detective \"Bluey\" Hills in the television series ''[[Bluey (TV series)|Bluey]]'' in 1976.\n* [[Robert Grubb]], actor\n* [[John Harwood (writer)|John Harwood]], writer and poet\n* [[Ernest Higgins|Ernest]], [[Tasman Higgins|Tasman]] and [[Arthur Higgins]], brothers and pioneering [[cinematographer]]s during the [[silent era]]\n* [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], Australian classical composer\n* [[William Kermode]], artist\n* [[Constantine Koukias]], a Greek-Australian composer and [[flautist]]\n* [[Louise Lovely]], the first Australian motion picture actress to find success in Hollywood\n* [[Dennis Miller (Australian actor)|Dennis Miller]], actor best known for his recurring role on ''[[Blue Heelers]]'' as Ex-Sergeant [[List of recurring Blue Heelers characters#Pat Doyle|Pat Doyle]] (1994\u20132000).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588223/|title=Dennis Miller (II)|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]], most noted for playing the long-running role of Terry Sullivan in the Australian television series [[The Sullivans]].\n* [[Tara Morice]], actress\n* [[Gerda Nicolson]], actress\n* [[Glenn Richards]], musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist with [[Augie March]]\n* [[Brian Ritchie]], musician, bassist of [[Violent Femmes]]\n* [[Clive Sansom]], poet and playwright\n* [[Don Sharp]], actor\n* [[Michael Siberry]], actor\n* [[Jaason Simmons]], actor best known for his role as life guard [[Logan Fowler]] in the TV series ''[[Baywatch]]''\n* [[Freya Stafford]], actress who has appeared on TV programs such as ''[[Head Start (TV series)|Head Start]]'' and ''[[White Collar Blue]]'' and the 2010 horror film, ''[[The Clinic (2010 film)|The Clinic]]''\n* [[Amali Ward#Amali Ward|Amali Ward]], ''[[Australian Idol (season 2)|Australian Idol]]'' Season 2 finalist\n* [[Charles A.
